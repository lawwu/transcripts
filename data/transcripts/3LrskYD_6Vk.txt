[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]   Hey everybody, it's me, Jason Calacanis. Welcome, welcome.
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.440]   Hey everybody, it's me, Jason.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.720]   Thank God Trump's out.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.920]   I hate Trump, and I love myself.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:34.100]   Hey everybody, happy days are here again.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.140]   Champagne cart of bottles popping, boof, clinko again.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.900]   Happy days are here again.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.600]   Yay, Sachs is so happy Trump's out of office.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.460]   He gave an amazing speech about how great Biden's inauguration was.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.420]   Welcome to the All In Podcast.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.940]   Oh my gosh.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.220]   With me today in our post-inauguration afterglow is the dictator,
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.840]   the queen of quinoa, David Friedberg,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   and rock star,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.680]   Biden, the blue wave, diving in.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.540]   No more red pills.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.680]   The blue wave is David.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.520]   Rain Man Sachs is with us.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.520]   David, how did it feel to watch Biden's inauguration speech,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.360]   which you said hit all the notes,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.680]   and I see you wearing blue today.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.240]   Let me have a sip of my boof, clinko,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   and tell us you've got the blue jacket,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.600]   the blue shirt, and the blue headset on.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   You've ridden the blue wave.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.920]   Tell us how you feel with Biden in office.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.000]   I'm going to drink my boof.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.120]   Jason, I'm just happy to see that you're happy.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.640]   Ah.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.860]   And does this mean that your Trump derangement is over?
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.080]   You've gone cold turkey?
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   You're on the wagon?
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   And I'm just happy to have my friend back
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.000]   and not have you part of this Trump derangement zombie horde
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.820]   that you've been in for the last few years.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.980]   I'll tell you two quick stories.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.220]   The first one turned out not to be true,
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.600]   but there was a New York Times alert
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.520]   that came out this weekend saying that
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.800]   they were going to lift the travel ban.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   And for a moment, I was a little in shock.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.180]   And I'm Canadian.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.280]   My family's in Canada.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.200]   I haven't seen them in a year.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.620]   My mom is 80 years old.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.880]   I haven't seen her in a year.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   I haven't seen her in a year.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.040]   And then the second was on the day of the inauguration,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.740]   Biden signed an EO, I guess, that starts to basically create
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.180]   a path to citizenship.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.040]   And there are two women in my life
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.220]   who I think are just lovely, lovely people who I've never
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.680]   been able to hire.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   And now this gives us a path to hire them.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   And I think that's a great way to kind of
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   kind of get them to the point where they're like,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   "Oh, I'm going to go to the United States."
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   And I think that's a great way to kind of
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   kind of get them to the point where they're like,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   "Oh, I'm going to go to the United States."
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   And I think that's a great way to kind of
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   kind of get them to the point where they're like,
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   "Oh, I'm going to go to the United States."
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   And I think that's a great way to kind of
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   kind of get them to the point where they're like,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   "Oh, I'm going to go to the United States."
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680]   And I think that's a great way to kind of
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   kind of get them to the point where they're like,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   "Oh, I'm going to go to the United States."
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   And like simple, humane, good things.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   And I'm not trying to sort of jump on the Biden bandwagon.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   I think that he's got a lot of work to do.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   But I do think that just at a level,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   simple, basic level of humanity,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   it was a different, it was a big sea change.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   How did you take it, Freeberg?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   I'm curious, did you cry as well?
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   I observed the inauguration.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   It was interesting.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   Oh, we didn't upgrade your firmware, sorry.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.680]   We were supposed to push the two David firmwares
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.480]   for the ability to cry.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   But did you feel any emotion?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.480]   Of the three emotions we've given you in your programming,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   did any of them move at all?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   I don't remember.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   I mean, I don't remember the origin
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   of my non-emotional characterization, Jason.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   But yeah, I think it was-
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   It's just based on every interaction
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   we've ever had with you, but continue.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   Right, I guess that makes sense.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   So I feel like the Biden moment on inauguration day,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   it really did feel like a sigh of relief
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   because so much of Trump, love him or hate him,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   has been driven by a degree of tension, right?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   I mean, he came in to office on the premise
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   that he was gonna drain the swamp.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   I mean, that's kind of a very kind of active position.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   He's gonna go in, he's gonna change things.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   And I think the Biden tone is like,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   let's take it down a notch.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   Let's all take a deep breath.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   And I feel like that generated a collective sigh of relief.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   I'll also say that I watched that with the eyes
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   of someone who voted for Trump.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   I didn't vote for Trump, but I don't think I voted this year.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   I can't remember, it was in the middle of the pandemic.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   But I basically feel like there was a lot of folks,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   it's easy to say, let's unite the country
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   when you're on the winning side.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.080]   And when you're not, and you're sitting there
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.880]   and your guy got kicked out of office,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   and your guy claimed that he got kicked out
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   because of fraudulent activity,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   and you're one of the 46% of Americans
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   that are already disapproving of Biden's performance
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   in his first two days of office.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   You don't look at that as a moment of relief.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   You don't look at that as a moment of respite.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   And I feel like there's a little bit of a missed point of view
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   in terms of how we're all covering it and talking about it.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   It certainly feels good to take the tension down
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.680]   and take a deep breath and have leadership not be putting the tension down.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   But there's a lot of anger and disappointment
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   still festering out there.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.680]   And I think we need to be very cognizant of why and what we can do.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   And it would have been nice to see Biden not just say, let's unite,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   but actually step over the line and declare some of the policies
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   and points of view of the other side as being valid
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   and engaging more directly on those points
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   versus saying we'll all work together in the future.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   And we're already seeing this rift with McConnell and others
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   in terms of how to deal with the filibuster in a unified Senate.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   And I just don't think that we're going to be able
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   to make it that we're there.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   So, yeah.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   Sax, what are your thoughts?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   And then we'll go to you, Chamath.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   I mean, look, I'm not going to swoon over an octogenarian reading cliches
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   off a teleprompter.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   I just can't do it.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   Now, that being said, you know, the inauguration speech struck
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   all the right notes of, you know, reconciliation, lowering the temperature,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   coming together.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   These are the things you're supposed to say at an inauguration.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   These are the presidential layups, if you will.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.280]   It's kind of a weird thing that Trump could never quite get these layups in.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   Biden did what he was supposed to do.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   And I agree that there is a sense of relief in the temperature being lowered
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   and the situation in Washington feeling a bit depressurized.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.280]   And so I think he deserves credit for that.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   That's all for the good.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   I think the problem Biden's going to have is not just sort of the Trump right
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   opposing him, but the unsilver warriors in his own party.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.080]   You know, unsilver warriors, I think, was the most memorable line in his speech.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.880]   There are people, I think, you know, on the left who aren't really on board
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.080]   with the reconciliation agenda.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   I mean, shortly after the election, you had AOC proposing a truth and reconciliation
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   commission to go after everyone from the Trump era.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   I don't think that's exactly the kind of reconciliation Biden's talking about.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   You have, I think, the repressive hand of big tech playing into this revenge agenda
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   by acting as a speech cartel.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.880]   And now we have the rest of the tech stack jumping on board with the speech cartel.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   You had an announcement from a whole bunch of finance companies, PayPal, Stripe,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:09.680]   Square, that said they would cancel the accounts and by implication livelihoods of anyone connected to January 6.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   Well, what exactly does that mean?
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.880]   I mean, there were many thousands of people at this rally on the mall.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.680]   Only a few percent of them breached the Capitol and even smaller percentage engaged in violence.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   But everybody who was at the mall and really everyone in the MAGA movement is, quote unquote, connected.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.480]   So, you know, that's a lot of people.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall, but they're not getting out of the mall.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480]   So, you know, we've got a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   And I think that's a lot of people who are trying to get out of the mall.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.280]   that basically would create a domestic patriot act to uh to create giant new surveillance powers
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.480]   for the state to go after people they they deem to be traitors and seditionists and domestic
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.120]   terrorists um and you know i actually tweeted a letter by rashida to lay but the squad opposing
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.760]   this it's the first time i've stood with the squad i was proud to because the last thing the
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:12.200]   state needs right now is uh is more surveillance powers and this idea that we're fighting a war
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.920]   against fellow americans based on basically political dissent that's not going to create
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.760]   reconciliation that's going to lead to the next step in this horrible tit for tat game just to
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.520]   build on this for a second um there's a rasmussen poll that came out today today's friday january
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.560]   22nd so two days after the inauguration and biden's disapproval rating is 45 percent
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:42.200]   and you know all of a sudden you can think again as you said three days ago you know a lot of people
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.920]   were on the losing side and are now on the winning side and today um a lot of people that were on the
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.520]   winning side are quote unquote on the losing side and you see how reflexive the reaction is it's
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:01.000]   like an auto hate right it's like auto disapproval and so if that's the case it just it just begs the
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.400]   question
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.640]   how much room and how much tolerance will we have as a society if we start to go after folks that
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.720]   is you know that effectively have an enormous amount of political dissent are there fringes
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.480]   of both parties that need to get basically found out exposed and put in jail whether they're
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.720]   antifa on the left or you know the far right extremists on the right absolutely um but
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.680]   hopefully the fbi already has enough power to do that and that's already their remit and what we're
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.320]   not going to have to do is pass an enormous number of laws i mean i've said this before like the
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.560]   patriot act was so crazy because it was a foreign actor and a foreign event on domestic soil that
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.280]   created it but you know between the pandemic and now what happened in the capital a biological
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.920]   patriot act a domestic patriot act these are all in the offing and i think what we're going to have
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.840]   to do is again it sounds cheesy but find the common ground so that we can expose who are at
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.960]   the fringes of both parties who are the real crazy people around the world and then we're going to
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.120]   have to do is to round those folks up and deal with them with the laws that we have today because
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.840]   otherwise the unintended consequences for the overwhelming majority of the americans who are
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.520]   just normal folks is going to be a little scary i thought a really interesting reconciliation moment
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   happened with the woman who stole nancy pelosi's laptop i don't know if you guys were have read
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.240]   that story but uh this woman who stole the laptop and was considering selling it to the russians or
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.100]   she's 22 years old and she's obviously was misguided in doing this and the judge
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.060]   basically explained to her that she was releasing her to her mother's you know care and that her
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.660]   mother would go to jail if you know she did anything further but she said listen you know
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.580]   you're a beneficiary of the constitution you are getting a speedy trial you are getting
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:12:00.980]   representation and she used it almost as a civics lesson and i think we had a discussion maybe two
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.640]   episodes when the pod got a little hot um which was great for ratings by the way
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.760]   and for our relationships and it resulted in a reconciliation dinner that we had
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   a little a little uh wives dinner our wives brought us together for dinner to just make
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   sure everything was on the well chamath chamath brought us together for dinner
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.680]   and brought wives and brought wives yeah and uh no i mean it was it was a good thing because
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.720]   frankly jason i was starting to hate you just just a little bit just a little bit but uh
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.100]   but but i could feel the hate you know and uh chamath uh being uh empathetic as he is recognize
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.980]   the situation and uh so we've decided to do you know at least a quarterly besties dinner
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.940]   to make sure that uh yeah that the contentiousness does not get out of hand and interfere with our
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.240]   friendships which are more important than our politics ultimately that's what we all hope
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:00.460]   is comes out of this podcast which is a deeper understanding and reconciliation of of issues that
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.500]   we disagree on and breaking bread having a meal or having a civil conversation even if it gets a
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.980]   little heated keeping it civil is important i thought that this is the way to handle it
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.820]   a lot of these we're going to be able to use some amount of judgment on the people
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:20.920]   who storm the capital and say okay this person's misguided they took a selfie this person broke
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.480]   windows and then this person you know threw a fire extinguisher at a cop and we have to make
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.920]   sure that the justice system is deployed in in a fair way and
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.280]   that we're not going to be able to do anything about it and i think that's the way to do it
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.400]   and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.440]   way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's the way to do it and i think that's
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.040]   single person involved, find the appropriate crime, make sure that they're punished. But the idea of
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   passing broad sweeping surveillance powers over every American citizen is fucking nuts.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.640]   It's bonkers. And by the way, all that's going to do is create these honeypots for
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.280]   foreign governments to want to attack anyways, because if that capability exists, it exists in
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.840]   code, on servers, somewhere, and folks in China and other places will want to find out where that
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.240]   is, and they will be attacking it all day long. And so the last thing we need is we're already
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.280]   leaking enough information about ourselves online willingly and unwittingly. I don't want there to be
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.880]   a honeypot. That's the first thing. The second thing I just want to say is I thought it was
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.800]   incredible. What Mitch McConnell did just back to your comment, Jason, about making sure folks get
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.080]   the right adjudication. I think Mitch McConnell set the stage to have Donald Trump impeached.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.600]   And the reason I think that is this was the first time
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   he was completely unequivocal, which is that Donald Trump provoked all these folks.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.440]   And I think what it allows the Republican Party to do is to get together under closed doors,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.520]   behind closed doors, circle the wagons and say, it's either him or us, we choose right now.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.000]   And I think what's going to happen, if I had to guess, is that that allows a lot of people to
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.800]   break ranks and support the impeachment in the Senate that's going to start on Monday.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.280]   And I think there's a real chance now that this impeachment goes through and he gets convicted.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.520]   Jason Wong:
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.480]   I think it's worth just thinking about the implications of that. If you did that,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.960]   there are Trump loyalists, there aren't really GOP loyalists. And I guess there are GOP loyalists,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.000]   but there are a lot of Trump loyalists that are not loyal to the GOP at this point. And Sax,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.880]   correct me if I'm wrong, but if Trump does actually create a fringe party, does create a
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   patriot party, as he suggested he might, you could see up to 20 million Americans joining that party.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.800]   That would reduce the ranks of the Republican Party significantly. And in kind of,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.240]   my understanding is in political theory, what would result is you always have a balance in
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.120]   the parties. And so the parties kind of adjust left or right to create that balance. Ultimately,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.080]   it's just kind of the organic way this works. In order for the Republican Party to gain,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.800]   you would probably see a lot of membership move over to the Republican Party, which means that the
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.440]   Democratic Party is going to move further left. And, you know, think about the implications.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.240]   If Trump does act, if they do actually kick Trump out of the party, and he does set up a fringe
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.360]   party, you will likely see the Democrats move further left, creating a much more kind of
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   conflicting story for some of the centrists than what they're telling today of what's going to
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.000]   happen in the future. And that's a very different America in the next two to three years that could
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.280]   be created if they took that risk. And I think they have to associate that calculus when they're
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.960]   making this decision. You know, you can talk about justice and wanting to kick them out of the party.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.160]   The implications of him leaving the party are rather profound.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.240]   Oh, it would fracture the Republican Party. It would be,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.760]   I guess the best historical analog would be when Teddy Roosevelt left the party to form the Bull
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.400]   Moose Party. He actually fractured the Republican Party and that allowed, I think, Woodrow Wilson to
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   win the presidency, beating Taft. Yeah, I mean, the Republicans would basically lose every election
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.280]   from now until Trump is no longer, you know, a force in American politics. If
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.640]   he created, I guess the... Or they'd have to move left, right? I mean, in order for them to gain,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.680]   you know, more people, they'd have to get the centrist Democrats. They'd have to move left,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.040]   and that'll give the Democrats the ability to move left. Yeah, I mean, it would be a dream scenario
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:31.760]   for the Democrat Party. I'm surprised. I'd be surprised at the end of the day if enough
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:39.600]   Republicans went along with this to fracture the party. But look, I understand that on some basis,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   you know, Trump caused what happened at the Capitol. He convened everybody. He rabble-roused.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.560]   But I think that, frankly, if you have a trial, I think the question we have to ask is, like,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.880]   what agendas does this serve? Does this serve a reconciliation agenda, or does this serve a
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.240]   revenge agenda? I mean, the guy's already out of office. I thought we canceled the Trump reality
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.400]   show, and this is like bringing it back for another season. Because this trial is going
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.120]   to be a shit show. Just like all things Trump, you have a trial in the Senate, and it's going to turn
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:18.000]   into a total farce, okay? And, you know, look, I think cosmically, Trump was reckless. He was
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.960]   responsible. But when you actually look at the legal definition of incitement, it's actually
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.280]   very hard to prove incitement. So now Trump's going to get his lawyers up there, and they're
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   going to be pushing back on this, and it's going to consume the country for months. And I just think
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.040]   we should be moving forward right now. The guy's already out of office. I thought it was going to
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.080]   be three days and done. Why would it take months? I'm curious. You're just saying you overhang from
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.040]   it? Well, the best feeling is that it's going to be three days. Well, I'm— Well, they're talking
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.840]   about the best feeling. They're going to start at mid-February, right? It's not going to be
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.880]   three days. This goes on until the trial's over. I mean, it'll be at least a week of discussion,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:59.520]   right, Sax? So, Sax, is it— Do you think the GOP preventing Trump from being able to run again
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:06.000]   is worth the week of animosity, let's call it? I don't— I think we should just move on
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.960]   as a country. And I, you know, at the end of the day, I think that's what's good for Biden's agenda
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.520]   I mean, this will become very consuming. What's good for the GOP, though? If you're—
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.760]   as a person who would align themselves with Republicans mainly, I would say,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.440]   what do you think is best for your party, the party you're a part of?
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.960]   Just moving on. Just moving forward. What if Trump comes back and gets the nomination in 2024?
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.360]   I mean, I think that is definitely a risk you take, but I think that—
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.800]   Do you want to take that risk? I'll leave it to the voters to decide what makes sense.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.880]   Got it. Okay. Interesting.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.280]   I think that the only salvation for the Republicans is to repudiate Trump.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:52.960]   And I actually agree with Friedberg. I think that this creates the opportunity for this— I think
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.640]   Trump wants to call it the Patriot Party— to be sort of center-right. I think Democrats probably
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.320]   ebb over time, you know, center-left. And then the Republicans actually are this interesting power
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.680]   broker because they can actually tack to the middle and be centrist, you know, about a social
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.800]   safety net combined with a social safety net combined with a social safety net combined with
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.360]   a social safety net combined with, you know, small government. If you could somehow
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   tiptoe and balance on that line, I think that is the winning strategy that people want.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.320]   But I think that's my point is the Republican Party is going to have to move left in order to
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.360]   create balance between the two parties again, because they are going to lose 20 million voters
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   to the Patriot Party. And that's the profound shift that's going to happen. And when the
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.800]   Republican Party moves left, the Democrats are going to move further left. And so—
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.720]   Maybe. I don't think that moving that far left is going to be a good idea. I think that's a good
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:40.960]   strategy. I think that's a good strategy. I think that's a good strategy. I think that's a good strategy.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.040]   is a really winning strategy for them. No, but I think Friedberg is right. So as an example,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.680]   I think I can say this, but like I had a call this week with the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:21:02.160]   What an unbelievably impressive guy. Holy fucking shit, this guy is amazing. What he's done in Miami
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:10.080]   is incredible. I mean, the GDP growth is like Chinese GDP growth, 10%, 8%, 6.5%. He's running
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.640]   fiscal service, he's running the government, he's running the government, he's running the government,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.040]   he's running the government, he's running the government, he's running the government, he's running
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.360]   the government, he's running the government, he's running the government, he's running the government,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.400]   crime is down, down, down. He's done an incredible job. This guy's a fundamental centrist.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.520]   And when you talk about what his beliefs are, I was like, what is this guy? Is he a Democrat? Is
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.160]   he a Republican? He's like, honestly, I'm a centrist. And so my point is, if whoever tacks
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:36.320]   to the middle will find the ability to attract incredible leaders that I think are our next
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.560]   generation set of leadership. So in that way, Trump,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   as a change agent, Sachs was a success in that he broke the system. And this was Peter Thiel's kind
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   of concept when he put him in. And I know you don't speak for Peter, but Peter's idea was, hey,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.120]   this person is a change agent, he's going to be this, you know, drain the swamp. So maybe that
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.680]   didn't happen. But he has basically made everybody reconsider what party they want to be part of and
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.600]   what they actually want on the political agenda. And now we've never been more focused on politics,
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.480]   and how our country runs.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.440]   And I think that's what's really interesting about this. And I think that's what's really
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.080]   interesting about this. And I think that's what's really interesting about this. And I think that's
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.480]   what's really interesting about this. And I think that's what's really interesting about this.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.600]   Well, you're right that Trump was a classic disruptor. You know, Keith Ravoy has this line
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.720]   about founders that disruption is created by disruptive people. And Trump was, you know,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.960]   one of those very disruptive people. I mean, just to take two examples, I mean,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   he created a total realignment on our views around China. I think it's now a bipartisan
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   consensus that, you know, we should not keep feeding China and making, you know, keep feeding
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.760]   the Chinese tiger and turning into a dragon. Everyone seems to think now that some reappraisal
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.960]   is warranted. And the other big issue was the forever wars of the Middle East. You know, I think
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   Trump first created a realignment within the Republican Party when he said no more Bushes,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.800]   he meant no more of these stupid foreign wars. And I think that was an important realignment.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.480]   So yeah, I mean, he's been a very disruptive figure. I think that
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.320]   everyone's breathing a sigh of relief because we've moved on. I think that he unnecessarily
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.000]   was incendiary and sort of pressurized the situation. But I think the best thing at this
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.960]   point is to move forward and not keep rehashing the Trump era.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:27.200]   Speaking of rehashing, I don't know if you guys know about what is happening with Facebook,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.520]   but they have an oversight board they created last year in the spring. And the oversight
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.840]   board is not to do the day to day policing of Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp activity, but
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.920]   it's to be a place where people who have been have had content removed or have had their accounts
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:54.320]   suspended to appeal. They have taken the Trump case as it were and given it to their Supreme
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.400]   Court, which is the oversight board. And the oversight board is going to make a judgment
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:06.160]   basically on should Trump get his social media accounts back. They have complete autonomy from
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   Facebook. They are funded by Facebook with 120 or $130 million.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.400]   Over the next six years. So they're getting like $20 million a year to run this. They've got a
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:21.040]   really amazing bench of intellectuals, public intellectuals, and they're sort of above Facebook
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.680]   in this regard. What do we think should happen to Trump's social media accounts? Should he have
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.320]   a path to reclaiming them? And with this board that exists as this a budsman, as I talked about
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.080]   in the last episode, what do we think of this process? And do we think maybe Twitter and
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   YouTube should join this oversight board? Let's separate these two things. And actually,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.280]   Jason, you just framed it perfectly. Let's separate the two issues. One is,
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.800]   is any of us comfortable with a random set of people that some people will like and other people
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   not like making these decisions on our behalf that are not necessarily trained to make these
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.000]   decisions? I mean, these aren't elected trained judges or lawyers that sit for a bar exam. These
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.280]   are just private citizens ultimately at the end of the day. I think that if you allow this to happen
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.000]   at scale, I think that if you allow this to happen at scale, you're going to be able to do a lot of
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.360]   things. There's going to be a bunch of decisions that you'll be okay with and support. I think a
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.880]   lot of people probably are cheering when Trump got blocked. But if you can abstract it away and think
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.200]   about all the people that you actually care about, what if the administration was on the other side,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.280]   and now all of a sudden, you know, these people to curry favor with the administration went in
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.160]   a different direction and people that you cared about got blocked. It is an untenable situation.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.040]   And I think this is the slippery slope that the framers never intended. I don't think it should
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.080]   be people like this, making any decision like this. I think it's a slippery slope that the
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.920]   framers never intended. I don't think it should be people like this, making any decision like
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.640]   this. And in many ways, it's a, it's a fig leaf for these companies to pretend they're doing the
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   right thing while they're really shirking the real responsibility. Friedberg, do you agree?
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.640]   It's hard to say on the specific. So I think we should just take a broader point of view on this,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:00.240]   which is how do tech companies create independence in the platforms that they're
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.960]   building so that they don't get scrutinized as monopolists. And so there are several
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.120]   examples of this being done both successfully and not successfully across
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   the tech ecosystem. Google made Android open sourced. And by making the Android operating
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.800]   system open source, they were able to have their own forked versions that they were able to install
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.400]   on phones with partners like HTC and Samsung and others, that they could then have their search
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.200]   engine be the primary search engine. So the entire Android operating system is available
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.840]   for anyone to work on for anyone to fork for anyone to use. And then Google's iteration of
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.800]   that open source platform and Google's contributions, which they were making
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.320]   regularly, allowed them to kind of have a great commercial outcome without being the
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.680]   owner of the operating system, having learned from the mistakes of Microsoft in the past.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.280]   Facebook tried to take a similar approach with Libra, and it was a total shit show and a disaster.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   I don't know where it is today. But they tried to create this also independent board
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:04.480]   to provide oversight and to, you know, to kind of do the, you know, all the open source work
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.320]   on the Libra currency. And Facebook was going to then use that on their platform
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.320]   to try to get a better kind of, you know, token, cryptocurrency solution. And obviously,
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.920]   there was so much scrutiny because no one believed the independence. And I think we're hearing the
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.320]   same thing now about the Facebook oversight board. Jack Dorsey is now taking the same approach with
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.960]   Blue Sky, which is meant to be this open sourced, you know, independently managed
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   social media protocol system. And so Twitter would effectively become an application layer on top of
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.960]   the Facebook oversight board. And so, you know, we're seeing a lot of this, you know,
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.080]   the big tech platforms in order to be able to do this, you know,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.680]   they're not going to be able to do it. And so, you know, we're seeing a lot of this
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   kind of open source approach to how do you decide what goes on social media? How do you decide what's
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.880]   inappropriate and appropriate? And what technology protocols are available for everyone to use and
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.240]   what business and arbitration protocols are available for everyone to use in an open sourced
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.520]   way. And we'll see where Jack goes with Blue Sky. He seems to be doing a better job messaging
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.080]   the media in order to avoid the monopolistic allegations and the allegations of control and
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.440]   influence. They're creating independence, independent systems, and the tit or miss.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.280]   And I don't think we yet know, I think in the next year or two, we'll see how Blue Sky,
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.320]   Libra, the Facebook oversight board and some of these other platform.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.280]   What would you do, David? What would you do? Let me just put it to you. If you were in charge,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   you were the CEO of Facebook or Twitter. Would you have a path to reinstating Trump? Yes or no?
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.440]   Can I jump in on that?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.440]   Yeah, let me just get freebergs. Would you?
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.040]   Yes or no? reinstate Trump?
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.960]   Oh, yeah, 100%. We should have a path to it. I think the like I've said in the past,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.880]   having some objective, I think that number one, I don't think it was inappropriate for them to kick
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.280]   him off the platform from a legal perspective. I don't. Saxon, I might disagree, but we can
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.920]   probably argue for an hour. But I think from a freedom of speech point of view,
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.800]   they're private companies with private accounts, and they did what they wanted to do.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.840]   Was it the right thing to do? I don't think that was the right thing.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.520]   So you give them a path to getting his account back for so I think you need to create an
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.360]   objective system. And you need to give everyone whether it's Trump or whomever else, everyone
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.640]   has to have the same set of standards that they're held to and then a universal approach that anyone
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.280]   can appeal and okay, but that's the approach. But knowing what Trump did on January six,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.200]   would you let him back on your platform if you were CEO? Is the question I'm trying to get out
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.280]   of your freebird. But okay, David, you go. Yeah, I mean, so so here's the fundamental
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.040]   problem is that the town square is now owned by Facebook and Twitter, the town square got
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.880]   privatized. And our speech rights are now in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey as a
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.160]   matter. I mean, you do not have speech rights in the modern world if you get deplatformed by big
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.360]   tech. And until now, there's been no way to appeal their decisions. We have had no transparency into
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.160]   their decision. So I think Facebook creating this appeals board is a step in the right direction.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.960]   But you know, they're calling it their Supreme Court. But I'll tell you, my Supreme Court is the
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.360]   Supreme Court, you know, at the end of the day, we all know that the most important part of a trial
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:09.200]   is jury selection. And Zuckerberg is still picking these 20 people. And you know, actually, just in
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.480]   case in point, he picked the top, he picked the four and the four pick the next 16. And then they
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   don't have an ongoing ability to pick the next ones. And they have some amount of terms. So just
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.400]   to give you Okay, well, fair enough. And like I said, look, I don't want to
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.560]   criticize this move on its own, because it is a step in the right direction. We need
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.640]   an appeals process when people get canceled. Okay. That part is good. But what I would like to see,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.120]   like I said, my Supreme Court is the Supreme Court, and they've spoken to this issue. And I would like to
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.360]   see these social networking monopolies apply a First Amendment standard, a speech policy broadly
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.720]   consistent with the First Amendment. And sometimes that will mean allowing speech we don't like,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.480]   but it will result in a greater level of speech protection for all of us.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.720]   Well, it would be back on the platform. No, but hold on a sec, if you're going to go by that
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.680]   standard. The problem is with this oversight board concept is that it completely violates exactly
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.040]   what the Supreme Court is meant to be, which is a country by country set of governance and standards.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.640]   And it's not just about the laws. Like I'm just looking at the oversight board people right now,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:19.040]   these people look incredibly well credentialed. Emmy Palmore of Israel, Catalina Botero Marino of
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.160]   Colombia, Nigat Dad from Pakistan, Helle Thorning-Schmidt from Denmark, Catherine Chen from
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.320]   Taiwan, Jamal Green from the United States, Alan Rusbridger from UK, Andreas Sajo from Hungary,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:38.240]   and it goes on and on. How are we supposed to adjudicate a set of standards at a national level?
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.120]   We have the are all these people from all these different countries supposed to apply on US
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.240]   constitutional right of free speech and have an idea would be they would use some global standard,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.600]   but then also take into consideration local standards. That's what they've their stated
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.960]   purposes and why they're so diverse. The setup for that though, Jason,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.920]   is that then we know when, when there's a, you know, the Hindu nationalist BJP party has a
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.480]   specific point of view. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be specific kinds of
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.160]   free speech laws there. You know, Poland's gonna have a different point of view, and they're not
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.880]   going to respect the free speech laws. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.200]   specific kinds of free speech laws. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   specific kinds of free speech laws. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.480]   specific kinds of free speech laws. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.440]   specific kinds of free speech laws. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.840]   case in point. Australia passed a potential law, or is considering passing a law, which is basically
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.600]   around if you know, treating Facebook and Google as quasi publishers and that, you know, they're,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.440]   I think that they have to pay some kind of royalty now for articles that are shared or published or
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.400]   whatever. And Google said, I'm out. And then Facebook said, I'm out too.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.800]   And so what does that mean for, you know, 200 million people, you're
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.480]   out? What does that mean? You're out, you can make money when the gettings good. And all of a sudden,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.680]   you build this public infrastructure, when the country's rules change, I actually respect that
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.320]   more than trying to create some of this broad, holistic governance committee, because I think
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.280]   it's a shit show. You can't cherry pick which laws you want to observe and respect and, and then which
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.000]   laws you don't.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.640]   Yeah, I think Chamath makes an excellent point about how difficult this is going to be to
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.720]   implement. Let me propose an alternative that actually comes from former law professor of mine
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.120]   University of Chicago, Richard Epstein, he made the point that he wants to apply common carrier
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.880]   regulation, at least in the US to these monopolies. And the example he gives is that the
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.760]   railroad monopolies could not deny you service based on your political views. And you know, this
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.360]   is this is a this is a real issue. Imagine, you know, going back in time, you know, we had the
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.080]   Lincoln Douglas debates, for example, the way that Lincoln and Douglas went around the country was by
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.640]   train. Imagine if some railroad
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.080]   magnate, some oligarch said, Mr. Lincoln, I don't like your views, I'm not going to give you passage
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.800]   on my railroad monopoly. The common carrier rules would have prevented them from doing that. And what
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:58.160]   Epstein suggests we do is if you're a essentially a monopoly, a speech monopoly in the in the US,
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.520]   one of these platforms that has, you know, the gigantic network effects, you have to apply
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.560]   the common carrier rules. It's an interesting concept, I think, let's move on to
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.160]   the economy. And it'd be very interesting. We'll monitor obviously, what the this oversight board
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   does, we're going to monitor what's going to happen with this January six.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.600]   In the way that sorry, Jason, the last thing on this is you can tell if you if you
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.280]   graphed and I'm sure somebody listening to all in can graph and tweet this, but
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:38.480]   if you graphed the price to earnings ratio of big tech, has all of these issues,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.000]   have come out like, you know, if you looked at a time series of their PE,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.240]   and you put on their, you know, things like George Floyd, things like the capital riots,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.000]   you know, all of these things that have created these flashpoint issues around free speech,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   flashpoints, the massacre in New Zealand and Christchurch that was live streamed on Facebook,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.760]   all of this stuff, what you'll see is, at least capitalism is voting that these companies will not
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.400]   be allowed to be companies much longer. Mm hmm.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.920]   Smart money is betting that they're going to be regulated, and something's going to change,
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.760]   it's going to be a quasi governmental organization, exactly that the level of regulation at a
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.360]   government by government level is going to be so onerous as to make these companies quasi nonprofits
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   that work on behalf of countries, they're gonna become utilities, right, they're getting they're
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.880]   going to get regulated, like utilities at some point, or they're going to have to adopt some
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   governance, like we've talked about, or other options will emerge. And I think what Jack is
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.320]   doing with the, is it the government? Yeah, I think the government is going to adopt some governance,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.920]   the blue sky is what they're calling it blue sky. Yeah, yeah, what they're really doing with
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:48.960]   blue sky is saying your profile and your data is going to be stored on some blockchain or
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.760]   some decentralized system like Bitcoin, or like any other peer to peer service, which means
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.520]   it's not on their server, Twitter just pulls all that data together. So we would all have
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:08.240]   our own domain names and calacanis.com or sax.com slash profile dot, whatever the HTML equivalent is
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.680]   is, let's just call it dot social, you know, your sacks dot social URL would be your profile on
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.520]   Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else. And when you post it to it, it would post to Facebook and
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.200]   Twitter. Therefore, they could say we don't actually host this stuff. We're just pulling
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   it together, which then destroys their business model perch moths point. What do we think,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.280]   as a little aside is going to happen with the tick tock case.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.200]   Now that Trump is out of office and Biden is in office, we sort of alluded to China sacks being
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.680]   a super important thing that we all have consensus on now what should happen with tick tock? And do
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.040]   you think Biden will go after tick tock and say, Hey, we got to get this out of here because it's,
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.480]   you know, essentially spyware and jock ma was just resurfaced. And let's just talk
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:57.200]   about China for a second. Yeah, I think the sad reality is that the whole tick tock thing is
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.400]   going to get swept under the rug. I think there'll be no restrictions on tick tock.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.080]   I think what we need the issue with like, with banning tick tock, though, is that it's just
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.520]   one place where China can collect data on all of us. I mean, the reality is there's thousands of
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.800]   places. And so, you know, I do think that taking some action on tick tock is warranted, but it
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:25.200]   would it is a little bit of selective enforcement. But what I would like to see is some guarantee
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:31.120]   some assurance that that tick tock is not is collecting data in the way they're saying they're
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:38.000]   collecting it and that there's not sort of spyware within the app. And I don't think we know for sure.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.680]   Whether there's spyware or not, I'll say it. I'll say it slightly differently. I've maintained
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.120]   this for a while, but it is inconceivable that inside of big tech in every single
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:57.840]   company that you define big tech is not at least one spy from Russia, China, India, Israel,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:05.120]   Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Did I tell you guys I had a spy working for me? A climate?
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.920]   No, you got to rest. Did I tell you guys about this? No, tell us a
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.120]   story. It's public. So I'll share it. We had a data scientist named high tower, great guy,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.000]   worked on our remote sensing team, and worked on our nitrogen model, which predicted nitrogen
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.320]   content and soil and was very deep in the in the in the code base and everything. And shortly after
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:32.240]   I had left, I found out this climate just for the audience. My company I started and ran was
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.560]   acquired by Monsanto in 2013, which is a big seed company. A lot of people know it for other things.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:45.840]   And so I left and I found out that the guy quit, went to the airport, and the FBI intercepted him
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.880]   at the airport and they found tucked into his bag a thumb drive and he had downloaded all of
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.520]   our code base for our nitrogen models. And he was taking them to give them to the Chinese government.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.440]   And so he's in jail right now. He's in prison in the US right now. But this was like the most
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:06.400]   nondescript, super nice scientist, data scientist guy you've ever met, like you would have had zero
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.760]   suspicion. And, and it turns out, this is the part, how many of those exist in Facebook,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.520]   and it was so and by the way, it was so easy for him to get access to our code base. And he pulled
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.600]   all this stuff down. And he had the whole model. And you know, there's a lot of articles about what
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.920]   happened in our case. But you're right, it's happening all over the place. And, and I don't
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.480]   think that we fully appreciate like, how much of America's IP is stored in software,
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.320]   and data, and how accessible that is to employees inside of these organizations, and that the security
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.760]   is not adequate to protect that data and that IP.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.200]   And then the crazy thing is like, you know, when just to connect the two dots here on this
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.000]   Jack Muffin, like when you saw that video, where like, you know, basically, he was forced to,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.720]   you know, show fealty.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.360]   I'm okay.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.640]   I'm okay. And you know, this is all about the Chinese Party.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.840]   I'm not being held captive.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.320]   My gosh, like, I mean, these are all quasi governmental companies.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:06.240]   Alibaba exists, because of the largesse of the Communist Party.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.520]   And Xi Jinping, if that wasn't clear after last week, I mean, and so to your point, like, you know,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.120]   if any company gets a hold of US user data, or otherwise, it's effectively the Chinese government
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.080]   getting a hold of that data.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.560]   Yeah, we don't need proof, David, when Jack Ma disappears, and then comes back and looks,
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.400]   he looked nervous on that video. I'm no expert, but he did not look like he was the Jack Ma,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.440]   who was giving speeches and inspiring people.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.160]   And I don't know what this does to entrepreneurship in China. But I mean, who
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:42.400]   in China is going to start a company now and want to be the next Jack Ma or Jeff Bezos?
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   No, I think Jason, it's even simpler.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.200]   What happens?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.680]   It makes entrepreneurship even simpler, meaning for those entrepreneurs that thought that there
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.320]   was a balance between financial imperative and moral imperative, there's no balance.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.240]   You can flush the moral imperative down the fucking toilet. They, China will allow you to
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.200]   get super rich and super successful, as long as you super toe the line. And that's the message.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.440]   Right. It's like what Putin did with Khodorkovsky in Russia. It's like he basically told all the
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   oligarchs, you work for us now. And that's basically the message from the CCP to Jack Ma
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.800]   and to every other entrepreneur in China is you work for us now. And by the way,
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.480]   civil military fusion was a policy expressly announced by President Xi.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:36.000]   One other data point on this, I think it's really interesting is that Biden just,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.240]   announced that he was keeping on Christopher Wray as the head of the FBI.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:48.320]   Christopher Wray gave a speech back in July at the Hudson Institute about the counter espionage
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:55.360]   efforts that the FBI is engaged in. And he was saying that the FBI has more cases now related to
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:01.520]   Chinese counterintelligence. He said that the FBI is opening a new China related
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.000]   counterintelligence case every 10 hours.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.920]   Wow, two a day.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:12.080]   Two a day. And of the nearly 5000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.440]   across the country, almost half are related to China. So this is directly from a speech he gave
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.680]   in July. So I think it's really interesting. Now, at the time that he gave this speech,
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.520]   you know, a lot of people were saying, well, this is just Trump's more of Trump's China baiting.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.760]   But I think that by Biden keeping on Christopher Wray, there's a continuity of policy there.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.840]   And I think, you know, focusing on TikTok is probably the wrong thing. We need a more
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.720]   comprehensive policy to deal with counterintelligence.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.000]   Well, it's a good start, though, to say if you hit scale,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.440]   we're not going to let you operate here. And we want reciprocity. Adding to this
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:53.120]   outgoing Secretary of Pompeo and is the day before the inauguration, tweeted, I have determined that
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:59.040]   the People's Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in China
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:05.760]   targeting the Uyghurs, Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups. That's quite a bomb.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:12.720]   And I think this signals we are going to keep resetting this relationship. And what an
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.480]   incredible opportunity for us to bring factories back here bring, as we've talked about here,
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.040]   manufacturing back, correct, Freiburg?
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.600]   That's what I think. Let's kick it off. We got we got 3 million factories in China. I think we've
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.720]   got less than 100,000 in America. Let's go.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.600]   It will be so glorious. It will be so fucking glorious. I mean, think about this, right? Look,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.920]   think about the amount of money like at the end of the day, what is a government's purpose? Is it to
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:45.040]   run a profit? No. You know, that's our job, right? Is it to run at breakeven? I would actually say no.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.200]   I think it's to basically promote the prosperity of current and future generations of its citizens.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.160]   And so you should be investing. So if you should be investing, so if we're going to be printing,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.440]   you know, trillions of dollars, and you know, we should talk about the stimulus bill,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.520]   because Biden's going to rip in another 2 trillion, which I think is a perfect and then
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.880]   by the way, and then after that, there's going to be this it's amazing infrastructure bill,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:14.640]   put the money to work. Let's reclaim a bunch of this capability on shore and let's re build
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.120]   America.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:21.280]   Okay, freeberg, you looked at the $1.2 trillion stimulus package that Biden is
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.600]   proposing. How much of that goes towards rebuilding factories in America?
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.320]   Well, none. So remember, there's
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:33.440]   Yeah, but it's 1.9 billion. It's 1.9 trillion.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.640]   1.9 trillion. Yeah.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.600]   And so just to put that in context, you know, Wall Street has talked about there were going to be
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.120]   four massive stimulus bills, you know, since last April, May, I think they've talked about this. And
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.800]   we're seeing this come to fruition now. And Chamath, correct me if you've heard differently,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.040]   but there's always been the expectation, we would have the big first stimulus, which we had last
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:58.000]   March, then a second stimulus, people have been waiting for the state stimulus or the local
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.640]   government stimulus, which this one now captures. And then the fourth program was always going to be
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.360]   infrastructure.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   And we haven't seen details of the proposed Biden infrastructure plan yet.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.960]   But I'm pretty sure it's going to have a lot of green energy stuff tied up in it. But let's just
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.440]   let's just hit the numbers, right. So in 2009, post financial crisis to keep the global economy
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:28.720]   from collapsing. Congress passed an $800 billion aid package. 800 billion was extraordinary at the
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.280]   time. And we've never seen anything like it. TARP. And last March,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:39.520]   if you'll recall, we passed this emergency $2 trillion package, you know, more than 2x what
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.000]   we had during the financial crisis. And now just in December, right before the year wrapped up,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.520]   Congress passed another $900 billion package. And now we're talking about this $1.9 trillion package
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:55.760]   getting passed. So we've eclipsed anything you could have ever considered possible in terms of
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.280]   fiscal stimulus. At this point, the M1 money supply, which I sent the link out ahead of this
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.200]   for Nick to share, has been a huge step forward. It's incredible.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:09.280]   It's gone up by 75% in just the past year. And now if we break down the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill,
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.520]   you know, a huge chunk of it, and this is what Wall Street's been waiting for,
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:19.040]   is $350 billion is going to state and local governments. So think about San Francisco,
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:24.080]   or the state of California, the city of Chicago, the city of New York,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.640]   all of these folks have seen their revenue decline. And they've had to run massive emergency
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.720]   programs. Where's that money coming from? They haven't been able to raise taxes, they've had to
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.120]   put a whole lot of money into it. And they've had to put a whole lot of money into it. And they've
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.400]   had to hold on receipts. And so this is meant to bridge the gap at the local level. And this
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:46.160]   is really important. Because so much of capital markets still very much fund local and state
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.640]   governments through municipal bonds. And those bonds, if they start to default are going to have
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.840]   a dangerous rippling effect in the economy. So bridging the state and local government budgets
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.240]   with this $350 billion package turned out to be, you know, an absolute need and be Republicans prior
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   to the election. We're pushing hard against this and saying, let those states fail. They're mostly
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.280]   blue states, let those cities fail. They're mostly blue cities, they're mismanaged, they're being
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.640]   stupid about how they're operating. So this is a big deal. There's 160 billion for COVID fighting,
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:23.200]   some of which, you know, I throw up on $20 billion for vaccination, which equates to about $150 per
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.120]   person they expect to vaccinate, which is an extraordinarily high cost. If you actually think
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.880]   about it on a first principles basis, it's ridiculous how inefficient they're going to be at
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.960]   this $50 billion for testing. So it's a huge cost. And it's a huge cost for the government. So it's
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.200]   a huge cost for the government. So it's a huge cost for the government. So it's a huge cost for
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.360]   the government. So it's a huge cost for the government. So it's a huge cost for the government.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.520]   $40 billion for protective gear and supplies. And what this indicates to me is so much of what goes
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.640]   on in government and government spending is skating to where the puck used to be not skating to where
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.440]   the puck is going. And it's almost like by the time this money gets deployed, I'm not sure we're
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.280]   going to need as much protective gear and supplies. I'm not sure we're going to need as much testing
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.520]   if we can actually get the vaccinations done in the next 90 to 100 days, and much of the country
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:02.560]   starts to recover from this. You've now got $150 billion program sitting out there that doesn't need
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.560]   out there and it's a waste of money. What we should be doing is taking that money and investing
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.320]   in biomanufacturing infrastructure so we can more quickly develop and deploy vaccines in the future.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:18.160]   What would it cost to build a factory just back of the envelope that was capable of making the next,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:25.600]   you know, let's call it one to two shots. It's not a lot. So let me I'll give you guys the
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:32.800]   unit economic build and you can do the math at home. Four grams per liter is the expected yield
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.400]   of a of a biomanufacturing facility and a liter is like you know how many liters of water do you
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:45.280]   have in a tank, you can build half million liter facilities for a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.760]   And that's four grams per liter every seven days. And a vaccine or the the the antibody therapies
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:57.520]   that we've seen the antibody therapies are about two grams and that'll save someone's life. The the
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.720]   vaccines are a fraction of a gram. And so you can start to kind of do the math on how just a few
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.420]   billion invested in building some of these biomanufacturing facilities that are modular
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:13.100]   and can be very quickly reprogrammed to make a new molecule can be used to support the
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.660]   future vaccine supply chain and the future antibody therapeutic supply chain, which is
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.820]   critically needed in this country. And if I were to take $160 billion for COVID fighting,
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:27.740]   give me 10% of that, and we'll be ready for any virus in the future. And we'll be able
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:32.060]   to print out vaccines for the whole country within 30 days. And so a little bit again
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.980]   of this is not really forward thinking it's scientists and doctors saying what they need,
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.960]   what they're talking about is last year's need. They're not thinking in terms of what
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.000]   the industrial supply chain needs are going to be in the future on an ongoing basis for
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.160]   this country at this point, I'm not seeing it. And so I feel a little bit let down by
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.400]   that. And I hope that the infrastructure programs that are going to be proposed in the next
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.940]   email in the next bill, we'll start to encompass some of that work.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:59.180]   Paradoxically, it's going to cost a trillion dollars to upgrade our nuclear weapons. So
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.400]   we're literally going to spend a trillion dollars over the next decade open.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.560]   Upgrading our nuclear.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.680]   That's a nutty statistic. Is that true? That's nutty.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.020]   That's right. I'm reading a headline right here.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:15.380]   Wow. Here's my little wish list for this infrastructure bill. I think when you look
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:20.340]   at some of the most compelling work that's happened in the developing world, so like,
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:26.420]   if you're going to go and, you know, build a massive water facility or an energy installation,
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.740]   a lot of people are worried, hey, listen, I have to deal with, you know,
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:36.320]   local currency risk. I have to deal with, you know, corruption. I could have the government,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.300]   you know, take away this facility from me without notice. The rule of law may not be strong. And the
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.860]   World Bank has this mechanism where you can basically go and insure, you know, for I think
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:52.160]   it's like 1% or 2% of your project cost, the whole project. And it really makes things work. I would
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:59.000]   love to see the US government effectively create a program that is similar but different in the
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.080]   following way. There are some enormous things that are going to happen in the future. But I think,
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:08.900]   you know, there are enormous things America needs to do where the IP exists with our allies. And
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:16.160]   there is an enormous fear, what would happen if that IP leaked specifically to China. One example
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:23.300]   is if you believe and you care about climate change, and the making of batteries, there's an
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:29.420]   enormous amount of IP that sits with the Japanese. That you know, if we could license and work with,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.200]   you know, the Japanese government, as a country, we could build factories all over the country. And
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.600]   we would be the leader in climate. But that'll take the US government to basically work bilaterally
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.340]   with the Japanese government to basically say, listen, if it takes the NSA to fucking protect
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:48.200]   this shit, we will do it. But you can send- Or you run them. We could just give them
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.640]   their sovereignty in those factories or something.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.420]   Yeah, you know, these are for profit companies that are, you know, relatively risk averse.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:57.860]   They're not going to rip in 10 million bucks to $10 billion to build, you know, a cathode plant in
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:03.680]   the US. I would, other people would. But that's my hope in the infrastructure bill is that we take
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.180]   some of these things that have worked in the developing world, and we use it to grease the
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.540]   skids in how we rebuild America, it would be fucking glorious.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.200]   And also just think about how much a nuclear power plant costs, it's like six to $9 billion
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:21.260]   to build a nuclear power plant. And we haven't built many new ones. And we're on the way there.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.000]   But if part of this trillion dollars, we could build 10 more of those, energy independence would
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.200]   continue and global warming would go down. Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.440]   Would go down. Anything to add there, David looks like you want to come.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:37.040]   Well, I just did just one final word, you know, the, the, the great Senate leader,
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.540]   Everett Dirksen famously said that, you know, billion here, a billion there,
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.040]   pretty soon, you're talking about real money. And now we're talking about a trillion here and
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:52.220]   a trillion there. And these are really big numbers. And I think we should be very concerned
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:56.360]   about debt and deficits. No one's really talking about this yet. But all of this money has to be
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.140]   paid back at some point.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.300]   Well, what's the worst that can happen, David, let's actually do that. I mean,
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.080]   I'm asking the question in a non joking way. What is the worst that can happen?
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.300]   Oh, I mean, inflation, inflation, inflation, well, not not just so inflation, because the
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:15.200]   government will eventually have to monetize the debt by printing more money. The dollar stops
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.100]   becoming the world's reserve currency, maybe Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency,
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:26.000]   maybe something else does. It could be lead to, you know, very severe, to basically a debt crisis
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.240]   in the future. What would that be? Well, I think it's going to be a very severe crisis in the future.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.660]   What would that look like for companies and citizens of America?
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.520]   Well, if you're middle, if you're middle class, your savings get wiped out, you know, if you so,
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.800]   so if you're super rich, the reality is there's already been tremendous asset inflation. So
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:45.080]   there's already been a lot of inflation. But frankly, if you are very rich and own assets in
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.940]   the stock market, you're you're sort of, you're protected, you know, but if you're a middle class
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:54.260]   person with most of your savings in your bank account, that money is not worth a lot less,
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.180]   or you're destroyed, or your home.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.120]   Yeah, you get destroyed by that. It's really very sad.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:04.340]   So if you are equities, and the market is on a rip, you know, paying an extra couple of million
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:09.080]   dollars for your second home is not a big deal, because your equities have gone up more than that
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:14.360]   or equal to that. And if you're right, somebody who get makes income, we have a separate issue.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:18.740]   Let's look, this is this is a this is a bigger issue. But but I think we should talk about this
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:23.540]   at some point, because this is what the grand fallacy of technology was supposed to be. Like,
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.060]   you know, if you if you break down capitalism into its,
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.800]   to most natural states, you have labor, and you have capital, right, you have workers,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.200]   and you have owners. And the biggest problem that technology did was it drove a wedge,
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:42.440]   and it created an extremely small owner class, and an extremely massive labor class. And so the
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:48.020]   reality is that a very few very handful of people can can get extremely wealthy by being owners of
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.720]   these next generation assets. And then everybody else is essentially, you know, rendered as labor.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.000]   And so this wealth inequality,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.020]   which is grows and grows and compounds. And so we have to figure out a way.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.980]   Yeah, how's that different than the past? Because I think it's got I think I think
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.420]   technology accelerated that dynamic. Well, I think is jumping in on this. I mean,
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:13.820]   I think that technology creates bigger winner take all outcomes. And that's fed into inequality. But
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.740]   the good thing about tech or the tech ecosystem is that frankly, we have option pools, right? We
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.840]   have broad based ownership of these companies. If you go work for a Google or Facebook, whatever,
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.940]   you get an option grant. No, come on.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.360]   That's 10,000 people. That's 10,000 people.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.080]   That's no one.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.320]   And they're and they're replacing 2 million jobs with 10,000 people.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.740]   I mean, this is why this is why we need to have 100% participation in the markets by everybody
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:44.120]   in the country. Joe Greenblatt, who I had on my podcast recently is a proponent of this chamath
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.800]   they saw you tweeting about it. When you're born in the United States, we should put $5,000 in a
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.880]   401k that you can't touch until you're 65 years old. That is in whatever index funds. And every
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.500]   person born gets that $5,000 and cannot touch it. And then we see where it winds up. I'm not sure.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:06.560]   It doesn't solve the problem that a lot of people have to climb up a hill first, right? They take on
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   a lot of debt to get education to put themselves in a position to ultimately be able to generate
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.840]   the income to do that. And I think, you know, sure, given $5,000 at the beginning, but it's
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.680]   not going to get them where they need to be. But it does solve one portion of the problem,
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:22.940]   which is they don't have participation. And we could take out the wondering both of you are
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.820]   going to be like, I think both of you are right. I think like there needs
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:32.000]   to be something that allows people to have a line of sight to savings, like a lot of about being
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.280]   invested in anything where you own it, whether it's real estate, or whether it's a piece of
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.080]   artwork, or whether it's stocks and bonds. So many people don't even know how to begin
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   and don't understand the concept of ownership. And so they are stuck in being in the ghetto of labor.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.280]   And I think like one of the biggest things we can do is you can give them the taste of ownership,
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.760]   so that they understand that difference so that they want to be an owner.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:01.340]   Yeah, okay. Number one, yes. And then to David's point, number two is we still have a responsibility
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:06.980]   to educate people so that they can actually have skills that they can monetize. And we have a
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:12.740]   responsibility to do that. And right now, we make it so fucking hard. And we trick people because
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.780]   like we, we send them down the path of getting a $200,000 art history degree, and then they end up
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:22.340]   working at a Starbucks and then there, which is impossible to monetize. I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.700]   You can't monetize that you can't. By the way, by the way, what you're saying to him,
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.500]   is the reason I think retirement accounts were set up in the US was to shift away from pension
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.760]   fund models where people were getting a fixed income at retirement, and shifting them to a
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.440]   model of equity and ownership in the markets where they could participate actively on a tax free
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.720]   basis. But obviously, it hasn't done enough. You know, I think the big difference between
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.920]   the Industrial Revolution, the first and second Industrial Revolution and where we are with
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:55.640]   software in the last two to three decades is the capital required, right? It's very little capital
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.500]   to build a highly valuable software business. It required a lot of capital to build oil infrastructure
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.180]   and railroad infrastructure and factories. And so to your point, you get extraordinarily different
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:11.660]   outsized returns today than you did 100 years ago, as an owner versus labor, that and the bridge to
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.980]   try and give people ownership through retirement accounts certainly hasn't been enough. And so
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:20.060]   so to your point, to your point, David, I saw this study, it was fucking crazy. I'm
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:25.580]   going to get the exact numbers wrong. But the trend is accurate. When when when
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:31.940]   people used to actively manage their 401k, there was a very small participation rate. But the mean
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:36.260]   return was off the charts and the amount of dollars as a function of their paycheck was off
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:42.620]   the charts, call it, you know, 5060 cents of every theoretical dollar you could put into it. The
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:48.380]   minute that we went to passive, and that you know, you could sort of trickle money in the number of
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:53.720]   people that participated literally more than doubled. But then the amount of that max dollar
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.520]   went off of a cliff. And then the number of people that participated literally more than doubled.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.760]   And so the problem that we've had is we haven't taught people, you know, we've misdirected some of
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.160]   them to say have a 401k, it replaces your pension, as if it's the solution, that's still not the
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:12.680]   solution. And we need to have ways of teaching people how to actually manage it. It's not that
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:19.520]   hard. And the basics can be taught very simply. But right now, we are massively exacerbating this
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:24.140]   wealth gap the way that we behave. And then all of this money that's going to go in this 1.9 trillion,
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:29.120]   whatever, how many trillion comes afterwards, is frankly, for the few that are smart enough to take
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.940]   advantage of it will be amazing, but it'll still push the overwhelming majority of Americans who
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.200]   are stuck in labor, deeper and deeper into that ghetto, and they'll never get up.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:45.320]   It is definitely every little bit helps, right? Like if you have the 401k, that helps. And then,
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:50.180]   you know, educate people. And I think if we gave everybody an ISA at birth, or an I, you know,
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.080]   an income sharing agreement for these 20 professions, and the government provided, why,
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.220]   Jason, why is it that, you know, for example, if to invest in a startup,
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:03.260]   you either have to have more than $5 million, or more than, you know, a million bucks a year,
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.100]   it's more than they're gonna change it. And so if you're, if you're a product manager,
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.900]   that's like really, really talented, or if you're like, you know, somebody else who's just got a,
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.540]   you know, a PhD in nuclear biology, and frankly, is, you know, is decided to teach for 60,000. And
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.920]   you can't participate, even though you have the intellect to judge. Like, we're just like, kind
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.020]   of like compounding. It's even worse than that.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.840]   The person who's changing the accreditation laws at the SEC and working on this said, I cannot,
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.480]   I'm writing the accreditation laws. And because I make 150k a year, whatever it is under 200k,
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.140]   I can't participate. And I'm the one responsible for the law.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.080]   That person must be one of the most sophisticated people in the world.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.800]   It literally is the most sophisticated person in the world when it comes to accreditation.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.960]   This is why we need to move to sophisticated investor, not accredited, and just some test.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   And if you did that, every single Uber,
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:00.800]   Lyft driver, Postmates driver, Airbnb host, or person who used the cash app or PayPal would have
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.880]   said I can as one of the first users, I have access to buy shares, I'm just gonna say this,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.040]   I'll buy them. This problem has to get fixed. Because I think in the next 10, I think in the
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:16.640]   next 10 and 20 years, the United States is going to fucking reemerge like a phoenix. And the reason
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.660]   the reason is going to because of innovation around climate change and agriculture and
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.900]   biotechnology and technology. These four areas are going to
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:31.160]   recast GDP. But what that also means is that we're going to create, you know, 20 or $30 trillion a year
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:39.320]   for the next 10 and 20 years, 300 500 trillion. How the fuck do we make sure that more than 18
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.600]   people participate? Absolutely.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.260]   Well, so I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying. But I can tell you every single one of the
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:52.640]   companies that I've invested in are looking to hire people right now. They cannot hire people
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.840]   soon enough. It's not a good idea. It's not a good idea. It's not a good idea.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.460]   It's their biggest challenge. And it's not just coders, it's salespeople, it's marketing people,
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:03.500]   it's HR people, it's every every role in their company, they have trouble trying to hire the
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.420]   right person. And and they give options to all those people. So it's not just a small number
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:14.240]   of founders getting equity. This is basically a new category of call it entrepreneurial labor.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.340]   It's labor who gets ownership in the company that's never existed before. And really,
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.780]   what this comes down to is we need more people participating in the new economy. If you
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.920]   participate in the new economy, then you get ownership. And if you're in the old economy,
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.840]   then you really are stuck in labor. And so what we need to do is spread the opportunity
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.120]   that that technology represents to more people across the minimum wage, maybe we should have
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.960]   a minimum equity participation. So we have the minimum wage over here. But if you're working
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.340]   for an entrepreneurial enterprise, why not get a minimum, you know, participation in equity?
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.820]   Because the free market takes care of that. I mean, if you have the free market,
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.720]   hasn't taken care of it, David. No, it has no, no, the free market has I agree with David,
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   the free market has the problem. How does a person working at Walmart ever participated
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.180]   in the Walmart appreciation? That's the point, they will, they will leave and go to a company
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.500]   that gives them equity. And that's why you'll see this. This is convenient to say, but if Walmart's
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:11.720]   the only job within an hour of their house, it's not. They got to have the right skills, Jason. And
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.880]   so this all comes back to education. You know, we got to we got to why not let the people who are in
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.340]   rank and file jobs, the 30 million truck drivers, cashiers, etc, have equity participation as a
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.660]   right. I think I think you're saying
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:29.240]   something different. Should they? Absolutely. Should the company that does that be created?
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.280]   Absolutely. Will they be rewarded with all the people that want to work there? Absolutely. So
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.800]   now somebody should go and start that fucking company.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.840]   Okay. I just think it's an interesting concept. I mean, we do have a minimum wage,
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.480]   why not have a minimum Jason, just participation, you know, the same woman that ran Elon out of
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.600]   California, Lorena Gonzalez, she's doing another thing now, who's proposed a new bill? Like, do you
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:59.720]   prefer to basically pick the equity thresholds? Because that's what you're saying? Well, no,
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:06.560]   let's pivot. Let's pivot to California. Okay, let's pivot to another disaster. So the recall
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.500]   is well on its way, they need to get 1.5 million signatures, we're at 1.1 or 1.2. But we actually
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.580]   really need to because there's some verification process that goes on. So in all likelihood,
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:22.700]   we will see Gavin Newsom recalled. We agree on that. Yeah, I'll tell you this, the stats I heard,
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:27.440]   there's about a million called a million million one signatures, they've seen about an 85%
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.520]   verification rate today. Saks correct me if I'm wrong on this, they're getting they're getting
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.700]   about 200,000 signatures a week. They're, you know, the cost for marketing and attracting
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.720]   people to get these signatures is coming in at like three to six bucks a signature. So it's
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.640]   really not a lot of money is needed to be spent to get this done. And, you know, even if the
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   verification rate drops to 75 or 65%, you're still on track at this rate,
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:58.520]   to hit the recall target by March 17, which is the deadline. And so it appears highly likely
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.320]   they're going to get there. So am I right on all that? Yeah, I think they're at 1.2 million
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.920]   signatures. That's what I heard. And they're trying to get they're trying to get to 2 million
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:13.400]   to have a buffer so that you know, they that you know, they don't get pushed under the 1.5 is the
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.380]   number they need. Yeah, they need 1.5 million certified signatures 70% of the way there,
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.580]   according to the website, recall Gavin 2020.com, which I think I think I think they will get there.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:28.880]   I think they'll get there and then there and then the recall election would take place about four to
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.640]   five months after. After that, there's a couple of months where it moves through the Finance Committee,
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:41.120]   the recall election has to be budgeted. And then Newsom would have the opportunity to set a date
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:49.760]   within I think 60 to 80 days roughly. So I think we're looking at July for a recall election.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.520]   And sacks, how do you get? How does a candidate
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.460]   get on the ballot because Chamath is asking for a friend?
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:06:02.000]   Wait a second, I want to be on to that. Can should we have all four besties be on?
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.040]   Yeah, we should we should we should all run.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.500]   As we all four. Can we run? We're gonna let the voters decide a squad.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:14.480]   We're gonna we're probably we're probably gonna have four Kardashians on there. So four besties
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.760]   on there. And one extra Kardashian.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.460]   Yeah, so the it's it's it's stunningly easy to be a replacement candidate, we should expect they'll
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:28.880]   probably be about 150 replacement candidates on the ballot every every third tier C-list celebrity
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:34.280]   is gonna, you know, like, you know, back to Gary Coleman did it like, you know, 20 years ago,
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:41.000]   they're all very C-list celebrities. Yeah, to try and boost their Q rating. I'm sure we'll see
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.920]   Kathy Griffin on there. I mean, what she'd been doing. And so it's gonna be a farce.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.520]   Andy Dick is gonna run.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:55.580]   Can we can we just, can we just, can we, by the way, can we talk about why he's getting
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:59.540]   recalled? Because I do get this question a lot from people in tech and out of tech.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.520]   And I just want to highlight some of the reasons I've heard. And I'd love to hear why you guys
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.540]   think he's, you know, why there's this push against him. But from people within the tech
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:14.360]   community, I've heard that the ad hoc lockdown rules have really pissed a lot of people off in
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.900]   terms of when businesses are allowed and not allowed to be open and kind of the responsiveness
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.460]   and the guiding principles around this. And I think that's a really good question. And I think
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:19.940]   that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.540]   good question. And I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:24.680]   Obviously, the you know, the inability to fight against the tax rate, but no one wants to be
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:32.780]   publicly saying that the failed vaccine rollout the failed testing, you know, sacks, Chamath, Jason,
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.920]   what do you guys think is the reason he's getting recalled? What are the top five reasons?
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.720]   hypocrisy is number one. I think it's the hypocrisy of going to those restaurants and then making
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:46.040]   people not go to the beach, which is crazy. And then I think number two is the virus. We've only
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.400]   deployed 37% of our doses in the last five years. And that's a huge number. And I think that's a huge
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.960]   in California. And that makes us you know, of the major states
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.300]   that are putting out a lot of these vaccines. One of the worst
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.940]   performers. Second, yeah. Well, we're Florida, and New York are
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.360]   the other large states and they're at 5649 and 50%. We're
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.660]   still stuck at 37%. California, the cradle of innovation and
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:16.040]   technology, and this bum, he's a bum. 37% we should be leading
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.720]   should be 70%. He's a bum. Can I get
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.160]   a new? It's new some derangement syndrome. Oh my
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.300]   god. No.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:29.060]   besties. Jason just has a problem with anyone in
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.340]   authority. You know, it's the hair. It's a problem.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.640]   Jason fucking hair. It's the hair is too good. French
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.520]   laundry, the hypocrisy and then get to work. So personality,
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.740]   personality for you is the biggest driver. Is that right,
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.600]   Jason? No, it's literally the performance of their
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.020]   watch.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.680]   Washington, DC, West Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota, all
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.480]   66 to 73% of their vaccines are both their double us. Now it's
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.420]   smaller states, but still, we're goddamn California.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:03.240]   Here's what I would say as a list. Number one, we're the most
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.760]   heavily taxed. Number two, we are we have some of the worst
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.940]   infrastructure in the country. We have some of the lowest and
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.700]   poorest performing schools in the country. We have the highest
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.420]   homeless rates for veterans in the country. We have the worst
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:24.160]   preparedness for climate in the country. And so it's basically
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.040]   just a complete bungling at every level. And so and then the
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.580]   fourth or the then the last which is the biggest one is we
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:38.200]   have now created an inhospitable culture for innovation. And the
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.260]   biggest problem with that is if these climate jobs and these
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.860]   technology jobs and these biotechnology jobs pivot to
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:52.280]   more accepting and progressive local and state managements,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.540]   like Austin, Texas and Miami, Florida, we lose these things
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.600]   forever. This is a multi generational decay that we're
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.500]   starting. And so if we care about the state, I love
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.480]   California, I love San Francisco, I love how eclectic and
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:09.380]   unique and different it is, I was always happy to pay 10 1112
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.000]   1314% because it was worth it. Now, I don't know what we get
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.500]   for it.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.600]   And so I think we I think I think he should get recalled. I
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.980]   just think he's he's trash.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:25.040]   Yeah, and just just underscore the point on lockdowns. We now
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.520]   have certainly more cases, we have more deaths. And we have
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.460]   more deaths per capita than Florida. Despite the fact that
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.480]   Florida has no lockdowns and a much older population. And so I
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.420]   was just in Florida a few weeks ago, like,
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.420]   you know, like Jamal was saying, you know, Suarez, the mayor, the
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.480]   mayor there has created really a land of the free. I mean, it's
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.520]   really unbelievable. You can go to bars, you can go to
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.640]   restaurants, there's no lockdown whatsoever. They don't have as
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.500]   big a problem as California does right now.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.760]   Why do you think that is?
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.960]   Because because well, because I think that the scientific basis,
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.600]   yeah, I think the lockdowns only forestalled the problem.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.360]   Eventually, the virus finds a way around them. And I also
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.500]   think the thing that's happening in Florida is that okay, so my
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.440]   aunt lives there. She's in her 70s. She's not going to bars and
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.860]   restaurants because she knows she's highly at risk. And so just
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.180]   because the government doesn't lock down doesn't mean that
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.280]   people don't take sensible precautions on their own. And so
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.340]   and so I think that what's happened is that people are
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.680]   going out to bars and restaurants are low risk. And
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.780]   they're keeping the economy going over there. And instead,
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.480]   in California, we have this very draconian lockdown policy, and
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.780]   it's put all these small businesses out of out of work.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.180]   No, it's worse. It's not a draconian lockdown policy. It's
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.320]   a whipsaw. Oh, it's open. Okay, great. Now go and invest in a
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   bunch of catbacks to make sure that you're safe. And then you're
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   going to have to go to the hospital. And then you're going to
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.420]   have to go to the hospital. And then you're going to have to go to
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.600]   sure there's outdoor dining. Oh, hold on your clothes. What is
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.560]   that? It's just so dumb. Tons of tons of restaurants. bar owners
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.400]   in San Francisco spent on average $30,000 building outdoor
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.920]   seating for their facility only to have it all shut down three
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.920]   and a half weeks later in comment. Can you imagine being
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.480]   an owner of that business? No, it's
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.420]   unfair. No, I mean, you would literally they're going to kill
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.720]   themselves. The tragedy of it. People lose everything and
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.860]   there'll be suicides, depression, domestic violence.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.160]   This guy's and then this guy's having dinner at French
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.100]   Laundry during the whole I mean, it's just such a I just
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.480]   got a note what a bad he will he's he's actually been banished
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.420]   from being at the French Laundry. Apparently, it's been
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.200]   renamed the Sri Lankan laundry and some notable Sri Lankan
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.240]   billionaire has bought the French Laundry. French Laundry,
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.280]   by the way, got a laundry, they got a $2.6 million PPP law that
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.840]   got forgiven. So you know, there's a there's a lot of heat
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.320]   on the French Laundry as a whole. What does it cost to go
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.980]   to French Laundry $800 a person?
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.100]   Anybody who wants who's
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.720]   listening to this who wants to go to the French Laundry, stay
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.100]   at home, pour a bunch of salt on whatever you're gonna eat.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.800]   Okay, melt a stick of butter in the microwave, stick a butter in
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.900]   the microwave, drink it and then basically take $1,500 light it
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.480]   on fire. You've been to the French Laundry. Here's what you
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.840]   do. Take a really great steak trash and throw out 80% of it
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.020]   up places. The cube in the middle of a big large plate.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.380]   That is that's not even nouveau riche. It's just nouveau stupid.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.660]   Oh, I got trash.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.980]   Meanwhile, people are down in like, Texas getting like a brisket
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.940]   burrito for $4.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.160]   But I think California really needs to fix this. We need to
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.380]   figure out what's going on. And I just want to ask one more
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.400]   question of you guys. You don't think that this you know, because
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.100]   I was having this debate with my family about Newsom. And I was
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.020]   telling them about the perspectives I was hearing from
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.080]   tech people, and why everyone's so against Newsom. And I've heard
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.160]   all these different things that you guys have shared today. And,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.260]   you know, they're very, you know, and I'm hearing a lot of
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.640]   people kind of making the counterpoint like, this is a
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.940]   very difficult time. It's been an impossible year for everyone
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.200]   everywhere. So first of all, you know, Newsom was dealt a pretty
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.040]   difficult hand to play. And at the same time, we are all
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.920]   psychologically primed to look for grass being greener on the
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.280]   other side, I think a big part of you know, certainly there's a
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.920]   lot of people leaving California, my belief for Texas
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.880]   and Florida, primarily because of taxes, and then you justify
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.340]   it with all the things that are wrong with California. But we're
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.920]   all really primed right now. With this notion that it's a
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.020]   difficult place to be. But we're also really having a shitty
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.600]   year, we've had this pandemic businesses have been shut, you
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.640]   know, everyone's sick, the economy's having issues. I mean,
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   you know, there's a really difficult hand that's been
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.000]   dealt.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.740]   Well, I don't buy that as an excuse for Newsom. I mean, look,
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.780]   it is true that we're going through a very difficult time.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.940]   But the reason I don't buy that as an excuse for Newsom is
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:38.660]   because this is not April or May of 2020.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.000]   When we thought the fatality rate was 7%. And you know,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.420]   lockdowns could lockdowns could be justified then. But we now
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.260]   have so much more data, we've seen that states that did not do
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.720]   lockdowns, like Florida and Texas, frankly, have been no
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.420]   worse off than those that have done very severe lockdowns. And
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.140]   so what is the point of continuing with this facade? And
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   that is what I think we can legitimately blame Newsom for is
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.920]   the failure to learn and to change course based on data.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.440]   And where is the daily press briefing on the data?
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.980]   Well, I think the data is not 100% accurate. And so I think we
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.300]   have to be very careful about this. We have to be very careful
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.400]   about what we're doing. We have to be very careful about what we're
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.960]   doing. And that's what makes for an idiot. I think, and by the way,
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.440]   most of the spread is not happening at businesses. It's
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440]   happening in homes. And in California, we have a
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.080]   particularly difficult problem, because of multi generational
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.640]   family homes, especially in the Latino communities that have been
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.180]   hardest hit by COVID. And the, the transmission rate and just
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.220]   skew with diabetes as well. But yeah, the transmission rate in
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.220]   those communities is three to five x what it is elsewhere. And
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.580]   then also, suffering the biggest hardships because businesses are
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.120]   closed.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.060]   Well, by the way, this goes to the vaccination strategy just
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.580]   being so idiotic, like, you know, if you wanted to be
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:50.980]   equitable, then why weren't we just rolling through and
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.860]   basically getting those families to be vaccinated first,
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.500]   independent of age, you know, you're you're you're apparently
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.000]   got all these vaccination sites, nobody shows up.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.740]   I spoke to SF DPH, Department of Public Health about this last
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.500]   week, and they told me that they cannot get those communities.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.000]   They're very non trusting of the vaccine.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.880]   And they're having a real struggle getting people to sign
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.680]   up to take the vaccine. The problem is, even if that is the
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.220]   case, the problem is you should not be holding up vaccines for
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:21.440]   one community then get everybody else vaccinated. So they cut the
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.260]   head off this fucking transmission.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.380]   Over 60. Get it. That's it. There's nothing to discuss.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.160]   Let's wrap up everyone. Everyone gets it. But you allocate a
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.060]   certain number of doses to you basically have like a TSA
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.220]   pre check line. If you're over 60, or you're in certain
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.940]   communities, you jump to the front of the line, and that's
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.780]   it. But everyone can stand in line and put fucking vaccines.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.360]   Put fucking shots in arms because everyone I know that's
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.240]   over 65 can't even get an appointment and it's bullshit.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.120]   And the whole thing is incompetence.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.980]   So I think but I think what Zach said is so right. It's like in
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.440]   these moments, J Cal, and freeberg, like a light gets
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.380]   shone on the ability for people to figure things out. And then
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:01.360]   you know what the intellectual capability of these people are.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.540]   And like, look, we saw the intellectual incapability of
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:05.980]   Trump.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.560]   Because we all
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:07.980]   adapt.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:12.360]   This guy could not adapt. Okay. And, and so we are now seeing
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.800]   the intellectual incapability of Gavin Newsom. And I just think
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.020]   they're part of the same lot. They're just kind of, you know,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.220]   people who are in over their head,
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.300]   and they're beholden to people who got them there. And their
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.600]   number one concern is staying in office, which means appeasing a
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.420]   bunch of special interests. Speaking of special interests,
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   David Sachs is still on tilt about conservatives being
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.040]   canceled. David, you wanted us to wrap with this Wilkinson
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.180]   cancellation. So every podcast, we're going to have a right
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.860]   winger who's canceled and David's justification for putting them
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.880]   back on the platform. God, David.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.940]   Well, actually, so yeah, this is this is this is the issue
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.780]   of the week with David. Yes, yes, it's well, this is
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:02.200]   actually it's not a it's not a left wing it. So this is the
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.900]   issue to draw on social media right now is that a writer named
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.240]   Will Wilkinson was just fired from his job and canceled.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.060]   But here's the thing. It was he's not a conservative. He's
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:13.540]   actually a liberal. What? And it was it Yes. And it was a right
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:19.280]   wing tweet mob that got together to get fired. Yes. And so how
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.160]   did you get this mob together to get them canceled?
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.400]   It? Yeah. So we're back everybody so much for the wives
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.760]   dinner. My God. Yeah. I need another wives dinner.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.620]   Well, no, I look I feel the need to speak out on this because I
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.060]   gotta make it really clear that I do not support candidates. I
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.300]   do not support cancel culture when perpetrated by the right
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:44.080]   against the left. I think it's what did he do? Okay, so he
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.260]   posted a tweet making a joke that maybe was important. It's
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:50.920]   not that funny, basically saying that if we want unity, the one
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.500]   thing that like the Trumpers and the Biden supporters can agree
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:58.420]   on is hanging Pence. You know, it is what is hanging?
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:03.700]   lynching. lynching. lynching or hanging? He said he said hang I
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.620]   think no, I think he said I said hang.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   He said, whatever. And it's inciting violence on the march.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.700]   But go ahead, sex. It's in poor taste.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.580]   Well, no, look, it's a it's a it's a joke. That's not actually
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.220]   that funny. And maybe in poor taste. What he's referring to is
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.820]   the fact that the you know that there were people on January six
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.200]   who were going after Mike Pence, right? That was sort of the
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.500]   joke. Anyway, look, he that's not the point. He deleted it. He
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.480]   apologized for it. His boss is still fired him for it. Nobody
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.080]   believes that he was trying to incite violence. Okay. I mean,
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:41.200]   come on. We all know that was not inciting violence. But but
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.880]   the mob pretended that he was in order to create its phony
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:51.340]   outrage. And then his bosses have to pretend that he was in
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.340]   order to get to appease the mob and they pretend like it was
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.460]   incitement to violence so they can fire him. And then he even
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.700]   had to pretend that he was inciting violence because he
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.400]   had to then objectively apologize for it. And there's
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.260]   this that's the thing about cancel culture I really don't
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.520]   like is just it's just so fake.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.580]   And phony. We all have to pretend and things that aren't
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:13.860]   true in order to pacify some you know, tweet mob whose outrage is
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.860]   manufactured anyway. And I don't like seeing the right doing this.
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.460]   And that's what I tweeted about. And then we had all these people
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.080]   on the right responding to me saying an eye for an eye, you
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.360]   know, you know, the left deserves this too. Now they're
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.940]   gonna get a taste of their own medicine. And the problem with
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.580]   that is look, you know, you're you might win this particular
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.120]   battle, but you're losing the war because you're now buying
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.140]   into the premise of cancel culture.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:39.640]   You're not buying into this idea that we need to economically
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.900]   cancel people who disagree with us. And I really reject that.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:48.740]   It's certainly bad timing to say, Lynch or hang, whichever
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:51.040]   word he used, obviously, lynching is a much worse word.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.180]   After people were chanting hang Mike Pence, but he was making a
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.620]   commentary on that. The joke didn't land. And when the joke
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.400]   doesn't land, you need to just take ownership of that and say
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.340]   that you shouldn't be canceled. Just to say it was a poor
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:06.160]   attempt at humor. I apologize. Right. And Jason,
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.660]   you know better than anybody else.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.360]   When a poor joke doesn't land. So
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:15.220]   here's one thing to learn about comedy. People don't remember
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:18.060]   the jokes that don't land. They remember the ones that land.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.100]   Okay, everybody. It's like investing in startups. It's like
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.260]   it you got a lot of losers to find the few winners.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.680]   Absolutely. That's my I'm a volume guy. You know that
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.260]   governor Chamath calm governor sacks.com Governor freeberg.com

[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.980]   recalled, I would like to put my name on the ballot. And

[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.200]   and I'm going to give everybody a school voucher. Okay, we have
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.820]   it. Maybe, maybe on the next episode, we can all declare that
