[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Happy Friday, listeners.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.520]   We are joined again by Matt Chandler,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   the lead pastor at the Village Church
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.640]   and the author of the new book, The Mingling of Souls,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.520]   God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   He joins us by phone from Dallas.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.760]   And Matt, I've got 10 questions
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.380]   on relationships queued up for you.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680]   Here's number eight in our list.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.440]   If a man or a woman is trying to stop
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.880]   looking at pornography, but he cannot,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.360]   and many Christian men struggle here,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.000]   are they ready to date or not?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.140]   And if not, what is the line between being ready
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.960]   and not ready to date for a Christian porn addict?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920]   - Yeah, so this is an extremely, I think,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.400]   complex question that's hard to answer
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.280]   outside of actually knowing the people involved.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.940]   So my knee-jerk reaction is, no, you're not ready,
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.380]   let's get this handled.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.760]   But I think what I would wanna do is sit down
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.400]   and I would wanna know what's going on.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.080]   Where's mortification happening?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.040]   Where's vivification happening?
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.360]   What do we mean when we say porn addict?
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.520]   I mean, are we saying that this guy or this girl
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.080]   once a year stumbles into, or are we saying
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.080]   this is every couple of times a month is,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.320]   where are we in relation to frequency, healing, victory?
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.960]   And I think all of those would come into play
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.560]   on whether or not I would encourage someone
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   to be in a relationship while they wrestled.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.320]   The truth is, all of us, every one of us,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.480]   are coming into our relationship with the opposite sex
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.440]   needing further sanctification, needing growth,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.760]   needing to grow in our identity,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.840]   needing our identity in Christ,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.260]   needing to have parts of our flesh mortified.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.880]   And so this one's just gonna affect the relationship
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.220]   in deeper ways in regards to being able to,
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.220]   I've read almost everything I could on the horrific issues
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.360]   that porn addiction brings about in a guy's or a girl's
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.920]   ability to even be emotionally connected to people.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.560]   And so that's why I mean, I would kinda wanna get
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800]   to the bottom of who we're talking to here.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   I mean, when we're saying addict, what do we mean by that?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.440]   And so without kind of that information,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.200]   it becomes hard to just lay a hard answer down.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   But I don't know that I would say absolutely not
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.560]   until this is not an issue for you anymore,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.240]   or until you don't, but at the same time,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.600]   if this is a serious, several times a month,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.340]   you're giving yourself over to this,
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.440]   you're actively seeking it out,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   then man, I don't think you have any business dating.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   - Sobering but wise, thank you, Matt.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.480]   And that leads us into question number nine.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.280]   Are there any other circumstances in which you as a pastor
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.800]   would tell someone that they are just simply not ready
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760]   to pursue a dating relationship?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.840]   And what are some of the indications that would signal
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.760]   to you that a person is simply not ready
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.980]   to pursue dating right now?
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.400]   - So when I'm telling someone,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.160]   or leveraging my relationship with someone
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.040]   in regards to dating or not dating,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.240]   I'm always doing that within the covenant
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.000]   of me being their pastor and them being a covenant member
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.240]   of the church.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.820]   So our relationship from the beginning is one
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.960]   that's not just me having a cursory view of their life,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.560]   but hopefully me knowing where they are.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.280]   And so I have oftentimes recommended someone hold off
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.460]   until dating, until the season that they were in
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.120]   with the Lord has changed.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   And so I told a man last year, a young man last year,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   that where he was in his relationship with the Lord,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.440]   I would hold off pursuing a girlfriend
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.700]   until he had given himself back over to growing
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.160]   in this relationship with the Lord.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.880]   It wasn't just that he was in the desert or just stagnant,
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.660]   but that he had really, I believe, was walking in sin
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.420]   and hadn't grown stagnant,
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.900]   but had stopped altogether pursuing his relationship
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.740]   with the Lord.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.540]   So wasn't in the word, wasn't praying,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.540]   had become kind of hit or miss in the gathering,
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.060]   hit or miss in his home group.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.620]   He had guys pursuing him that he was avoiding.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.920]   He had had relational conflict with some guys
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.260]   that he was refusing to kind of connect with them
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.420]   and reconcile.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.520]   And so I had just recommended to him
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.540]   that this would be a really foolish time
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.400]   and a time that I thought would end
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.340]   in either his heart being broken
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.620]   or some poor girl at our churches being heartbroken.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.580]   And even didn't threaten,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.740]   but said that I would probably engage the girl he pursued
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.580]   to tell her that I didn't think this was wise
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.140]   for where he was at the season.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.340]   - That's tough love,
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.860]   but certainly a category we need to be thinking through.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.080]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.700]   We're gonna take a break for the weekend now.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.120]   On Monday, we'll return with Matt once again,
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.060]   because the statistics are staggering
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.420]   when you look at the number of young men and young women
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.800]   in churches who are victims of past sexual abuse.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.620]   So what does this abuse do to their dating relationship?
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.020]   What type of baggage will this bring into courtship
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.100]   and into marriage?
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.480]   And how should couples talk through it?
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.980]   This is an important issue,
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.620]   and it's one that hits close to home for Matt,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.940]   and we will address it on Monday.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.540]   Thanks for listening to the Aspester John podcast.
