[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   God loves to work for those who wait for him.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   So how do we wait for God? Does waiting for God mean that we don't act?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And when do we stop waiting and start acting?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Those are really important questions and they were addressed in Pastor John's sermon on Isaiah 64, verses 1-4.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   In a sermon he preached way back in 1982.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   In one sense God works for everybody.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   He makes that sun rise on the just and the unjust.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   He sends rain on the good and the evil.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   He brings seed time and harvest even for his rebellious creatures.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   God does work for all his creatures and all of this is meant to lead us to repentance.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   But in our text the work referred to is not that common grace given to all,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   but a special grace that is given to those who have a certain disposition.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   No eye has seen a God besides thee who works for those who wait, who wait for him.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The work mentioned here clearly is not just the work of creation and preservation.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's not just the meeting of a few natural needs that he does for everybody.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Rather it's the investment of all God's infinite sovereign power
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   to do everything his people need to have done for their good.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And for whom does he do it? He does it for those who wait for him.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So the biggest question for us right now is, "What's that? How do you do that?"
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I want to try to show you from Isaiah how you wait for the Lord.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   The people to whom Isaiah is talking are in trouble.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   They're in danger from enemies.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Assyrians once, then Babylonians.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Now, the danger that God sees is not so much the Assyrians and the Babylonians,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   but the temptation to run to Egypt for help instead of to God.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Instead of waiting for God's help,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   he sees the temptation looming large that they're going to go after human help.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And so he says in Isaiah 31.1,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   who trust in chariots because they are many,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   or in horsemen because they are very strong,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult the Lord."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So the first thing that waiting on God means is,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   before you make one peep of an effort to solve your own problem
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   or hire a human agency, pray.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Seek the counsel of God.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   What is His way to solve this problem and bring you out of trouble?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It says in Psalm 106.13,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "They soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The first act of waiting, therefore, is prayer.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Before we make one little move to solve our problem.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And I know if you're like me, you've come through many efforts.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And an hour into it, you say, "I forgot to pray."
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And we need to work to form the habit of stopping again and again and again.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   That's what Paul means, I think, when he says, "Pray without ceasing."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Before you do anything, at every little occasion of your life,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   every interview, every encounter, whisper a prayer,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   "How would it go if I relied on you? What do you want me to do?"
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And then, do what the Lord says.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   We are like patients.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Prayer is like getting on the phone and calling up your doctor and saying,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   "I'm in trouble. There's this pain. What should I do about it?"
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Before you gulp down any medicine or start doing jumping jacks,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   call the doctor.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Now, the doctor might tell you, "Lie down. Don't do anything."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Or he might tell you, "Take the pill. Do your exercises."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Now, those two instructions from the Lord involve us in two different forms of waiting.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   We don't stop waiting once we've called. We wait.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   There is a waiting of two different sorts.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Let's look at them just one at a time here.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The first one is if the doctor says, "Lie down."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Isaiah 30 verse 15 goes like this.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   God says to the people, "In returning and rest you shall be saved.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   In quietness and in trust shall be your strength.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But you would not. You said, 'No, we will speed upon horses.'
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And therefore you shall speed away.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And you said, 'We will ride upon swift steeds.'
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And therefore your pursuers shall be swift."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   In other words, God was saying on the phone, "Just sit down and I'm going to work for you.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Take it easy and rest and I'll be your strength."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But they wouldn't do it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   They wanted to maneuver their own victory for their own glory on horses and chariots.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Sometimes we have to be willing on the phone to accept the frustrating news, "Be still."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We need to hear what Moses said to the people as they were about to cross the Red Sea,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "Fear not. Stand firm and behold the salvation of the Lord which He will work for you today.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   The Lord will fight for you. You have only to be still."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So the second thing that waiting for the Lord means is after you've prayed to the doctor
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and he says, "Be still," be still and rest.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But there's a third way to wait for the Lord.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And that is, he might say, "Get up. Do your exercises and take your pill."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Or to bring it back into the Old Testament context, he might say, "Go into battle and fight."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   In my family, we've been reading 2 Samuel for devotions in the morning.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And just a few days ago, we read 2 Samuel 5.19.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Now the situation is that David has just taken over after Saul's death and the Philistines are besieging.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And here's what he does.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "David inquired of the Lord." He waited.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into my hand?"
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "Wait. Answer."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   "And the Lord said to David, 'Go up, for I shall surely give them into your hands.'"
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So the word to David was not, "Lie still." The word to David was, "Fight."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   He didn't take matters into his own hands. He waited.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   But now here is the essence. Now get this carefully.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Because we're so prone to think that waiting means stillness,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   but as soon as we start acting, preparing a sermon, a lesson, going to work, preparing a report, staying up late, work, work, work,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   we don't have to wait anymore.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's not the case.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Because, and this changes all of life, there is a spirit of waiting in the midst of work.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Proverbs 21, 31 says this, "The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You see the implication of that for the warrior?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It means that when the Lord says, "Go," he doesn't stop waiting.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He carries with him into battle a spirit of expectancy,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   a sense that, "Yes, I will fight with all my might, but I must wait on the one in whose hands alone is the victory."
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So that no matter how hard you work, there's a spirit of waiting, a spirit of expectancy,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   a spirit that out of and through all this activity is going to come lightning from heaven to do supernatural work.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Here's the way the psalmist put it in Psalm 33, 16, "A king is not saved by his great army.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   A warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   The war horse is a vain hope for victory, and by its great might it cannot save.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Our soul waits for the Lord.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   He is our help and our shield.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yea, our heart is glad in him because we trust in his holy name.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Let thy steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us even as we hope in thee."
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   If the Lord instructs us to take certain precautions, like locking the door at night,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   don't think that you can stop waiting on the Lord.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   For the psalm says, Psalm 127, 1, "Unless the Lord watches over the city, those who stay awake, stay awake in vain."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Even when we are watchmen doing our duty, we must be waiting for the Lord, for he alone brings safety.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   So the third form of waiting is even when the Lord says, "Act," we act with a spirit of reliance on his work,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and we wait for the Lord in a spirit of expectancy that even though our labor is vulnerable and paltry,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   the final result of all we do lies in the hands of the Lord, and on that we wait in all our work.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So, in conclusion, those three things, let me sum them up again.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   When circumstances conspire to put you under pressure so that you feel something's got to be done,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   something's got to be done for safety, or something's got to be done for service, wait for the Lord.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   That is, pray. Before you do anything else, seek the Lord. Seek his counsel.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   What would he have you do, if anything? Second, if the Lord says, "Sit down and put your feet up."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   If the Lord says, "Don't go to church tonight to be at the council meeting. Stay home and pray.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I will work better than your arguments. Stay home."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And if the Lord says, "Go and argue with all your might," don't become self-reliant, but go.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And let me stress in regard to that second point that I don't mean laziness or the shirking of duty.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I mean the very frustrating experience that sometimes when you're most prepared,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   when you think most relies on you and your zeal is fired, the Lord may say to you,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   "You just stay home tonight and watch me work."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And you're a little frustrated because you had it all planned. But he wants to work for you
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   so that he gets the glory and not us.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   So, whether we lie still and sit or whether we work, let us have this in common,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   that we wait for the Lord, that we have a spirit of expectancy, that no matter how paltry our labors are,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   the final issue is in the hands of the Lord and he loves to work for those who wait for him.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So good. That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon on September 5th, 1982,
