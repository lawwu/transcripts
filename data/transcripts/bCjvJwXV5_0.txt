[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.960]   Well, it seems the Apostle Paul traveled about 15,500 miles in his ministry, and around 8,700
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.800]   of those miles were on foot. These are the calculations of New Testament scholar Eckhart
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.560]   Schnabel, and that's an incredible range for the first century. We can trace out his missionary
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   plot points on Google Maps. In fact, it's already been done. But what can we learn from
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   those trips for our own missionary work today? It's a question from Chi Hong, a listener.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.960]   "Pastor John, hello from Malaysia. What can we learn about Paul's missionary journeys?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.640]   Can we say he strategized his movements based on his accessibility? Sometimes, of course,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   he was prohibited by the Holy Spirit to go certain places. I'm wondering about this question
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.200]   for myself and also to guide potential missionaries on how we choose where we go. What do we learn
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   about Paul's missional strategies from his geographical movements?"
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:11.040]   I don't think that the way Paul acted geographically and with regard to cities, say, is per se
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   mandatory for the Church today. In other words, descriptive activities in the Book of Acts
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:27.420]   may or may not be normative for us, depending on whether Luke, the inspired writer, gives
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.360]   clues that the description he's giving is intended by him to be authoritative for later
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.320]   generations. And I don't think that's usually the case. However, just like we would be foolish
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   in reading biography not to learn from the strategies of the best missionaries, we would
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.760]   be idiotic not to pay close attention to Paul and his strategies, because he was one of
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.720]   the greatest missionaries of all. So let me mention three of his strategies, and then
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.800]   we can work together on whether these have a direct impact on us or not, or how they
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   do.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.020]   First, on Paul's first missionary journey described in Acts 13 and 14, three things
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.840]   marked his geographic strategy. One, he went to cities—Salamis, Perga, Antioch, Pisidia,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.880]   Iconium, Lystra. Second, he usually focused on the synagogue first in those towns. Third,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.640]   he backtracked, revisited the same towns on his way home, discipling people, telling them
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.820]   they're going to be afflicted, and appointing elders in all the churches. So we should give
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.900]   serious consideration to the wisdom of focusing on population centers that may have some kind
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.100]   of religious expression—for him it was synagogue—some kind of religious expression which might provide
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:04.060]   a redemptive analogy, a link to make the gospel more readily understandable. But I don't
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.600]   say this as an absolute, because we don't know whether Paul did serious evangelizing
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.960]   in the smaller villages between these towns. We still know. There's nothing in the book
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.800]   of Acts that says Luke's narrative is exhaustive. We know it's not. You can read it in an
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:33.100]   hour and it covers years. And so I would never want anyone to think that the only biblical
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.060]   mandated way to do frontier missions is to go to cities. That may be wise, but there
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.260]   are other factors that might, in a certain situation, say, "No, that's not the best
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.780]   strategy." Here's number two, number two strategy that we can look at. We notice that
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.620]   Paul sometimes spent an extended period of time in one of those urban centers, with the
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.460]   effect that the gospel spread to the entire region, evidently because people come and
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.620]   go. There are communication and transportation lines between that urban center and the outlying
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:20.220]   areas and villages. So listen to Acts 19, 8-10, as Paul describes his first longer stay
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.940]   in Ephesus. "Paul entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.340]   and persuading them about the kingdom of God. But when some became stubborn and continued
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.940]   in unbelief, speaking evil of the way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.060]   took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. This continued for
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.460]   two years, so that"—no, what's that word "so that"? "So that all the residents
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.820]   of Asia"—that's the province—"heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks."
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.260]   So that little phrase "so that" shows that the effect of Paul's lingering for
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.860]   two years in one single urban center resulted in the whole region hearing the word of the
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.100]   Lord, instead of Paul jumping around to all those villages. So we should seriously consider
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.660]   whether one effective strategy for reaching a region that may have lines of transportation
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.700]   and communication to an urban center, whether focusing on that center might be more strategic
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.780]   than focusing, say, on one of the outlying villages. So that's my second observation
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   that we could learn from. Here's the last one, and probably most important, I think,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.260]   for the task remaining for us, namely Paul's amazing testimony, astonishing, in Romans
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.820]   15, 18-24. "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.620]   through me, so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum"—so that would
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:16.180]   be, picture Jerusalem down in southern Palestine and Albania, northern Italy—"from Jerusalem
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:24.060]   all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ, and
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.580]   thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel not where Christ has already been named, lest
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.420]   I build on someone else's foundation. This is the reason why I have so often been hindered
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.180]   in coming to you, you people in Rome, because I've been trying to plant the gospel in
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.300]   all these unreached regions so I can get out of here and let the evangelists finish the
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.820]   work. But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions"—this is
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.280]   astonishing that he would say that! "No longer have any room for work in these regions,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.140]   and since I have longed for many years to come to you, I hope to see you in passing
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:09.220]   as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you once I have enjoyed your company
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.940]   for a while." So here are my five concluding brief observations from that text. One, his
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:24.540]   ambition and strategy to preach the gospel not where Christ has already been named. Number
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.660]   two, with that definition of your ministry, a region can be completed. You can think in
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.020]   terms of closure and completion, if that's the definition of your ministry. The gospel
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.180]   can be, as he said, fulfilled, even though lots of people are left to be evangelized.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.100]   They're not all saved, but local pastors like Timothy, being left behind at Ephesus,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.860]   can get the job done with evangelism. Paul's finished, he's out of there because his
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:01.000]   job is put the gospel where it's never been heard. Number three, not everybody in missions
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.460]   is called to have this kind of assignment, to preach where Christ has not been named.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:12.260]   Timothy was taken from Lystra, his hometown, and planted in Ephesus, so he was a kind of
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:18.340]   missionary. He crossed geography, maybe some cultural differences, no doubt, and Paul left
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.860]   him there. Now you get the job done in these wider regions around here as a pastor there
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.220]   in Ephesus. I'm going to Spain, because that's my calling. Number four, Paul sought
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:36.940]   help from the churches to support him in his mission to Spain. So it's not only a missionary
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.280]   who feels responsible for going where Christ's name has not been named, but churches feel
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.380]   it and get behind him. Nobody should feel guilty in Rome that they didn't go with him,
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.060]   he didn't invite them. It's not their job. You stay there and evangelize Rome and send
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.880]   me whatever money you can, because I'm going to go where the gospel's never been preached.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:03.860]   Number five, last one. So today, I think it is very likely that God wills for there to
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.340]   be at least three kinds of missionary types, or maybe two kinds and a subcategory under
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:16.140]   number two. One is a Paul-type missionary, always pressing to the frontiers where there's
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.300]   no church, no gospel witness at all. Frontier missionary types. May God raise up more and
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.820]   more and more of them in our day. Second, the Timothy-type missionary who leaves one
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:33.620]   place, goes to another place. This would be like maybe going to Dubai and being a pastor.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.320]   I've got several friends who've done that. That's a Timothy-type missionary, I would
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:47.500]   say. And third would be all those people who evidently went out from the church in Ephesus
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.220]   and shared the gospel all over Asia, so that Paul could say, when he'd spent two years
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.860]   in Asia, "The word of the Lord has been heard all over Asia." Well, he didn't take it. Timothy
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:04.740]   didn't take it. This is just average Christians moving around in the world along communication
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:11.660]   and we would say internet lines and transportation lines where you can go, and they're taking
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:19.640]   the gospel everywhere they go. So those would be at least three pointers from Paul's missionary
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:27.300]   strategies that would inform ours today, I think. But we should be sensitive to the Holy
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:35.320]   Spirit's leading for whatever new thing God may want to put on our hearts today for finishing
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.420]   the Great Commission and not feel restricted, "Whoa, I didn't see Paul do that, so maybe
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.020]   I shouldn't do it." I don't think there's any hint in the Bible that we should limit
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.620]   our strategies to the ones Paul used.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.620]   Fascinating takeaways, even in the discontinuities. Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for making
