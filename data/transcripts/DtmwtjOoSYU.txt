[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.960]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.760]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.720]   Dr. Robert Sapolsky.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800]   Dr. Sapolsky is a professor of biology and neurosurgery
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.680]   at Stanford University.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.980]   His laboratory has worked on a large variety of topics,
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.560]   including stress, hormones, including testosterone
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.160]   and estrogen, and how the different members
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.840]   of a given species interact according to factors
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.440]   like hormones, hierarchy within primate troops,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.080]   and how things like stress, reproduction,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.380]   and competition impact behavior.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.480]   One of the things that makes Dr. Sapolsky's work so unique
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   is that it combines elements from primatology,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.480]   including field studies, with human behavior,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.640]   in essence, trying to unveil how humans
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.280]   as old world primates are controlled by different elements
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.880]   of our biology, as well as our psychology.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.840]   Dr. Sapolsky is also a prolific author of popular books,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.980]   such as "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,"
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.680]   "The Trouble with Testosterone,"
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.440]   and "Behave the Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst."
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.280]   During the course of our discussion today,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.120]   Robert also revealed to me that he is close
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   to completing a new book entitled
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.960]   "Determined, the Science of Life Without Free Will."
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200]   And indeed, we discuss the science of life
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.820]   without free will during this episode.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.320]   We also discuss stress and how best to control stress
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.280]   and how stress controls us
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060]   at both conscious and subconscious levels.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.560]   We talk about testosterone and estrogen
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.520]   and hormone replacement therapy
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.320]   and how those impact our mind, our psychology,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520]   and our interactions with others.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700]   As with any discussion with Dr. Sapolsky,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.480]   we learn about scientific mechanisms
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.040]   that make us who we are.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.880]   And today we also discuss tools
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.300]   and how we can leverage those scientific mechanisms
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.360]   in order to be better versions of ourselves.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.520]   I should mention that unlike most guest interviews
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.540]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.240]   this one had to be carried out remotely
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.600]   due to various constraints.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.660]   So you may hear the occasional audio artifact.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.620]   Please excuse that.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.920]   We felt that the value of a conversation with Dr. Sapolsky
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.340]   was well worth those minor, minor glitches.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880]   And indeed, the information that he delivers us
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   is tremendously valuable, interesting,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.840]   and in many cases, actionable as well.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.400]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.420]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.340]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.200]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.320]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.200]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.100]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.560]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.960]   from Stanford, and everything about the design
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.740]   of the sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.380]   was created with performance in mind.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.720]   There are several things I like about Roca glasses so much.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440]   One of them is that the aesthetic of the glasses is great.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.100]   Unlike a lot of performance glasses out there
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.820]   that you can wear while swimming and running,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.920]   but also indoors,
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.860]   these glasses don't make you look like a cyborg.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.360]   The aesthetic of them is really terrific,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760]   and they have a lot of different styles to select from.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.720]   In addition to that, the quality of the lenses
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.820]   on both the sunglasses and eyeglasses are superb.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.240]   The optical clarity is great.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.700]   You can move from brightly lit areas to shadowed areas,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.240]   and you don't get any degradation
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.700]   in the quality of the visual image,
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.040]   and that's absolutely essential.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.720]   you can go to roca.com and enter the code Huberman

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.560]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.020]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.580]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.460]   to help you better understand your body
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.560]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.540]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.980]   and now with the advent of quality DNA tests,
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.480]   you can get a lot of information about your genetics
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.900]   and how that also impacts your immediate
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.300]   and long-term health.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.500]   The reason I'm such a fan of getting blood work done
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.180]   is that it is really the only way
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.420]   to understand what's going on in your system
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.000]   at a level that can really inform your decisions
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.620]   about your immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.300]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.580]   is that you get numbers back about your hormones
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.120]   and your metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.260]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.600]   With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.000]   that gives you that information
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.580]   and then gives you some suggestions and directives
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.880]   about things you could change about your nutrition,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.060]   about your exercise and other lifestyle factors
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.500]   that can help you move those numbers in the direction
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.820]   that's best for you and for your health.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.280]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.540]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.020]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.700]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.580]   that raises organic grass-fed
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.300]   and finished certified humane meats.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.940]   I eat meat about once a day.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.060]   In general, my lunch or my breakfast consists of some meat
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.820]   and that meat has to be a very high quality
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820]   and generally I'll eat some vegetable as well.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.840]   And then I tend to eat pastas and rice
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.420]   and things of that sort later in the day or in the evening
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.920]   in order to facilitate the transition to sleep.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.980]   So I'm eating meat about once a day
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.500]   and I always insist that the meat that I eat
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.020]   be of the very highest quality
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.460]   and that the animals were raised and maintained humanely.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.340]   While conventionally raised animals are confined
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.140]   to feed lots and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.460]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.480]   and seasonal grasses resulting in meat
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.180]   that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.660]   In addition, they raise their animals
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.740]   in a way that's not just better for our health,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.540]   but also has a positive impact on the environment.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.180]   They practice regenerative agriculture,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.300]   which means the meat is climate positive
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.520]   and carbon negative.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.060]   So you can feel good about what you're eating
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.140]   at the environmental level and for sake of your health.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.320]   You can order Belcampo's sustainably raised meats
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.780]   to be delivered to you by using my code Huberman
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.700]   at belcampo.com/huberman and entering my code Huberman
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.940]   to get 20% off your first time order.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.820]   I'm partial to the ribeyes or the New York steaks.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.240]   So on one day I might have a ribeye,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.740]   the next day I might have a New York steak.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.420]   I also really like the meatballs.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.340]   I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.680]   So again, that's belcampo.com/huberman
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.940]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.060]   to get 20% off your order.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.260]   And now without further ado,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.380]   my conversation with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.940]   Great, well, thank you so much, Robert,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.000]   for joining us today.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.020]   I've been looking forward to this for a very long time.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.860]   I appreciate it.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.500]   - Glad to be here.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.200]   There's an enormous range of topics
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.340]   that we could drill into,
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.940]   but just to start off,
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.140]   I want to return to a topic that is near and dear
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.340]   to your heart, which is stress.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.180]   And one of the questions that I get most commonly is,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.700]   what is the difference between short and long-term stress
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.140]   in terms of their benefits and their drawbacks?
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.720]   And the reason I say benefits is that obviously stress
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.660]   and the stress response can keep us alive,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.460]   but stress of course can also sharpen our mental acuity
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.820]   and things of that sort.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.600]   So how should we conceptualize stress
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.040]   and how should we conceptualize stress
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.520]   in the short-term and in the long-term?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   - Well, basically sort of two graphs that one would draw.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.620]   The first one is just all sorts of beneficial effects
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.940]   of stress short-term.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.660]   And then once we get into the chronicity,
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.540]   it's just downhill from there.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.140]   Short-term because it saves you from the predator.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.980]   Short-term because you're giving a presentation
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.220]   and you think more clearly or your focus is better,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.920]   all sorts of aspects of that.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.540]   And what then winds up being an argument
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.360]   is how long does it take to go from short-term to long-term?
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.240]   And that's somewhat arbitrary,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.980]   but the sorts of chronic stressors
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.780]   that most people deal with
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.200]   are just undeniably in the chronic range,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.300]   like having spent the last 20 years,
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.160]   daily traffic jams or abusive boss or some such thing.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.660]   The other curve that's sort of perpendicular to this
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.760]   is dealing with the fact
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.400]   that sometimes stress is a great thing.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   Like our goal is not to cure people of stress
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.960]   because if it's the right kind, we love it.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.460]   We pay good money to be stressed that way
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.980]   by a scary movie or rollercoaster ride.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.920]   What you wind up seeing is
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.300]   when it's the right amount of stress,
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.620]   it's what we call stimulation.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.900]   And the basic curve there is
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.820]   here's an optimal level of stimulation and too little,
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.100]   and function goes down with what we would call boredom,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.120]   and too much and function goes down
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.100]   with what we would call stress.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.900]   And the optimum is what all of us aim for.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.820]   - In terms of the benefits of stress in the short term,
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.860]   one thing that's really striking to me is
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.320]   how physiologically the stress response
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.100]   looks so much like the excitement response
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.400]   to a positive event.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.460]   And we can speculate that the fundamental difference
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.220]   between short-term stress and short-term excitement
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.940]   is some neuromodulator like dopamine or something like that.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.340]   But is there anything else that we know about the biology
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.020]   that reveals to us what really creates
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.260]   this thing we call valence,
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.680]   that an experience can be terrible or feel awful,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   or it can feel wonderful, exhilarating,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.340]   depending on this somewhat subjective feature
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.020]   we call valence.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.200]   Do we know what valence is or where it resides?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.220]   - On a really mechanical level,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.700]   if you're in a circumstance that is requiring
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.020]   that your heart races and you're breathing as fast
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.620]   and you're using your muscles and some such thing,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.740]   you're going to be having roughly
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.780]   the same brain activation profile,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.420]   whether this is for something wonderful
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.820]   or something terrible,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.220]   with the one exception being that if the amygdala
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.460]   is part of the activation,
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.300]   this is something that's going to be counting as adverse.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.420]   Whether that's the circumstance, an adverse circumstance,
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.540]   recruiting the amygdala into it
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.700]   and how much it's the amygdala being involved
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.820]   biases you towards interpreting it as even more awful.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.180]   The amygdala in some ways is kind of the checkpoint
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.100]   as to whether we're talking about excitement
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.420]   or terror.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.140]   - Let's use the amygdala as a transition point
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.500]   to another topic that you've spent many years working on
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.620]   and thinking about,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.260]   which is testosterone and other sex steroid hormones.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.600]   I heard you say once before that
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.980]   among all the brain areas that bind testosterone,
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.220]   that where testosterone can park and create effects,
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.220]   that the amygdala is among the most chock-a-block full
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.060]   of these parking spots, these receptors.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.180]   I realize there's a lot here,
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.700]   but how should we think about the role of testosterone
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.240]   in the amygdala given that the engagement of the amygdala
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.420]   is fundamental in this transition point
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.260]   between a exhilarating positive response
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.020]   and a negative stressful response?
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.500]   Or maybe just broadly,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.220]   how should we think about testosterone
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.660]   and its effects on the brain?
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.260]   - And pertinent to the transition
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.220]   from whether this is a stressor that's evoking fear
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.380]   or evoking aggression in terms of that continuum also,
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.460]   'cause the amygdala is in the center
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.460]   of all four points on those axes.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.540]   Basically, almost everybody out there
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.140]   has a completely wrong idea as to what testosterone does,
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.900]   which is testosterone makes you aggressive
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.780]   because males, virtually every species out there,
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.260]   have more testosterone and are more aggressive,
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.380]   and seasonal maters have testosterone
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.020]   surging at the time of year.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.060]   They're punching it out over territory.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.200]   And you take testosterone out of the picture.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.060]   You castrate any mammal out there, including us,
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.860]   and levels of aggression will go down.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.740]   And the easy thing then is to conclude
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.900]   that testosterone causes aggression.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.280]   And the reality is testosterone does no such thing.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.180]   It doesn't cause aggression.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.640]   And you can see this both behaviorally and in the amygdala.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.940]   What does testosterone do?
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.440]   It lowers the threshold for the sort of things
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.620]   that would normally provoke you into being aggressive
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.040]   so that it happens more easily.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.220]   It makes systems that are already turned on
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.580]   turn on louder rather than turning on aggressive music
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.620]   or some such thing.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.240]   What does that look like behaviorally?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.480]   You take five male monkeys, put them together.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.060]   They form a dominance hierarchy.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.260]   Number one is great.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.700]   Number five is miserable.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.220]   Number three is right in between.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.340]   Now take number three and shoot the guy up
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.920]   with tons of testosterone,
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.020]   and he's going to be involved in more fights.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.740]   Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.660]   But you look closely and there's a pattern to it.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.260]   Is number three now challenging numbers two and one
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.780]   for their place in the hierarchy?
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.820]   Absolutely not.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.540]   He is brown nosing them exactly as much as he used to.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.700]   What's going on is he's just a miserable terror
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.220]   to poor number four and five.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.760]   And in that case, what testosterone is doing
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.560]   is amplifying the preexisting patterns of aggression,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.900]   amplifying the social learning that's already gone into it.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.780]   Now on sort of the more reductive level,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.440]   so how does that translate into the amygdala?
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.840]   Does testosterone make amygdaloid neurons
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.900]   have action potentials?
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.320]   Does it cause those neurons to suddenly speak
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.040]   about fear and aggression spontaneously?
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.540]   Absolutely not.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.540]   What they do is if the amygdala is already being stimulated,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.400]   it increases the rate of neuronal firing.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.620]   What it's worth, it shortens after hyperpolarizations.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.260]   So the theme there exactly is it's not creating aggression,
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.900]   it's just upping the volume
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.660]   of whatever aggression is already there.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.860]   And once you factor that in,
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.940]   it's impossible to say anything about what testosterone does
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.940]   outside the context of what testosterone-related behaviors,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.260]   how they get treated in your social settings.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.840]   - Yeah, and in terms of status
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   and the relationship between individuals,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   either non-human primates or humans,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.820]   can we say that testosterone and levels of testosterone,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.420]   or I should say, can we say that relative levels
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.620]   of testosterone between individuals
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.980]   is correlated to status within the hierarchy?
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.600]   - Yes, but in a way that winds up
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.020]   being totally uninteresting.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.480]   Like you go back, I don't know,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.620]   whatever number of decades to endocrinology texts,
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.540]   and there were two totally reliable findings in there.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.740]   Let's see, I have a dog in here that's so good.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.500]   - Oh good, we like dogs at the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.460]   - Okay, he's jingling a bit.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.180]   - They are welcome, they are absolutely welcome, yeah.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.900]   And there'd be two truisms,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.220]   which is higher levels of testosterone
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.680]   predict higher levels of aggression
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.300]   in humans and other animals.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.460]   Higher levels of testosterone
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.580]   predict higher levels of sexual activity.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.420]   Whoa, testosterone causing both.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.340]   And the correlation is there.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.780]   And when you look closely, we've got cause and effect stuff.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.380]   Sexual behavior raises testosterone levels.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.400]   Aggression raises testosterone levels.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.300]   Your levels beforehand are barely predictive
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.820]   of what's gonna happen.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.140]   So it's a response rather than a cause.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.840]   When you look at that though,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.820]   in terms of making sense of individual differences,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.700]   they don't matter a whole lot.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.140]   You can like spend an entire career
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.060]   on the social circumstances that produced
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.700]   three and a half percent more testosterone in the circulation
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.020]   and expect to see all sorts of interesting implications.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.240]   And that's not really the case.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.980]   It's somewhat of a yes or no modulator
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.200]   of a much more subtle social stuff that's already there.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.580]   - Very interesting.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.660]   You know, I think that there are a lot of misconceptions
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.340]   about human biology, but testosterone seems to be one area
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.420]   where at least from what I can find on the internet,
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.960]   there's a sort of at the peak of misunderstanding.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.520]   Maybe we could just ask a few more questions
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.320]   about testosterone and sexual behavior,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.720]   because there's an interesting story there
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.980]   about castration versus non-castration
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.260]   and the causality again.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.360]   But before you address that,
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.140]   I just want to highlight something that you said
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.900]   that I think is so vital, which is that behaviors
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.380]   such as aggressive behaviors and sexual behaviors
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.260]   can actually increase testosterone.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.820]   Did I hear that correctly?
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.820]   And the reverse is sort of true, but not in a causal way.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.460]   Is that right?
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.300]   - The opposite direction with the causality, yeah.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.020]   - Yeah, so if I were to increase somebody's testosterone
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.180]   by 30% male or female, doesn't matter,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.740]   their sexual behavior may or may not change.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.240]   - Essentially zero effect at all.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.600]   Your brain is not that sensitive to fluctuations
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.360]   in testosterone levels.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.120]   In terms of things like aggression,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.260]   raising testosterone just is a great footnote.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.200]   If you have the right type of willing to die
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.680]   in the trenches devotion sort of thing,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.720]   watching your favorite team play a sport
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.000]   will raise your testosterone levels
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.920]   as you sit there with a potato chips in your arm chair.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.540]   So it's not the physicality of aggression,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.780]   it's the psychological framing of it.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.440]   So yeah, testosterone is not causing that.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.840]   And a great way to appreciate that is,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.560]   okay, so you had all these
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.360]   testosterone sexual behavior correlations
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.760]   and you do the definitive endocrine intervention,
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.000]   which is you do a subtraction study,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.360]   you've removed the testes, and as I said before,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.260]   levels of sexual behavior goes down.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.360]   Good, we've just shown that testosterone
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.220]   is somehow causative.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.440]   Critically, they go down, but not down to zero,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.440]   whether you are a rat or a monkey or a human, whatever.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.880]   And what predicts how much residual sexual behavior is there,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.640]   how much sexual behavior there was before castration.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   What that's telling you is by then,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.060]   that's behavior that's being carried by social learning
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.080]   in context, rather than by a hormone, exact same thing
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.120]   with aggression, drops after castration, doesn't go to zero.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.280]   The more prior history of it,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.740]   the more it just keeps coasting along on its own,
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.880]   even without testosterone.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.420]   - Very interesting, can we say that there's an exception
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.560]   in terms of the early organizing effects of hormones?
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.040]   Like for instance, if a developing animal is deprived
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.500]   of testosterone or estrogen or aromatized testosterone
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.840]   into estrogen, there's a whole story there as you know,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.160]   but then I could imagine that the circuits of the brain
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.500]   that are responsible for initiating sexual behavior
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.240]   in the first place might not emerge
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.560]   and therefore not be sensitive to testosterone later in life.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.400]   Is that right?
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.000]   - Yeah, exactly, and a great way of seeing that
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.360]   is this totally nutty biological factoid,
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.840]   which is the second to fourth digit ratio in hands.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.680]   - Oh yeah.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.220]   - Totally obscure thing, the ratio of one to the other
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.740]   in some way reflects levels of testosterone androgen
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.820]   exposure during fetal life.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.980]   And I can't remember which way it goes and it's minuscule
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.680]   and you need a thousand people in your sample size
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.100]   to be able to see anything,
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.920]   but you see it in other primates, it's already there
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.020]   and fetal, sonograms, all of that.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.740]   So that's a readout of subtle differences
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.960]   in prenatal exposure and that winds up being a predictor
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.760]   of a whole range of subtle stuff in adult behavior.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.100]   So yeah, at the fetal end,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.800]   when you're still building everything,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.540]   testosterone and the amount of it
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.240]   is making a huge difference.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.060]   By the time you're an adult,
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.340]   it's just somewhat of an all or none signal.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.260]   - Yeah, I have a confession,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.380]   which is that I was a master's student at Berkeley
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.660]   in Mark Breedlove's arena.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.400]   So I'm an author on that paper,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.300]   although I'm deep within the author line
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.020]   and you got the description of it exactly right,
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.540]   that it's the D2, the index finger to the ring finger ratio
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.180]   is more similar in females and then it is in males.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.140]   In males, the index finger tends to be shorter.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.860]   And for people out there who are listening to this,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.720]   who are now freaking out or measuring,
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.420]   there's a proper way to measure this,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.360]   which is eyeballing it doesn't work all the time
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.540]   unless at the extremes.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.460]   And there's some more interesting stories there.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.460]   It actually has been replicated no fewer than five times,
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.180]   Mark Breedlove tells me.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.320]   But yes, in terms of these early organizing effects,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.720]   those seem very robust in most studies.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.500]   These later effects are a sort of activation
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.060]   of neural circuits by hormones.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.300]   I'm absolutely fascinated by this.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.160]   And I do have a couple other questions,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.680]   which is we normally associate testosterone with males,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.620]   but of course, females make testosterone as well
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.140]   from the adrenals and presumably elsewhere too.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.540]   I'm guessing if we looked hard enough,
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.120]   we'd probably find that there were other sources
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.040]   of androgens in females.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.940]   Can we say that these general contours of effects
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.540]   on aggression also pertain to females?
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.100]   And I suppose I should ask in particular
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.540]   about female-female aggression,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.260]   which does exist in many species,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.180]   female-male aggression, as well as maternal aggression,
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.420]   which is a robust aspect of our evolution, of course,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.160]   that the mother will, an angry mother animal of any kind
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.540]   protecting her young is truly dangerous
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.100]   in the best sense of the word.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.880]   - And that type of post-parturition period
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.760]   after birth aggression is all about estrogen,
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.740]   progesterone, those sorts of things.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   Female aggression the rest of the time
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.660]   has testosterone as a major player
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.580]   at a much lower level on the average,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.420]   on the average, one always has to say,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.740]   but it's basically the same punchlines.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.900]   In females, the lower levels of testosterone
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.420]   are essential for typical levels of aggression
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.060]   and sexual behavior.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.000]   None of us, they're not causing it.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.920]   It's not sensitive to small individual differences.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.260]   Same exact thing.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.780]   You can get way over impressed
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.700]   with the importance of androgens in females
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.120]   just as readily as in males.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.780]   - So in line with that,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.820]   how should we conceptualize testosterone?
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.940]   I mean, I realize there isn't a single sentence
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.340]   or that can capture a hormone and all its effects
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.180]   because hormones have so many different slow
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.300]   and fast effects on the brain, on other glands,
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.340]   on their own, on the very glands that produce them.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.960]   But as I've heard you talk about testosterone today
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.320]   and over the years, I start to get the impression
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.940]   that as the most misunderstood molecule
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.120]   in human health in the universe,
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.700]   it's clearly doing something very powerful.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.540]   It's shifting the way that certain neural circuits work,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.820]   adjusting the gain on the amygdala, as you described,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.380]   and certainly other things as well.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.560]   Is there any truism about testosterone
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.460]   and its relationship to effort
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.300]   or its relationship to resilience
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.400]   and in a way that maybe will help me and other people
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.120]   sort of think about how to think about testosterone?
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.040]   - Yeah, maybe three separate answers to that.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.640]   The first one is I think it's a fair summary
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   to think that when it comes to motivated strong behaviors,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.400]   what testosterone does is make you more
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.840]   of whatever you already are in that domain.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.000]   Sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.780]   spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.940]   things of that sort.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.540]   It's upping the volume of things
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.140]   that are already strongly there.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.100]   Second way to think about it is,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.960]   well, here's like my favorite finding about testosterone.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.540]   And this was some wonderful work by a guy, John Wingfield,
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.960]   who's one of the best behavioral endocrinologists out there.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.880]   And about 20 years ago, he formulated what was called
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.600]   the challenge hypothesis of testosterone action.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.760]   What does testosterone do?
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.320]   Testosterone is what you secrete
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.980]   when your status is being challenged.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.760]   And it makes it more likely that you'll do the behaviors
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.280]   needed to hold onto your status.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.960]   Okay, so that's totally boringly straightforward
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.200]   if you're a baboon.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.020]   If somebody is challenging your high rank,
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.700]   the appropriate response on your part
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.440]   is going to be aggression.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.760]   All right, so we've just gotten through the back door
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.820]   to testosterone and aggression again.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.680]   But then you get to humans.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.720]   And humans have lots of different ways
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.320]   of achieving or maintaining status.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.620]   And all you need to do is go to like some fancy
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.720]   private school's annual auction,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.320]   and you will see all these half-drunk alpha males
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.720]   competing to see who can give the most money away
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.120]   as a show of conspicuous like, you know,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.480]   property that they have.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.800]   And in a setting like that, I mean,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.680]   I haven't been able to take urine samples
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.300]   at those times, unfortunately,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.880]   but that shows the flip side of it.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.680]   If you have a species that hands out status
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   in a very different sort of way,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.720]   testosterone is going to boost that also.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.960]   Okay, so that generates a totally nutty prediction.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   Wow, take people in a circumstance,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.960]   say playing an economic game,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.600]   where you get status by being trustworthy
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.660]   and being generous in your interactions with the game.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.840]   If you give people testosterone,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.240]   does that make them more generous?
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   And that's absolutely the case.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.980]   Totally cool finding.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.600]   Showing you, I don't know,
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.960]   basically if you took a whole bunch of Buddhist monks
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.240]   and shot them up with testosterone,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.120]   they'd get all competitive with each other
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.440]   as to who could do the most random acts of kindness.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   And if we have a societal problem with too much aggression,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   the first culprit to look at is not testosterone.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.120]   The first to look at is that we hand out
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.480]   so much damn elevated status for aggression
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.000]   in so many circumstances.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.600]   So I find that finding to be fantastic.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   Third thing about subtlety of testosterone.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.240]   Okay, so like some subtler behavioral effects,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.320]   you give testosterone to people
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.840]   and they become more confident.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.400]   They become more self-confident.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.440]   Well, that's good.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.620]   People pay to take all sorts of nonsensical self-help courses
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.920]   that will boost your self-esteem.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.680]   And that's a good thing.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.640]   Unless testosterone makes you more confident,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.420]   that is inaccurate.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.040]   And you're more likely to barrel into wrong decisions.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   What's shown in economic gameplay
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   is that testosterone, by making you more confident,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.960]   makes you less cooperative.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.360]   Because who needs to cooperate?
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.580]   Because I'm on top of this all on my own.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.600]   Testosterone makes people cocky and impulsive.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.920]   And that may be great in one setting,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.240]   but if in the other is you're absolutely sure
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   your army is gonna overrun the other country in three days.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.560]   So hell, let's start World War I
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.800]   and you get a big surprise out of it.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.640]   Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.720]   probably played a big role in that kind of miscalculation.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.080]   - Super interesting.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.480]   I always think about testosterone and dopamine
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.680]   being close cousins in the brain,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   not just because of their relationship
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.760]   through the pituitary and hypothalamus, that of course,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.920]   but also because of dopamine's salient role
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.240]   in creating this bias towards exteroception.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.840]   When somebody takes a drug that increases dopamine
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.280]   or they're chock-a-block full of dopamine,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.680]   they tend, I want to highlight tend
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.020]   'cause I'm really generalizing it,
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.920]   but they tend to focus on outward goals,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.740]   things beyond the boundaries of their skin.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.200]   And testosterone seems to do a bit of the same.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   It tends to put us into a similar mode
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   of perceiving the outside world
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.760]   in ways that we're asking questions like,
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.800]   how do I relate to this other of my species?
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.740]   How do I relate to these goals?
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.600]   Is there anything that we can do
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.560]   to better conceptualize the relationship
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.680]   between testosterone and dopamine and motivation?
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.840]   Or would that just take us down the alleyways
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.780]   of neural pathways and the hypothalamus, which was fine too.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.300]   - Well, I think it's got lots to do
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.960]   with sort of this massive revisionism about dopamine.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   Everyone since the pharaohs got brought up
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.480]   being taught that dopamine is about pleasure and reward.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   It turns out it isn't.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.560]   It's about anticipation of reward.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.080]   And it's about generating the motivation,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.040]   the goal-directed behavior needed to go get that reward.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.080]   And before you know it,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.080]   you're using like elevated dopamine your entire life
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.760]   to motivate you to do whatever's going to get you
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.240]   like entry into heaven after life.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.920]   Kind of, you know, it's doing that sort of thing.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.600]   So it's really about the motivation.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.520]   And what testosterone does,
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.160]   even in individuals who are not aggressive
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.360]   and why testosterone replacement
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.600]   is often a very helpful thing for aging males,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.720]   is it increases energy.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.120]   It increases a sense of there-ness,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.680]   of presence, of alertness.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.360]   It increases motivation.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.460]   So that's a whole aspect which then takes us into
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.460]   is your motivation to get up and like go, you know,
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.300]   hand out lots of soup in a soup kitchen for homeless people?
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.100]   Or is it to get up and go ethnically cleanse a village?
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.060]   It's got much to do with what your makeup was
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.500]   before the testosterone got on board.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.700]   So it's activating in an energetic sense.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.160]   Testosterone within minutes
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.700]   increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.420]   You're just more awake and alert and all of that.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.120]   And that has a lot to do with what dopamine does.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.260]   And as one might predict then,
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.300]   getting just the right levels of testosterone
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.740]   infused into your bloodstream feels great to lab rats.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.920]   They will lever press to get infused into the range
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.960]   that optimizes dopamine release.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   So there's, you're absolutely right.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.460]   You're deeply intertwined.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.540]   - Yeah, such beautiful biology there.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.280]   And I love the way you encapsulate their relationship.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.360]   I want to ask about estrogen.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.340]   We don't hear about estrogen as often.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.500]   And it's always interesting to me now
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.100]   doing some public facing education, you know,
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.600]   that testosterone is this very controversial molecule.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.300]   Just to say it is almost controversial.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.420]   But estrogen doesn't seem to hold
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.540]   the same controversial weight.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.660]   And yet estrogen has some very powerful effects
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   on both the animal brain and on the human brain
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.080]   of males and females.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.900]   Men do not want their estrogen to go too low.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.020]   Terrible things happen.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.980]   They will lose cognitive function.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.940]   Libido can drop.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.640]   So men need estrogen as well.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.300]   But perhaps maybe we can put the same filter on estrogen
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.420]   as we did on testosterone.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.920]   Are there any general themes of estrogen
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.760]   that people should be aware of
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.660]   or that you think that are generally misunderstood?
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.060]   Is it really all about feelings and empathy
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.360]   and making us more sensitive?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.260]   I sense not.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.020]   - No, and it's once again, very context dependent.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.220]   And if estrogen after giving birth
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.340]   is playing a central role in you wanting to shred the face
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.340]   of somebody getting too close to your kittens kind of thing,
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:53.340]   we know it's not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind of stuff.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.100]   Estrogen in lots of ways could be summarized
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.240]   by if you had a choice in the matter
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.340]   between having a lot of estrogen in your bloodstream or not,
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.700]   go for having a lot of estrogen.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.000]   It enhances cognition exactly as you said.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.560]   It stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.980]   It increases glucose and oxygen delivery.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.660]   It protects you from dementia.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.660]   It decreases inflammatory oxidative damage to blood vessels,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.500]   which is why it's good for protecting
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.460]   from cardiovascular disease in contrast to testosterone,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.220]   which is making every one of those things worse.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:38.180]   This brings up this minefield of the question,
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.480]   which is so what about post-menopausal estrogen?
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.380]   And all sorts of lab studies with non-human primates
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.460]   suggested that you keep estrogen levels high
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.060]   after a monkey's equivalent of menopause
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.260]   and you're gonna keep brain health a lot better,
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.980]   decreasing the risk of dementia, stroke, every such thing.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   Estrogen is a great antioxidant, all of that.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   So in the '90s, I think when Healy, I'm forgetting her name,
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:15.580]   but when there was the first female head of the NIH,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:20.580]   Bernadette Healy, set up this massive prospective
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.100]   human study, what was gonna be the biggest one of all times,
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.420]   looking at the pluses and minuses
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.700]   of post-menopausal estrogen.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.380]   And tens of thousands of women, this was great,
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.540]   and they had to cut the study short
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.380]   because what they were seeing was estrogen
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.860]   was not only doing the normal bad stuff that you expect
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.260]   in terms of some decalcification stuff,
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.900]   but it was increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.740]   And it was increasing the risk of stroke
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.260]   and it was increasing the risk of dementia.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.220]   And this ground to a halt and everybody,
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.820]   they stopped the study in front page news
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.380]   and everybody had that point.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.740]   And nobody could make sense of it
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.700]   who had been spending the last 20 years
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.900]   studying the exact same thing in primates
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.380]   and seeing all the protective effects.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.380]   And the explanation turned out to be one of those things
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.340]   where like law of unexpected consequences.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.660]   Okay, menopause in women last different lengths of time.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.700]   That may be a factor that's gonna come.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.780]   You know what?
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.340]   Let's not start giving our study subjects more estrogen
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.260]   until they're totally past menopause.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.180]   And when you've got that lag time in between,
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.500]   you shift all sorts of estrogen receptor patterns
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   and that's where all of the bad effects come from.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.980]   All of the monkey studies had involved
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.900]   just maintaining ovulatory levels
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.340]   into the post-menopausal period.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.260]   And you do that and you get great effects.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.700]   Estrogen is one of the greatest predictors
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.660]   of protection from Alzheimer's disease, all of that,
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.220]   but it needs to be physiological.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.100]   Just keep continuing what your body has been doing
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.700]   for a long time versus let the whole thing shut down
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.000]   and suddenly like try to fire up the coal stoves
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.940]   at the bottom of the basement kind of thing
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.540]   and get that going.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.100]   There you get utterly different outcomes.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.340]   And that caused a lot of human health consequences
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.540]   when people suddenly decided that estrogen
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.540]   is in fact neurologically endangering post-menopausal aid.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.380]   - Wow, that's fascinating.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.060]   And I never thought that these steroid hormone receptors
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.380]   could, you know, by not binding estrogen,
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.940]   being devoid of estrogen binding, I should say,
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.080]   could then set off opposite biochemical cascades.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.920]   Fascinating.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.840]   I guess it raises the question
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.500]   about testosterone replacement too,
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.280]   whether or not people should talk to their doctor
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.920]   before too long.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.940]   Men and women talk to your physicians before too long
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.180]   to avoid these, whatever is happening in these periods
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.980]   where there isn't sufficient testosterone and/or estrogen.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.820]   Sounds like it could cause longer-term problems
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.580]   even when therapies are introduced.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.700]   - Two additional misery/complications.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.360]   So, okay, you're trying to understand,
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.500]   you look at women with a history
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.580]   with or without post-menopausal estrogen replacement,
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.500]   where it's done right, and you're seeing 20 years later,
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.780]   estrogen is a predictor of a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.500]   Then you gotta start trying to do
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.340]   the unpacking prospective type studies.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.200]   How much estrogen?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.100]   At which times?
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   Estrogen is just a catch-all term for a bunch of hormones.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.060]   Estrone, estradiol, estriol.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.780]   How much of each one of them?
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.620]   Natural or synthetic?
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.660]   Go try to figure all of that out.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.780]   And the second complication is,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.500]   it's often hard to say anything about what estrogen does,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.020]   outside the context of what progesterone is doing.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.040]   And often it's not the absolute levels of either,
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.940]   it's the ratio of the two.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.460]   This is such a more complicated endocrine system
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.700]   than testosterone.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   And because you have to generate dramatic cyclicity
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.420]   that no male hypothalamus ever has to dream of.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.360]   It's a much, much more complicated system.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.380]   Thus, it's a lot more complicated to understand
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   let alone like figure out what the ideal benefits are of it.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.820]   - Yeah, I don't know what to make of the literature
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.060]   on dropping rates of testosterone
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.380]   and endocrine disruptors.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.060]   I was at Berkeley when Tyrone Hayes published his data
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.720]   on these frogs that were drinking water
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.860]   from various locations throughout the United States,
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.220]   not just in California,
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.060]   and seeing very severe endocrine disruption
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.880]   through blockade and of androgen receptors
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.860]   and all sorts of issues.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.500]   And you hear this all the time now
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.140]   that sperm counts are dropping,
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.100]   that there are all these endocrine disruptors,
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.460]   that there's birth control in the water,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.540]   in the drinking water.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.680]   It all starts to sound a little crazy.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.140]   And yet I've also been fooled before by,
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.500]   I guess a good example would be,
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.980]   there's a lot of crazy stuff in the world online
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.760]   about all the terrible stuff in highly processed foods.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.980]   And yet you've got very respectable people,
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.860]   endocrinologists at UCSF, like Robert Lustig saying,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.020]   yeah, a lot of these hidden sugars and these emulsifiers,
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.220]   they're causing real problems.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.920]   So I've become more open-minded about the question.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.940]   And so are we suffering from drops in sperm counts
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.960]   and testosterone and estrogen and fertility
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.560]   as a consequence of endocrine disruptors
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.580]   in the environments and food,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.580]   or because of social reasons?
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.520]   Is there anything that we can hang our hat on,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.060]   like real data that you're confident in,
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.260]   or is it just a mess?
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.820]   - No, the phenomenon does appear to be quite real.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.380]   Cross-sectional studies, human populations,
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.880]   or I still don't understand why this was one
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.140]   of the first things that Hayes spotted,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.700]   decreasing testicle size in crocodiles.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.740]   Go figure why that was one of the first contributions
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.700]   to this.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.660]   And I think the phenomenon is absolutely real.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.780]   And what you're then left with is two classic challenges,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.320]   which is this is correlated with something broad,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   environmental toxins, which ones, how much, when, et cetera.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.180]   And the other one always being, well, okay, dropping.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.120]   Is it dropping enough to make a difference?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.620]   How big of an effect is this?
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.060]   And those are where the juries are still out.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.940]   - Yeah, it's an area that I know there's a lot
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.940]   of interest in, and you've got groups of people
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.740]   who won't touch a receipt at a store
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.580]   because of the BPAs that are on the inks of the,
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.460]   and then you've got people who don't care about those things.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.340]   It is a fascinating area,
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.060]   and I hope that more biology will be done there soon.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.680]   I'd like to briefly return to stress.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.460]   You described a study once about two rats,
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.220]   one running on a wheel voluntarily,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.260]   one who's basically stuck in a running wheel
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.340]   and is forced to run anytime rat number one runs.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.740]   So in one case, the rat is voluntarily exercising,
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.700]   and in the other case,
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.620]   the rat is being forced to go to PE class, so to speak,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.620]   but really, and seeing divergent effects on biology.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.060]   And I'd like to just touch into this
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.620]   and use it as kind of a case study
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.980]   for stress mitigation in general.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.020]   I'm rather obsessed, and our colleague, David Spiegel,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.660]   Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford,
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.400]   is obsessed with this question
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.960]   of how humans can start to mitigate their own stress.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.780]   What do you think about stress mitigation,
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.320]   and what should we do as individuals and as families
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.740]   and as a culture to try and encourage people
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.620]   to mitigate their stress,
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.080]   but in ways that are not going to turn us
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.240]   into rat number two, where we're being forced
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.520]   to mitigate our own stress
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.820]   and therefore becomes more stressful?
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.420]   - And what you see is rat number one
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.040]   gets all the benefits of exercise.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.100]   Rat number two gets all the downsides of severe stress
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.720]   with the same exact muscle expenditure
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.920]   and movements going on, perfectly yoked,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.040]   great example that it's the interpretation in your head.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.800]   And I haven't kept up with that literature,
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.980]   but I'll bet you rat number two
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.220]   is having a whole lot more activity in its amygdala
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.600]   than is rat number one.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.020]   Okay, so stress mitigation.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.460]   Anything I should say here, I should preface with,
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.780]   reasonably good at telling people what's gonna happen
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.760]   if they don't manage their stress,
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.460]   but I'm terrible at actually like managing stress
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.620]   or advising how to manage it.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.180]   I'm much better with the bad news aspect of it,
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:23.180]   but what you see is by now just a classic literature,
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.880]   half a century old, sort of showing
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.420]   what are the building blocks of stress.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.400]   Not, ooh, you step outside
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.000]   and you've been gored by an elephant
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.880]   and can you grow from your experience
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.600]   and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.260]   You could have a stress response,
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.940]   but you're in the realm of the gray zone
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.900]   of ambiguous social interactions, that sort of thing.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.260]   Some people have massive stress responses,
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.760]   others not at all in between enjoy it.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.460]   Like what are the building blocks
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.140]   of what makes psychological stress stressful?
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.500]   And the first one is exactly what is brought up
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.660]   by that running study.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.480]   Do you have a sense of control?
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.360]   A sense of control makes stressors less stressful.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.460]   And the running wheel shows that
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.780]   or studies where you, you lab rat
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.380]   or you college freshmen volunteer
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.580]   have been trained that by pressing the lever,
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.840]   you're less likely to get a shock.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.780]   And today you're at the lever there working away
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.660]   and unbeknownst to you, the lever has been turned off
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.240]   and it has no effect on shock frequency,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.560]   but because you think you have some control,
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.440]   you have less of a stress response.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.060]   If you were a rat and doing this day in and day out,
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.140]   you're less likely to get an ulcer.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.980]   So a sense of control.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:46.380]   Related to that is a sense of predictability.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.440]   Rat gets shocked, human gets shocked, whatever.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.160]   And the scenario either is the shocks come now and then,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.700]   or the shocks come now and then,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:59.080]   and 10 seconds before a little warning light comes on.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.920]   And when you get the warning light,
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.260]   the shocks aren't as stressful.
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.020]   You got predictability
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.460]   because if you're not getting warning lights,
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.080]   any second you could be a half second away
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.020]   from the next shock, you get a warning light
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.940]   and you know that if there isn't one,
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.940]   you've got at least 10 seconds worth of relaxation.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.980]   You know what's coming.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.420]   You can prepare your coping responses
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.260]   and best of all, afterward,
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.580]   you know when you're finally safe,
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.620]   when you can recover from it.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.020]   And that's enormously protective.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.340]   Others, outlet for frustration.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.540]   You take a rat who's getting shocked
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.620]   and if it could run on a running wheel,
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.360]   that's a protective thing.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.200]   It's doing it voluntarily.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.280]   If you've got a rat and it can gnaw on a bar of wood,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.120]   a stressor is less stressful.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.460]   Unfortunately, if you have a rat or primate or human
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.620]   and they're stressed,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.020]   the ability to aggressively dump on somebody smaller
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.420]   and weaker also reduces the stress response
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.220]   and displacement aggression,
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.760]   and the fact that displacement aggression reduces stress
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.920]   accounts for a huge percentage of Earth's unhappiness.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.100]   So all of those variables get social support as well.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.940]   That's a good one.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.680]   Interpreting circumstances,
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.860]   being good news rather than bad, hooray.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.700]   So you've got this very simple sort of take home recipe
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.300]   of go out and get as much control
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.120]   and as much predictability and as many outlets
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.460]   and as much social support as possible,
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.940]   and you're gonna do just fine.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.220]   And you go out and do that
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.980]   and that's a recipe for total disaster
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.700]   because it's much, much more subtle than that.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.420]   One great example.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.960]   Okay, so you're getting shocks.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.120]   Do you want a warning beforehand?
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.720]   Get a little warning light 10 seconds before each shock.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.620]   It's wonderfully protective.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:56.620]   Get a warning light one second before the shock.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.060]   Doesn't do anything.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.180]   There's not enough time for you
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:03.380]   to get the psychological benefits of the anticipation.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.360]   Now instead, get the little warning coming on two minutes
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.940]   before each shock and it's gonna make things worse
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.460]   because you're not gonna be sitting there like,
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:18.780]   you know, reveling in sort of your sense of predictability
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.300]   and it's soon gonna be over.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.660]   You're gonna be sitting there for two minutes saying,
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.360]   damn, here it comes.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.840]   Predictive information only works in a narrow domain.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.820]   Similarly, control.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.300]   Do you wanna have a sense of control in the face of stress?
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:40.300]   And the answer is only if it is a mild to moderate stressor
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.180]   because what's happening then,
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.440]   your sense of control is completely independent
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.220]   of the reality of whether you have control or not.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.700]   But in the face of mild to moderate stressors,
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.660]   a sense of control gets interpreted as,
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.580]   wow, look how much worse things could have been.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.300]   Thank God I have control.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.860]   I'm on top of this to master my fate.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.320]   In contrast, if it's a major stressor,
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.280]   all that a, you know, arbitrary sense of control does
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.660]   is make you think, oh my God,
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.460]   look how much better it could have been.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.100]   I could have prevented it.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.860]   And we all know that intuitively,
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.380]   like we do that in the face of people's worst stressors.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.380]   Nobody could have stopped the car
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.980]   the way the kids suddenly jumped out.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.300]   It wouldn't have mattered if you had gotten them
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.260]   to the doctor a month ago instead of now,
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.320]   it wouldn't have made me,
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.340]   you didn't actually have any control.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.200]   And what you see is you absolutely want to have
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.940]   a huge sense of control over mild to moderate stressors
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.460]   and especially ones that result in a good outcome.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.780]   Hooray for me.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.180]   And in the face of horrible stressors,
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:54.820]   what you want to do is like self-deception
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.120]   and like truth and beauty don't necessarily go hand in hand
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.380]   at that point.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.020]   And that's why stress management techniques
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.140]   about control and predictability
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.700]   wind up being far worse than neutral
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.960]   if you're preaching that to somebody homeless
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.280]   or somebody with terminal cancer
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.940]   or somebody who's a refugee,
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.500]   tell a neurotic middle-class person
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.780]   that they have the psychological tools
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.400]   to turn, you know, hell into heaven.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.980]   And there's some truth to that.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.720]   Do the same thing to somebody
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.040]   who's going through a real hell.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   And that's just privileged, you know, heartlessness
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.160]   to do that because that doesn't work.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.220]   More and more, you know, outlets,
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.040]   if your outlets are damaging,
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.100]   that's not a good way to mitigate stress.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.300]   Social support.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.620]   If you're confusing mere acquaintances
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.340]   for real social support,
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.720]   you're going to have the rug pulled out
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.240]   from under you at some point.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.360]   If you're mistaking social support for being,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.400]   going and bitching and moaning and demanding supportiveness
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   from everyone around you,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.980]   rather than you doing some of that reciprocally,
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.620]   that's not going to work very well either.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.580]   So, you know, it's not simple.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:12.220]   It's not for nothing that lots of us are really lousy at,
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.140]   like being good friends and things like that
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.700]   and why it takes a lot of work to like do it right.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.200]   Because, you know, you do it wrong
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.220]   and it may temporarily seem like a great thing,
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.340]   but when it turns out to be completely misplaced faith,
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.140]   you're going to be feeling worse than before you started.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.960]   - Interesting.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.400]   These days, there's a lot of interest
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.360]   in using physical practices to mitigate stress.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.980]   You know, trying to get out of the ruminating
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:45.360]   and to some extent take control of neural circuits
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.320]   in the brain by using exercise
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.340]   and using breathing and hypnosis.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:55.280]   And of course, hypnosis has a mental component as well.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.380]   What are your thoughts on stress mitigation
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.780]   from the standpoint of, okay,
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.420]   so we don't want to be rat number two.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.340]   We want to select something for ourselves.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.680]   So we have to take the initiative for ourselves.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.380]   Being forced into exercising is not,
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.240]   it could actually have negative health effects perhaps.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.980]   So we need to pick something that we like.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.600]   We need to take control of it.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.700]   In terms of supporting other people,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.300]   you touched on that a bit.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.020]   What is the best way to support other people?
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.620]   Is it to talk about the stressful thing?
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.640]   I mean, I'm not asking you to play psychologist here,
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.660]   but I find divergent data on this.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:34.740]   You know, we can spin ourselves up into a lather
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.700]   by ruminating on something.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.100]   And language seems to me like it's a wonderful tool,
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.640]   but it's also a fairly deprived tool
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.620]   because it doesn't really get into the core
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.900]   of our physiology like something like breathing would.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.800]   So what are your thoughts on more,
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.220]   for lack of a better way to put it,
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.580]   more head-centered cognitive approaches to stress mitigation
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.420]   versus kind of going at the core physiology,
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.060]   cold showers now, or even a thing to some extent,
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.340]   you know, just to get people stress acclimated,
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.640]   voluntarily taking cold showers, you know?
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.820]   - That makes some sense physiologically preconditioning
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.460]   for when the real stressors come.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.740]   In terms of what you bring up, oh, transcendental meditation,
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.520]   mindfulness, exercise, prayer,
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.340]   sort of reflecting on gratitude, all that sort of thing.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.720]   Collectively, they work on the average.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.280]   They work in terms of they can lower heart rate
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.900]   and cholesterol levels and have all sorts of good outcomes,
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.980]   but they come with provisos.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.820]   One is exactly the caveat that comes out
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.620]   of the running wheel study is it doesn't matter
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.180]   how many of your friends swear
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.420]   by this stress management technique.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.120]   If doing it makes you want to scream your head off
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.820]   after 10 seconds,
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.580]   that's not the one that's going to work for you.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.420]   So, you know, read the fine print and the testimonials,
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.220]   but it's gotta be something that works for you.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.700]   Another one is the stress management type techniques
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:11.140]   that work, you can't save them for the weekend.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.500]   You can't save them for when you're stuck on hold
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.060]   on the phone with Muzak for two minutes.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.380]   It's gotta be something where you stop what you're doing
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.420]   and do it virtually daily or every other day
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.260]   and spend 20, 30 minutes doing it.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.220]   And what you see coming out of that
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.540]   is this like 80/20 rule from economics.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.340]   80/20, 80% of the complaints in the store
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.860]   come from 20% of the customers, things like that.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.980]   What you see is if your entire life consists
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.260]   of every single thing on your shoulders
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.700]   that you can't say no to 24/7,
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.180]   if you've stopped that and finally said,
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.340]   my wellbeing is important enough,
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.420]   that I'm finally going to say no to some of the stuff
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.780]   that I can't say no to,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.540]   and I'm going to do it every day for 20 minutes,
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.060]   whatever stress management technique you then do
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.240]   in those 20 minutes, short of who knows what,
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.700]   you're already 80% of the way there
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.340]   simply by having decided your wellbeing is important enough
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.860]   that you're going to stop every single day
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.700]   and have that as priority.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.300]   And that's exactly the same finding
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.020]   that you find people with chronic depression untreated
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:26.040]   that merely calling and getting an appointment
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.200]   to see a mental health professional,
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.640]   people start feeling better already
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.460]   because it's evidence that you've been activated
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.140]   and you matter enough to do this
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.140]   and you could conceive that this would actually
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.940]   have a good outcome rather than a hopeless one.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.940]   Just doing something meditative
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.780]   or reflective every day or so,
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:52.020]   and it hardly even matters which one you're doing.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.100]   And what comes out of that is thus another warning,
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.940]   which is do not trust anybody
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.740]   who says it has been scientifically proven
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.260]   that their brand of stress management
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.940]   works better than the other ones.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:08.100]   Just watch your wallet at that point.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.040]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.100]   I think one of the core goals of my lab
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.420]   and David Spiegel's lab,
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.620]   and I know you've worked with David
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.520]   and published papers with David as well,
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.340]   is to really try and find out
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.300]   what are the various entry points
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.900]   to this thing that we call the autonomic nervous system
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.100]   and the stress system and the systems that,
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.900]   when gone unchecked, really can take us down a dark path.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.980]   And the idea that there are so many entry points
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.500]   is really the one that keeps,
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.460]   what the data keep telling us over and over again.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.060]   So there's no magic breathing tool or exercise.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.700]   It's any variety of those or one of those.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.580]   And again, we come back to this idea
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.860]   that it's the one that you select
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.580]   and the one that you make space for,
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:50.680]   and it's the one that you hopefully enjoy
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.200]   that's going to work best in terms of physiology.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.060]   - I'm one that's benign
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.420]   for those people who were stuck around you.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.500]   - Right, right, absolutely.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.100]   And that brings me to this question of,
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:08.100]   I find it amazing that how we perceive an event
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.220]   and whether or not we chose to be in that event or not
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.140]   can have such incredibly different effects
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.500]   on circuitry of the brain and circuitry of the body
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.100]   and biology of cells.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.060]   And in some ways it boggles my mind,
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.700]   like how can a decision made presumably
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.380]   with the prefrontal cortex,
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.260]   although other parts of the brain as well,
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.420]   how can that change essentially the polarity
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   of a response in the body?
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.660]   And I mean, you've talked before about type A personalities
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.780]   and we don't have to go into all the detail there
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.620]   for sake of time,
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.260]   but it is interesting that the effects of endothelial cells,
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.260]   I mean, literally of the size of the portals for blood
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.300]   are in opposite direction,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.140]   depending on whether or not somebody
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.500]   wants to be in a situation, is a highly motivated person.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.100]   Maybe you could just give us the top contour of that,
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.900]   because I think it really illustrates this principle
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.860]   so beautifully.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.660]   And then maybe if you would,
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.320]   you could just speculate on how the brain might have
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.740]   this switch to turn one experience from terrible
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.660]   to beneficial or from beneficial to terrible.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:20.100]   It's really fascinating.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.180]   - Well, I mean, all you need to do is like tonight
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.780]   before you're going to sleep and you're lying in bed
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.180]   and you're nice and drowsy
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.700]   and your heart's beating nice and slow,
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.420]   you'll start thinking about the fact that, you know,
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.820]   that heart isn't going to beat forever.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.580]   And imagine your toes getting cold
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.140]   after we're going to imagine the flow of blood
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.180]   coming to a halt and all of you clotting.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.340]   And if you're really,
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:49.700]   you're going to be doing something with your physiology
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.820]   at that point that 99% of mammals out there only do
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.820]   if they're running frantically.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.180]   And you're going to be turning on
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.420]   your synthetic stress response with thought,
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   with emotions, with memory.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:05.420]   And the measure of that is just how much the cortex
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.060]   and the limbic system sends projections down
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.540]   to all the autonomic regulators in the brain.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.340]   You can think autonomic regulatory neurons into action
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.500]   in ways that only other animals can do
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.620]   with like extremes of environmental circumstances.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.940]   Given that and the autonomic rule,
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.420]   I mean, the other big challenge in understanding it
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:34.140]   is gigantic individual differences.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.700]   And that's, you know,
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.820]   we talk about the optimal amount of stress
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.340]   that counts as stimulation.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.660]   And in general, that's stress that's not too severe
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.060]   and doesn't go on for too long
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.180]   and is overall in a benevolent setting.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.540]   And under those conditions,
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.780]   we love being stressed by something unexpected
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.540]   and out of control and predictability,
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.820]   like a really interesting plot turn
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.300]   in the movie you're watching.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.700]   That's great, but you get the individual differences
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.380]   that somehow has to accommodate the fact that
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.780]   for some people, the perfect stimulatory amount of stress
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:15.500]   is like getting up early for an Audubon bird watching walk
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.740]   next Sunday morning.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   And for somebody else,
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.220]   it's signing up to be like a mercenary in Yemen.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.700]   And tremendous individual differences
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.700]   that swamp any simple, you know, prescriptions.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.260]   - Yeah, the prefrontal cortex,
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.460]   this thinking machinery that we all harbor,
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.900]   it's such a double-edged sword.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:42.900]   And what's remarkable to me is how the areas of the brain,
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.860]   like the hypothalamus and the amygdala,
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.460]   they're sort of like switches.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.100]   I mean, there's context and there's gain control.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.520]   You talked about the gain control by testosterone, et cetera,
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.780]   but they're really like switches.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.580]   I mean, if you stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus,
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.500]   you get the right neurons,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.020]   an animal will try and kill even an object
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.840]   that's sitting next to it.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.180]   You tickle some other neurons,
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.220]   it'll try and mate with that same object.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.920]   I mean, it's really wild.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.460]   I think there are probably rules to prefrontal cortex also,
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.520]   but it sounds like the context, plural,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.820]   from which prefrontal cortex can draw from
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.780]   is probably infinite.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.920]   So that we could probably learn to perceive threat
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.900]   in anything, whether or not it's another group
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.580]   or whether or not it's science or whether or not
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.540]   it's somebody's version of the shape of the earth
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.380]   versus another.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.820]   I mean, it's like you can plug in anything to this system
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.300]   and give it enough data.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.860]   And I think it sounds like you could drive a fear response
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.100]   or a love response.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.580]   Is that overstepping?
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.500]   - Or a mixed, hardly ambivalent one
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.900]   that is changing by the millisecond
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.940]   and then like initially contradictory?
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.500]   No, that's absolutely the case.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.420]   And the prefrontal cortex,
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.420]   I more than once have regretted having like wasted 30 years
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.060]   of my life studying the hippocampus
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.660]   when I should have been studying the prefrontal cortex
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.460]   because it's so much more interesting what it does.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.460]   And it's all this contextual stuff.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.180]   It's all the ways in which it's not okay to lie
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.420]   in this setting, but it's a great thing in another.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.660]   It's not okay to kill unless you do it to them.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.620]   And then you get a medal.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.620]   It's not all of this social context and moral relativity
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.100]   and situational ethics stuff.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.020]   That's the prefrontal cortex that's got to master that.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.980]   And that winds up meaning that's the place in your brain
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   more than anywhere where you say your perception of things
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.460]   can powerfully influence the reality
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.780]   of what's coming into you.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   I mean, great example, just harking back to testosterone.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.900]   Okay, so exercise boosts up testosterone levels.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.660]   Does exercise and success do it more than exercise
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.580]   and failure of literature back in the '80s or so,
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.060]   looking at outcomes of marathons.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.780]   Did testosterone rise more in the people who win
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.140]   than the losers?
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.460]   Wrestling matches, things of that sort
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.220]   with a simple prediction and the answer wound up being
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.620]   you didn't see a simple answer.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.660]   Okay, you win the marathon.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.980]   That's not necessarily an increase,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.140]   a predictor of increased testosterone.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.460]   What's that about?
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   And then you find like the winner, testosterone decreases.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.900]   And you find out the guy who came in 73rd
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.860]   is having a massive testosterone increase.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.820]   Whoa, what's that about?
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.500]   What's that about is far more human subtlety.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.020]   The guy who won the race has a decline in testosterone
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.020]   because he came in three minutes later
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.460]   than he really, really was expecting.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.740]   And everybody now is going to be writing it up
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.700]   about how he's over the hill.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.500]   And the guy who came in 73rd
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.420]   is having a boost of testosterone
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.260]   because he was assuming he'd be dead from a heart attack
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.500]   by the third mile and instead he managed to finish.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.380]   It's this interpretive stuff going on in there
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.300]   and that's what prefrontal cortex is about.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.220]   - Amazing.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.700]   It raises this question of cognitive flexibility.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:18.700]   Can we tell ourselves that something is good for us
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.020]   even if we're not enjoying it?
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.260]   Can we wriggle around these corners
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:28.260]   of choosing the exercise or doing the...
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:34.400]   I personally am not a big fan of long bouts of meditation
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.620]   but I've benefited tremendously
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:37.860]   from things like dedicated breathing
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.220]   and shorter rounds of meditation.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.740]   Can I tell myself that it's good for me
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.300]   and wriggle around the corner
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.660]   and get my physiology working the way I want?
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.540]   Do we have cognitive flexibility?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.000]   Can I be that third place runner and tell myself,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.560]   well, at least I came in, I wanted to win so badly.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.960]   That was my primary goal.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.260]   But another goal was to beat my previous time
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.380]   and I did do that.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:07.380]   And so, I mean, to what extent can we toggle
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.100]   this relationship between the prefrontal cortex
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.720]   and these other more primitive systems?
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.800]   - Oh, an enormous amount.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:23.260]   For example, being low in a hierarchy
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.100]   is generally bad for health
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.940]   and like every mammal out there, including us.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.340]   But we do something special,
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.040]   which is we can be part of multiple hierarchies
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.460]   at the same time.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.320]   And while you may be low ranking in one of them,
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.860]   you could be extremely high ranking in another.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.940]   You're like have the crappiest job in your corporation,
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.340]   but you're the captain of the team softball,
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.060]   of the softball team this year for the company.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.860]   And you better bet that's somebody
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.820]   who's gonna find all sorts of ways
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.300]   to decide that nine to five Monday to Friday
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.540]   is just stupid paying the bills.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.500]   And what really matters is the prestige on the weekend.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.500]   You're poor, but you're the deacon of your church here.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.140]   And so we can play all sorts of psychological games
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:07.980]   with that.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.620]   One of the most like consistent, reliable ones
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.980]   that we do and need to use the frontal cortex like crazy
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.500]   is somebody does something rotten
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.360]   and you need to attribute it.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.700]   And the answer is they did something rotten
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.980]   because they're rotten.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.800]   Always have been, always will be
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.220]   this constitutional explanation.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.340]   You do something rotten to somebody
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.340]   and how do you explain it afterward?
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.060]   A situational one.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.100]   I was tired, I was stressed in this sort of setting.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.260]   I misunderstood this.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.900]   We're best at excusing ourselves from bad things
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.500]   because we have access to our inner lives
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.260]   and we've got prefrontal cortexes that are great
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.340]   at coming up with a situational explanation
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.540]   rather than, hey, maybe you're just
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.860]   like a selfish rotten human and you need to change.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.020]   And that's all prefrontal cortex.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.620]   And we do that every time we don't let somebody,
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.040]   you know, merge in the lane in front of us
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.780]   even though you curse somebody who does the same thing
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.760]   to you and, you know, endlessly.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.140]   - I love it.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.060]   Your statement about the fact
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.140]   that we can select multiple hierarchies to participate in
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.880]   to me seems like a particularly important one nowadays
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.940]   with social media being so prevalent.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.340]   I know you're not particularly active on social media
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.100]   although you might be pleasantly, or I don't know,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.380]   unpleasantly surprised to find out
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.560]   that there's a lot of positive discussion
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.880]   about you and your work.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.220]   So you don't even need to be on there.
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.540]   We'll just continue to discuss your work.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:46.420]   But what's interesting about social media I've found
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.140]   is that the context is very, very broad.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:52.140]   I mean, one could argue that who one selects to follow
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.000]   and which news articles you're reading, et cetera,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.200]   can create a kind of a funneling of information
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.860]   that itself can be dangerous.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.220]   You know, more verification of crazy ideas
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.280]   or even just less exposure to new ideas.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.100]   But there's also this idea
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:11.060]   that social media is an incredibly broad context.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.020]   So as you scroll through a feed,
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.760]   it's no longer like being in your eighth grade classroom
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.580]   or your office or your faculty meeting.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.440]   You are being exposed to thousands,
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.900]   if not millions of contexts.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:27.200]   This meal, that soccer game, this person's body,
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.180]   this person's intellect.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.700]   YouTube is another example.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.060]   It's a vast, vast landscape.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.600]   So the context is completely mishmash.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.020]   Whereas I'm assuming we evolved, I think we did evolve,
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.460]   under contexts that were much more constrained.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.580]   We interacted with a limited number of individuals
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.780]   and a limited number of different domains.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.380]   Seasons tend to constrain us all.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.060]   And of course, then we got phones and televisions
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.140]   and this started to expand.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.820]   But now more than ever, our brain,
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:00.160]   our prefrontal cortex and our sense of where we exist
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.580]   in these multiple hierarchies
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.620]   has essentially wicked out into infinity.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.700]   How do you think this might be interacting
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.260]   with some of these more primitive systems
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.960]   and other aspects of our biology?
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.620]   - Well, I think what you get is in some ways,
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.540]   the punchline of what's most human about humans,
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.620]   which is over and over, we use the exact same blueprint,
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:33.100]   the same hormones, the same kinases, the same receptors,
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.440]   the same everything.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.940]   We're built out of the exact same stuff
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.020]   as all these other species out there.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.740]   And then we go and use it in a completely novel way.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.740]   And usually in terms of being able to abstract stuff
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:51.780]   over space and time in dramatic ways.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.020]   So, okay, you're a low ranking baboon
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.820]   and you can feel badly because you just like killed a rabbit
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.140]   and you're about to eat and some higher ranking guy
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.500]   boots you off and takes it away from you
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.740]   and you feel crummy and it's stressful and you're unhappy.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:12.460]   We are doing the exact same things with like our brain
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.940]   and bodies when we're losing a sense of self-esteem,
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.920]   but we can do it by watching a movie character on the screen
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.540]   and feeling inadequate compared to like how wonderful
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.060]   or attractive they are.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.460]   We can do it by somebody driving past us in an expensive car
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.440]   and we don't even see their face and you can feel belittled
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.920]   by your own socioeconomic status.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.000]   You can watch like the lifestyles of the rich and famous
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.700]   or read about what Bezos is up to.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:47.560]   And for some reason decide your life is less fulfilling
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.700]   because you didn't fly into space for 11 minutes.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.860]   And so you can feel miserable about yourself in ways
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.860]   that no other organism can simply because we can have
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.420]   our meaningful social networks include like the party
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.660]   you're reading about on Facebook that you weren't invited to
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.460]   because it's taking place in Singapore
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.860]   and you don't know any of those people.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.940]   But nonetheless, somehow that could be a means
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:18.440]   for you to feel less content with who you've turned out to be
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.520]   - Do you take steps in your own life
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.520]   to actively restrict the context in which you think and live
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.880]   and contemplate in order to enhance your creative life,
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:37.220]   your intellectual life, are those steps
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.600]   that you actively take?
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.640]   - Well, I very actively don't know how to make use
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.020]   of anything with social media.
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.980]   So I guess that counts as my having thus actively chosen
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.280]   not to learn how.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.780]   So that's the case, certainly for the last year and a half,
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.620]   like lots of people, I've gone through stretches
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.820]   where I've managed to sort of enforce a moratorium
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.440]   on looking at the news and that was wonderfully freeing.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   I think in the larger sense though,
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.640]   in addition to me being a neurobiologist,
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.440]   I've sort of spent decades spending part of each year
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.980]   studying wild baboons out in a national park in East Africa.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:24.260]   And I'd spend three months a year without electricity,
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:28.440]   without phone calls, with going 12 hours a day
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.560]   without saying a word to somebody.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.400]   And when I finally would, it would be somebody,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.280]   a nomadic pastoralist guy in a different language.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.100]   Yeah, I did 90% of my like insightful thinking
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.200]   about anything in the laboratory
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.000]   during those three months each year
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.100]   and not one in the lab and not one inundated with stuff.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.120]   - Well, I think there's sort of a shifting trend
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.940]   towards trying to create a narrowing of context
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.200]   that people, and I like what I see.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.920]   I have a niece, she's 14 years old
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.500]   and she and her friends are very good
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.160]   at putting their phones away.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.180]   They say, we're not going to have our phones
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.160]   for this interaction, especially after,
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.720]   and I realize we're still somewhat in this,
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.260]   it's unclear where it's headed,
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.540]   but 2020 was so restrictive
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.460]   and she was so separated from her friends.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.540]   Now it's let's really focus on being together
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.360]   and not bring in all these other elements from our phones.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.380]   And that brings me great hope for that generation.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.980]   Maybe they will, or who knows,
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.580]   maybe they'll run off and study baboons.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.800]   We need more field researchers.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.840]   So along the lines of choice,
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.020]   I'd like to shift gears slightly and talk about free will,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.720]   about our ability to make choices at all.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.860]   - Well, my personal way out
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.040]   and left field inflammatory stance is,
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.480]   I don't think we have a shred of free will.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.760]   Despite, you know, 95% of philosophers
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.740]   and I think probably the majority of neuroscientists
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.580]   saying that we have free will
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.420]   in at least some circumstances,
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.860]   I don't think there's any at all.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.860]   And the reason for this is you do something,
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.480]   you behave, you make a choice, whatever.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.500]   And to understand why you did that,
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.900]   where did that intention come from?
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.420]   Part of it was due to like the sensory environment
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.560]   you were in in the previous minute.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.380]   Some of it is from the hormone levels
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.420]   in your bloodstream that morning.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.340]   Some of it is from whether you had a wonderful
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.000]   or stressful last three months
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.460]   and what sort of neuroplasticity happened.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.580]   Part of it is what hormone levels
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.980]   you were exposed to as a fetus.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.700]   Part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:56.220]   and thus how you were parented when you were a kid.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.920]   All of those are in there
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.660]   and you can't understand where behavior is coming from
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.480]   without incorporating all of those.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.940]   And at that point, not only are there
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.860]   all of these relevant factors,
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.120]   but they're ultimately all one factor.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.300]   If you're talking about what evolution
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.060]   has to do with your behavior,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.200]   by definition, you're also talking about genetics.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.960]   If you're talking about what your genes
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.360]   have to do with behavior, by definition,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.100]   you're talking about how your brain was constructed
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.280]   or what proteins are coded for.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.800]   If you're talking about like your mood disorder now,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.960]   you're talking about the sense of efficacy
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.760]   you were getting as a five-year-old.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.040]   They're all intertwined.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.220]   And when you look at all those influences,
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:50.220]   basically like the challenge is show me a neuron
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.380]   that just caused that behavior
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.140]   or show me a network of neurons
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.860]   that just caused that behavior
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:59.940]   and show me that nothing about what they just did
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.060]   was influenced by anything from the sensory environment
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.160]   one second ago to the evolution of your species.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.140]   And there's no space in there to fit in
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:16.140]   a free will concept that winds up being in your brain,
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.440]   but not of your brain.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.960]   There's simply no wiggle room for it there.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.240]   - So I can appreciate that our behaviors and our choices
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.100]   are the consequence of a long line of dominoes
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.340]   that fell prior to that behavior.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.260]   But is it possible that I can intervene
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.120]   in the domino effect, so to speak?
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.520]   In other words, can my recognition of the fact
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.260]   that genes have heritability, there's an epigenome,
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.780]   that there's a hormonal context,
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.960]   there's a historical context,
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.820]   can the knowledge of that give me some small, small shards
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.380]   of free will, meaning does it allow me to say,
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.020]   ah, okay, I accept that my choices are somewhat
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.000]   predetermined and yet knowing that gives me
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.920]   some additional layer of control.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.380]   Is there any philosophical or biological universe
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.640]   in which that works?
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.400]   - Nah.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:28.780]   All of that can produce the wonderfully positive
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.920]   belief that change can happen.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.600]   Even dramatic change, even in the worst of circumstances,
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.620]   most unlikely people, and change can happen.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.800]   Things can change.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.820]   Don't be fatalistic, don't decide because we're mechanistic
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:48.380]   biological machines that nothing can ever, change can happen.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.380]   But where people go off the rails is translating that into
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:00.900]   we can change ourselves, we don't, we can't,
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.460]   'cause there's no free will.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:07.060]   However, we can be changed by circumstance.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:12.060]   And the point of it is, like, you look at an aplegia,
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:18.020]   a sea slug that has learned to retract its gill
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:20.780]   in response to a shock on its tail.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.660]   You can do like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning on it,
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.940]   and it has learned its behavior has been changed
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.100]   by its environment.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.060]   And you hear news about something like horrifically
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   depressing going on and, you know, refugees and wherever.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:45.820]   And as a result, you feel a little bit more helpless
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.900]   and a less of a sense of efficacy in the world.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:53.240]   And both of your behaviors have been changed.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.160]   - Okay, okay, yeah, I guess that,
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.160]   but the remarkable thing is it's the exact same neurobiology.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.380]   The signal transduction pathways that were happening
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.380]   in that sea snail incorporate the exact same kinases
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.300]   and proteases and phosphatases that we do
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.180]   when you're having mammalian fear conditioning
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.060]   or when you're learning it's conserved,
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.920]   it's the exact same thing.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.720]   It's simply playing out in obviously
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.140]   a much, much fancier domain.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:31.140]   And because you have learned that change is possible
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:36.280]   despite understanding mechanistically
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.660]   that we can't change ourselves volitionally,
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.340]   but because you understand change is possible,
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.980]   you have just changed the ability of your brain
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.580]   to respond to optimistic stimuli.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.120]   And you have changed the ability of your brain
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.300]   to now send you in the direction of being exposed
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.560]   to more information that will seem cheerful
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.120]   rather than depressing.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.900]   Oh my God, that's amazing what Nelson Mandela
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.900]   and Martin Luther King and all these folks did.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.460]   Wow, under the most adverse of circumstances
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.800]   they were able to do.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.920]   Maybe I can also, maybe I can go read more
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.420]   about people like them to get even more data points
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.580]   of change to neurochemistry
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.500]   so that your responses are different now.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.660]   And you're tilted a little bit more in that direction
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.620]   of feeling like you can make a difference
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.320]   instead of it's all damn hopeless.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.440]   So enormous change can happen,
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.040]   but the last thing that could come out of a view
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.620]   of we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.620]   and its interactions with environment
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.380]   is to throw up your hands and say,
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.580]   and thus it's no use trying to change anything.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:53.220]   - So we can acknowledge that change is extremely hard
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.340]   to impossible, that circumstances can change,
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:59.800]   and yet that striving to be better human beings
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.560]   is still a worthwhile endeavor.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.860]   Do I have that correct?
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:06.940]   - Absolutely, because simply the knowledge
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.860]   either from experience or making it to the end
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:14.000]   of the right neurobiology class has taught you
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.940]   that change can happen within a framework
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.680]   of a mechanistic neurobiology.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.840]   You are now more open to being made optimistic
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.060]   by the good news in the world around you.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.680]   You are more likely to be inspired by this or that.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.500]   You are more resistant to getting discouraged by bad news
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.060]   simply 'cause you now understand it's possible.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.680]   - Yeah, somebody who spent much of his career
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.500]   working on the hippocampus, I have to assume
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.940]   that you are a believer in neuroplasticity,
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.780]   that neural circuits can change in response to experience,
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.780]   and that some of the same so-called top-down mechanisms
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.940]   of prefrontal cortex that we were talking about before
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.000]   can play a role there, that the decision to try and change
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.500]   and the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of experience
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.920]   can shape our circuitry and therefore
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.060]   make us different machines, so to speak.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.060]   - Yeah, and not only can, say, prenatal hormone exposure
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.100]   change the way your brain is being constructed,
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.280]   but learning that prenatal hormone exposure
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.520]   can change the construction of your brain
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.940]   will change your brain right now
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:26.160]   and how you think about where your intentions came from.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.080]   Wow, maybe that had something to do with it.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.600]   The knowledge of the knowledge
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.440]   is an effector in and of itself.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.860]   - That's such an important and powerful statement to hear.
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:42.580]   I think that many people think that if a tool,
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   it doesn't involve a pill or a protocol, that it's useless.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   And certainly there are pills and protocols
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.660]   that are very useful in a variety of contexts
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:57.900]   for a variety of things, but the idea that knowledge itself,
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.620]   or as you put it, knowledge of knowledge, is itself a tool,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.100]   I think is a very important concept
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.060]   for people to embed in their minds.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.040]   And listen, I'm so grateful for this discussion
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.120]   and for you raising these topics.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.140]   I think that people, many people know your work
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.720]   on testosterone, on stress,
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.900]   and we've covered some of that today.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.780]   The work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:27.060]   or that we are in total control,
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:30.220]   I think I'm realizing in listening to you
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:35.220]   that neither is true and that the solution resides
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:39.700]   in understanding more about free will and lack of it
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.980]   and also neuroplasticity.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:47.260]   You're working on a book about free will.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.820]   Are you willing to tell us a little bit about that book
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.280]   and where you are in that process
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.900]   and what we can look forward to?
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:56.080]   - Yeah, it's going really slow.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.420]   Title is "Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will."
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.640]   And essentially the first half of the book
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.920]   is trying to convince a reader,
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.760]   okay, if not that there's no free will whatsoever,
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.360]   but at least there's a lot less than is normally assumed.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.660]   And I'm going through all the standard arguments
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:22.140]   for free will and why that doesn't make sense
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.940]   with 21st century science.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.260]   And that has led to reading a lot
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.320]   of very frustrating philosophers
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.020]   who basically are willing to admit
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:39.040]   that stuff is made out of like atoms and molecules
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.100]   and like there's a physical reality to the world.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.200]   They're not just relying on magic,
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.180]   but that they believe in free will for magical reasons
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.100]   and where it doesn't make sense.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.780]   Okay, so the first half of the book
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.220]   is to hopefully convince people
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.980]   that there's much less free will than they used to think.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.900]   And then the second half is this gigantic juncture
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.920]   built around the fact that I haven't thought
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.020]   there's any free will since I was like an adolescent.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.240]   And despite thinking that way,
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.460]   I still have absolutely no idea
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:14.480]   how you're supposed to function with that belief.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.100]   How are you supposed to like go about everyday life
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:23.160]   if anything you feel entitled to isn't true,
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.620]   if any angers and hatreds you feel aren't justified,
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.480]   if there's no such thing as appropriate,
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.940]   blame or punishment or praise or reward,
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:33.840]   and none of it makes any sense.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.180]   And somebody like even compliments you on your haircut
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.480]   and you've been conditioned to like say,
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.140]   "Oh, well, thanks as if you had something to do."
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:45.180]   How are we supposed to function with that?
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:51.620]   And so the second half is wrestling with that.
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.940]   And what the punchline there is,
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.060]   is it's gonna be incredibly hard.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.820]   And if you think it's gonna be hard
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.660]   to subtract a notion of free will
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:07.460]   out of making sense of like serial murderers,
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.380]   it's gonna be a thousand times harder
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.220]   of making sense of when somebody says good job to you.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.980]   And 'cause it's the exact same unreality
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.380]   of sort of our interpretations,
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.640]   it's gonna be incredibly hard.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.480]   But nonetheless, when you look at the history
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.480]   of how we have subtracted the notion of agency
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.700]   out of all sorts of realms of blame,
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.320]   starting with thinking that witches
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.460]   caused hailstorms 500 years ago,
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:45.460]   to the notion that psychodynamically screwed up mothers
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.400]   caused schizophrenia, we've done it.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.600]   We've done it endless number of times.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.720]   We've been able to subtract out a sense of volition
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.720]   in understanding how the world works around us.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.940]   And we don't have murderers running amok on the street
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.420]   and society hasn't collapsed into a puddle.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.160]   And in fact, it's a more humane society.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.480]   So the good news is it's possible
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.660]   because we've done it repeatedly in the past,
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.720]   but it's gonna be hard as hell.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.900]   And it's hard as hell to try to write
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.100]   about that coherently, I'm discovering.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.740]   So it's going slowly.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.460]   - Well, I speak for many, many people
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:29.740]   when I say that we're really excited
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:33.860]   for the book when it's done and we will patiently wait.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.460]   But with great excitement for the book "Determined,"
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.900]   you said is the title, correct?
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.980]   - Yeah, "Determined," the science of life without free will.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.960]   Seems like you can't publish a book these days
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.660]   without a subtitle, so that's it.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:49.740]   - Fantastic.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:52.340]   Well, very excited to read the book.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.740]   Very grateful to you for this conversation today.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.620]   I learned a ton.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.100]   Every time you speak, I learn.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.020]   And for me, it's really been a pleasure
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.440]   and a delight to interact with you today
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.040]   and over the previous years, I should say, as colleagues.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.840]   And thank you again, Robert, for everything that you do
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.700]   and all the hard, hard work and thinking
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.740]   that you put into your work,
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.780]   because it's clear that you put a lot of hard work
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.100]   and thinking and we all benefit as a consequence.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.020]   Thanks and thanks for having me.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.220]   This was a blast.
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.500]   - Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500]   with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.160]   That's a terrific way to support us.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.420]   And for those of you that are interested
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:59.140]   in supporting research on stress, on sleep,
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:02.740]   and how to better access sleep and combat stress,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.740]   you can do that by supporting the research
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.080]   being done on those topics in my laboratory.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.120]   You can go to Hubermanlab.stanford.edu
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.800]   and there you'll see a tab entitled
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.480]   Support Research in the Huberman Lab.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:17.100]   So that's for work at the Huberman Lab at Stanford,
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.740]   not the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.300]   And there's a make a donation tab
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.580]   where you can make a tax deductible donation.
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.900]   And if you're not already following
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.420]   the Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:29.220]   please check out Huberman Lab on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.500]   On both those channels, I post information about science
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.740]   and science-related tools, anywhere from one to five minutes.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.900]   Some of that information overlaps with the podcast,
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.380]   but a lot of it is unique and different
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.340]   from the information on this podcast.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.220]   And last but not least,
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.020]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:47.600]   [upbeat music]
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.180]   (upbeat music)
