[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   James O'Leary, a listener from Georgia, writes in, "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.120]   Today I came across John 8 verse 50 where Jesus says that he is not seeking his own glory.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.320]   I was surprised. Jesus goes on to say that there is
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.120]   one who does seek his glory." I think this might be a reference to the Father.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.340]   So why did Jesus not seek his own glory when that is what the Father is seeking?
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.000]   Was this refusal to seek his own glory temporary?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.960]   Does he now seek his own glory? And what does this teach us about Jesus?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.560]   The heart of
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.920]   Christ's
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   redemptive work in coming to earth as
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.720]   the incarnate God/Man
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.680]   in order to save sinners by dying in our place,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.960]   the heart of this redemptive work is
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.800]   that Christ came to be
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   inglorious
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   for 30 years.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.720]   Inglorious, not glorious.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   Isaiah 53, 2, "His appearance was so marred
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.760]   beyond human semblance and his form beyond that of the children of mankind. He had no form or
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.160]   majesty
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.840]   that we should look at him. No beauty,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.960]   you could say glory, that we should desire him. He was despised,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.200]   rejected by men, a man of sorrows acquainted with grief, as one from whom men hide their
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.840]   faces. He was
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.040]   despised and we esteemed him not." Or as Philippians 2 says, "Though he was in the form of God,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.640]   he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.120]   slave. Being born in the likeness of man and being found in human form, he
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.160]   death." And then he adds,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.120]   "Even the death," and he means the utterly despicable,
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.520]   humiliating
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.600]   death on a cross, the most
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.960]   inglorious
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   experience a human could
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   have. So
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   Jesus
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.480]   steadfastly
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.240]   refused earthly honors and power and prestige and wealth and glory.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.120]   This was his vocation on the earth.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.480]   He came to be identified with sinners and to bear the suffering and the shame that was owing to sin.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.600]   On the other hand, he came to represent God the Father.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.680]   And so John 1 14 says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.920]   glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth." And he said to Philip,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." In fact, seeing this glory,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   this beauty of the Father's power and goodness and wisdom and love in and through the
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.720]   inglorious Jesus, seeing that was
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.080]   necessary for anyone to be saved. That's how you get saved.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.760]   This is what the Pharisees could not see, the glory of God in the
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.880]   inglorious Christ. This was the peculiar glory they couldn't see.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   "Seeing you do not see,"
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320]   Jesus said. This is what Paul said Satan blinds
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.720]   unbelievers from seeing. He says the God of this world keeps
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.560]   them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.840]   And when he means gospel, the gospel of the glory of Christ, he means the message of the horrible,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.880]   horrible,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.040]   horrible death of the Son of God on a despicable cross as
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.400]   the place where the glory of the love of God was shining most brightly.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.340]   So Jesus came to be inglorious, and he came to be
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.040]   glorious.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.720]   He did not seek glory, and he did seek
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.480]   glory. And the glory he did not come to seek, the glory
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.640]   he did not come to seek and didn't seek was the glory of this world.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.320]   So in Satan's final temptation,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.520]   he took him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of this world and their
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.440]   glory.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.600]   And he said, "All these I'll give you, and if you'll fall down and worship me."
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.200]   And Jesus said, "Be gone, Satan, for it is written you shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve."
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.320]   He said, "I'm not here to embrace the glory of the world." And the glory Jesus did seek
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.920]   was the glory of his Father,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   John 8, 49, "I
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   honor my
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.360]   Father, but"—
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.200]   this is key—"but" he didn't just seek the glory of his Father
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.920]   separate from himself.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.360]   That's what we do. We seek the glory of God separate from ourselves. He sought the glory of the Father
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.320]   beyond himself. The Father and the Son are not the same reality.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.000]   They are united in essence, but they're different persons. He sought the glory of the Father beyond himself and
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.400]   he sought the glory of the Father
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.520]   embodied in himself. He said, "If you have seen me,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   you have seen the Father." He knew that in seeking the glory of the Father,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.600]   he was seeking his own glory, but not the glory of this world.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.800]   He said, "I glorified you on the earth,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.600]   Father,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.440]   having accomplished the work you gave me to do, and now, Father, glorify me
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.760]   in your presence with the glory that I had with you before the world
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   existed," that he emptied himself of
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.480]   these outward displays of
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.880]   beauty and glory. So what does Jesus mean in John 8, 50 when he says, "I do not seek my
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.080]   own
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.600]   glory"? And I think he means two things. First, he means, "I do not seek the glory and wealth and power
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.520]   and prestige of this world. I am here to suffer and be shamed, not honored by the world." And
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.160]   second, he means,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.360]   "The glory that I do seek is
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.160]   my Father's glory,"
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.080]   which, for those who have eyes to see, is also my glory.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.680]   He does not
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.440]   seek his glory apart from the Father's glory.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.040]   He does not seek to be glorious with a private
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   glory, but only with the Father's glory embodied in his own
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.240]   person. So he says in John 5, 22,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.640]   "The Father has given all judgment to the Son that all may honor the Son."
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:37.240]   Honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.640]   the Father who sent him. And again, chapter 17, verse 4, "Father,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.880]   I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work you gave me to do. Now, Father,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.400]   glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed." So, no,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.160]   he does not seek worldly glory, and no, he does not seek
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.940]   private glory apart from the Father's
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.640]   glory. But yes, yes, he does seek
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:16.280]   his glory after his redemptive work is done, and this is the love that he pursues
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.580]   because this is the glory he invites us to enjoy forever, John 17, 24.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:29.740]   "Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am to see my
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.440]   glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world."
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:43.860]   Amen. What a day that will be. Thank you for making those connections, Pastor John, and thanks for the email and for your very perceptive

[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.900]   And Pastor John and I will return on Friday, and I think the next email on the docket is about the topic of personal
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   assurance, namely this important question of "How can I be assured of my salvation right now if
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.700]   perseverance to the end is the final proof?"
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.420]   That's a great way to ask it. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you on Friday.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:25.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
