[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   I look at the way that my ancestors would
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.060]   think about dharma, there are two kind of ways
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.040]   that we can look at success in life.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.200]   There's outer success, which is wealth and its status.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080]   And then there's inner success, which is truly,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.680]   are you enjoying what you do each day?
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.860]   The point of dharma isn't necessarily
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.640]   to shame outside success or to shame
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.920]   the idea of wanting nice things or having a career that
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.040]   is ambitious that other people respect.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.800]   What it is saying, though, is that we can get all that stuff
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   and still not feel inner success, which
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.880]   is really meaning and a sense of purpose in what we do.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.320]   And at a certain point in time, it
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.000]   can be very easy to be walking a path that doesn't actually
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160]   feel like your own.
