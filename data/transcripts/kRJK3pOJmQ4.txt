[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.180]   And last week, Pastor John,
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.320]   you shared with us 15 lessons on writing
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.200]   from your recent six week writing leave.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   And now it's finally time to talk about what you wrote.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.040]   So give us a little preview of your new book.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.400]   - So I started the six week writing leave
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.900]   with the expectation that I would write a book
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.080]   on how to use the Bible to the greatest,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   to get the greatest treasures out of it.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.940]   How do you look at the book and benefit from the book?
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.040]   I was a good five weeks into this project
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.180]   before I gave that up.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.080]   I thought that's where I was going.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.080]   And 90,000 words later, that's not where I went.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.180]   Here's how it happened.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.140]   I was writing and I thought,
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560]   well, I've got to at least say something
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.920]   at the beginning of the book
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   on how we know the Bible is true,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.920]   how we know it's the word of God,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.340]   how we can put any confidence in it
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060]   so that we're warranted in spending so much time
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.360]   trying to look at the book.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.000]   Well, that initial question took over.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   It just took over.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.440]   And that's what the book is about.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.700]   Now, if I were to title the book now,
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.700]   it would be "A Peculiar Glory," colon, subtitle,
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.760]   "How the Christian Scriptures Reveal That They Are True,"
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.000]   or something like that.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.960]   So, and this idea of a peculiar glory
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.120]   is the new and fresh thing.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.680]   So I tell my story in the book,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.600]   my story with the Bible,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.680]   my whole life from six years old until today
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.480]   on my life with the Bible.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.580]   That's a chapter in the book.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.520]   And the fresh thing about that chapter is
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.540]   I don't talk about how did I manage to hold on
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.480]   to a view of the Bible through college and seminary
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.000]   and German liberal graduate school.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.120]   And my answer is I didn't hold on to a view of the Bible.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.420]   A view through the Bible held on to me.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.320]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.520]   - I had this picture of, I'm inside an Alpine chalet
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.120]   and there's a masterpiece on the wall,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.880]   a Rembrandt masterpiece on the wall.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.760]   And that could be my view of the Bible.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480]   And can I hold on to my view that that's a masterpiece?
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   As everybody tells me, it's not, it's an ugly painting.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   And I can hold on, it's a masterpiece, a masterpiece.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.840]   Is that what happened through all those years?
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   Or did I walk over to the window in the chalet
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.720]   and saw the Alps outside,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.080]   so that the Bible became the window
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   and held me not by some view that I was clutching,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.800]   but rather it just continually revealed to me
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.200]   more of God so that I couldn't be let go.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.080]   So that's what is going on in that chapter.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.240]   And then I tackle which books are in the Bible,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.880]   the canon issue, the issue of do we have the actual words?
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   And I love some insights that I got there about,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.840]   I've heard people be so skeptical about,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.080]   ah, what difference does it make if you confess
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.800]   in your doctrinal statement that you have an inerrant Bible
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.280]   in the original manuscripts?
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040]   You don't have the original manuscripts anyway,
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   so what difference does that make?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.960]   So why do you have that in your confession?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.640]   Well, it is massively important
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.480]   that that statement be in the confession.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.240]   And I've got an analogy in there about email,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   original email that gets Xerox, that's not the right word.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   - Scanned.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.540]   - Scanned, thank you very much.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.400]   Well, scanners typically make mistakes.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.680]   They put two R's back to back,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   look like an M or two T's make an H or weak scanners.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   And so you send out this email to people
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.960]   and they get all these different versions
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.600]   because you scanned it on different days.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.260]   And does it matter that there's an original email back there
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.400]   with the instructions of how to get to the meeting place?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.680]   And of course, somebody who's got real savvy
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   about how scanners work, they put them all together
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.120]   and he figures out which mistakes they made
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.100]   and you finally can get back to the original.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.040]   It really does matter
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.640]   whether we have original manuscripts or not.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.260]   And then I write about another section
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.020]   on the claims of scripture,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.580]   even though my approach apologetically is not to say
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.540]   because the Bible says it's true, it's true.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.080]   You have to believe the Bible, it's God's word.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.020]   God's word said it is God's word
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.660]   and therefore you believe that.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.940]   That's probably true, it's just ambiguous
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.320]   because the question is how you know God's talking here.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.060]   That's the big question.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.740]   And that's what I turn to next.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.620]   And that's half the book,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.620]   the 150 pages on Edwards guiding me in two key ways.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.800]   Edwards was so burdened by how the Indians,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.140]   the Housatonic Indians could know the Bible is true.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.180]   When they're preliterate,
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.220]   they don't have any historiographical skills,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.220]   how could they know?
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.980]   And that drives me too.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.780]   I want to know what I can say to the missionary
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.320]   going to Papua New Guinea to speak to a tribe
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.960]   and speak to them from the Bible,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.120]   hold a big black book in front of them,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.220]   read from God's paper, God's book,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.780]   and have them be able to know that's true.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.480]   I'll stake my life on that.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   How can that be?
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.340]   That's what drove Edwards.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.460]   And the second way he influenced me was
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.480]   he took his starting point from 2 Corinthians 4,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.500]   4 to 6, where the God of this world
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.100]   has blinded the minds of unbelievers
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.220]   to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.860]   of the glory of Christ.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.860]   And that proved to be enormously influential
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.020]   in how I approached this.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.140]   And so maybe the last thing I should say
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.020]   just to give people a flavor is,
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.140]   I asked this question,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.140]   how do we know there is a divine revelation in nature?
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.740]   Which Romans 1 says there is.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.280]   And the answer is glory.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.900]   You exchanged the glory of God.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.000]   You didn't glorify me as God.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.900]   You should have seen the glory.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.520]   Second question, how do you know there's a divine person
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.960]   in Jesus, the Jesus of history?
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.880]   How do you know that?
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   How did John and James and Peter know this is God?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.720]   Answer, we beheld his glory.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.160]   Glory as of the only son from the father.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.120]   Third question, how do you know the gospel
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.960]   is a divine reality from God?
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   Answer, 2 Corinthians 4, there is a light of the gospel
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.900]   of the glory of Christ,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.980]   that when God overcomes Satan's blinding,
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.820]   you see the glory and you know.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.120]   And all I did was, in this book,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.160]   was ask the fourth question,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.200]   is that way of answering the question of nature,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.380]   Jesus, gospel, also apply to scripture?
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.880]   And of course, I'm not new in this
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.120]   because the Westminster Larger Catechism says,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.080]   how doth it appear that the scriptures are the word of God?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.380]   Answer, I'm gonna pick out one phrase, answer.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.900]   The scriptures manifest themselves to be the word of God
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.140]   by the scope of the whole,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.980]   which is to give all glory to God.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.280]   And in one way to see my book is,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.380]   I just tried to write 300 pages about that sentence.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.760]   - Wonderful, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.840]   I'm looking forward to reading the draft very soon.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.860]   And of course, it's early in the process.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.300]   And if we move forward and finalize the title
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.660]   and the release date and a publisher,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.900]   I'm sure we will have more details to come
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.500]   on the website, DesiringGod.org,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.840]   and through our social media channels as well.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.540]   So you can stay tuned to future details on the book project
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.060]   through those mediums.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.100]   Tomorrow, we have a question
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.620]   from a newly married listener named Sarah,
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.300]   who is wrestling with 1 Corinthians 7
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.580]   and asking whether or not the apostle Paul
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.860]   has a low view of marriage.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.520]   Pastor John will tackle a very hard text tomorrow
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.500]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.460]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.620]   (silence)
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.780]   (silence)
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.940]   (silence)
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:33.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
