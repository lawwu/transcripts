[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Hi, this is Jeremy Howard and this is episode one of my new podcast, Their Life and Work.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.240]   In this podcast, I'm going to be interviewing people who inspire and interest me.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.840]   I want to find out all about their life and work because I'm just fascinated by these
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.600]   interesting and inspiring people.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.280]   Why do a podcast?
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.640]   Well, partly I guess it's a bit of an excuse, an excuse to talk to people that I really
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.960]   want to talk in depth with.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.000]   But partly because it's kind of how I've lived my life, I always look for things that are
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   interesting and inspiring to do on the basis that maybe other people will find the work
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.760]   I create interesting and inspiring as a result.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.320]   So I figured, yeah, if I find these people interesting and inspiring, maybe some of you
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.400]   will as well.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.940]   I've been lucky enough to meet a lot of fascinating people in my life.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.600]   And I guess that's because I've had a perhaps unusually diverse background in terms of what
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.000]   I've done and where I've been.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.880]   I founded five successful companies, two in Australia and three in the US, including in
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.880]   medical AI, a company also called Kaggle in the data science space.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.000]   And nowadays my focus is in deep learning.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.080]   I run a research lab called Fast AI, as well as also being a honorary professor at the
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.680]   University of Queensland.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.480]   I spent 10 years of my life recently in San Francisco, although originally I grew up in
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   Australia to where I've now returned and yeah, certainly got to meet a lot of really interesting
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.100]   people during that time in San Francisco where interesting people seem to flock, which is
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.040]   something really great about it.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.720]   Because I'm a dad of a seven-year-old lovely girl who we homeschool.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.280]   So you'll probably get a sense that the kind of stuff I'm likely to be interested in talking
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.200]   about during these podcasts, the kind of people I'm likely to be interested talking to might
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.580]   skew a bit towards folks involved in AI and tech and startups and education and homeschooling.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.240]   Which has lots of links into my first guest.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   So for episode one, I'm going to talk to one of the most inspiring people I know and his
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.600]   name is Tanishk Abraham.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   Tanishk is only 19 and yet he's already achieved an extraordinary amount in his life.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.080]   I feel sure he's going to achieve a whole lot more in the coming years and so I feel very
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.480]   proud that I almost get to be like his first biographer here, telling you a bit about this
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.760]   amazing person and how he's got to be where he is.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.280]   So what makes Tanishk interesting?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.160]   Well I mean apart from anything else, consider who he is right now and what he's doing.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.720]   He's 19 years old and he is about to finish his PhD which is quite extraordinary.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:52.400]   And he is about to start his first job as the founding CEO of MEDAC, a very hot medical
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.060]   AI research group, connected to stability AI.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.880]   You might have come across them through all the recent kerfuffle about stable diffusion,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.560]   the very exciting models that can create pictures just from a description.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.200]   So Tanishk is doing very exciting research and very exciting work.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.360]   His research is in the area of applying AI to medicine and specifically to medical imaging
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   in pathology.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.640]   This is an area I've actually done quite a bit of work in myself.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.040]   So I've got a lot of connections with Tanishk, not only because he himself was homeschooled
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.800]   and I'm now a homeschooling dad so I'm very interested in that aspect of things.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.240]   Also the fact I started a medical AI company, in fact the first company to focus on applying
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   deep learning to medicine and this is the area of his research and the area of the company
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.440]   that he will be the founding CEO of very soon.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.600]   And also the fact that actually the way I first got to know him is that he was a student
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:08.060]   of FAST AI, the courses that I create through my research and teaching group, fast.ai.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.240]   And so I was quite struck when I first met Tanishk a few years ago.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.600]   He was one of the youngest people to be doing our courses, our courses are really actually
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.360]   quite advanced and they're generally designed for people with quite a bit of background
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.440]   in computer programming and a pretty solid understanding of mathematics.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.920]   And here he was blitzing our most sophisticated courses as a teenager, in fact probably he
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.400]   must have been maybe 15 or 16 at the time so that was very striking.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.160]   And then I discovered that he's actually at that age he had started doing a PhD in an
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.480]   area I was very interested in with a very interesting supervisor actually somebody who
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.600]   I had already known and spoke to during my work.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.240]   So I was very privileged to get to meet him and I will say over the years that have passed
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:14.440]   since then I've really been amazed to see how he has matured into such a thoughtful
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.120]   young man and I have the privilege of now getting to work with him and we do research
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.120]   together.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   So if you're interested in finding out more about what makes somebody like this tick and
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   how do they get to be in such an extraordinary position at such an extraordinary age then
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.640]   you will definitely enjoy this interview.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:49.400]   His story starts in a sense actually when he was much younger he was actually getting national
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.720]   attention even as a nine year old.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.080]   He did some amazing things as a very young chap.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   For example here he is giving the youngest ever talk at NASA.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   My poster topic is about using citizen science programs and studying the number of topography.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:21.640]   The two citizen science programs I talk about is Moon Zoo which is from Zooniverse a citizen
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:29.560]   science web portal and Moon Mappers which is from Cosmo Plus a developing citizen science
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.240]   web portal.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.040]   So by the age of nine Tanish could already been doing some college subjects for a couple
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.960]   of years and this definitely came to the attention of a bunch of folks and as a nine year old
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.080]   in fact he was profiled in a YouTube series called Prodigies.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960]   Here's a clip from that to get a sense of what he was doing back then.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.640]   We finished chapter 20 but it's a very important chapter so let's review that today.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.040]   So anyone can tell me what are the main types of galaxies?
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   Elliptical.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.400]   Elliptical galaxies and spiral.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.520]   About one year ago Tanis became my student in astronomy 300 and he ended up the class
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.960]   being the student with the highest grade.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.040]   Which ones are the most common ones in the early universe?
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.200]   What about today and what kind of galaxies do I find most often?
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.160]   How many people do you know at the age of seven or eight they can discuss the expansion
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   of the universe?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.720]   He is different in a positive way.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.080]   The most fun thing for him is learning so sometimes when people ask what do you do for
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   a fun time?
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.160]   He says I just learn and then people just can't understand that.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.920]   Tanish was in my geology lecture and lab class at American River College.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.200]   Professor Stirling is actually the one who helped me get into college.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.080]   I've taken Tanisha into my wing because he has such potential.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:06.160]   His challenges are that he is at an intellect level here but yet he's still a very kind
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.760]   and happy eight year old.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.640]   Another thing that really brought him to the attention of folks all around America as a
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.000]   nine year old was he was part of the TV show called Child Genius.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.520]   Here is Tanisha being introduced on Child Genius.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.960]   So here's my actual high school diploma.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.240]   When you meet your competitors though are you going to hide and let you graduate from
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   high school?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.320]   Why should I keep it a secret?
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   It's already like almost everybody knows it.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   Yeah since I just graduated from high school President Obama sent me a letter.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.320]   We're running a workspace and room space here putting up all his trophies and newspaper
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   articles.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.800]   Joking me we say we need a museum now for displaying all these things.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.280]   He started taking college classes when he was seven years old.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.720]   I started going to American River College I've got almost 45 units.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   I may only be 10 but I've done some really cool stuff.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.800]   His appearance on Child Genius even ended up with him appearing in talk shows such as Conan
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   O'Brien where he got to show off some of his science jokes.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.080]   You have jokes you have them with you I'm told.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   You brought some jokes.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   Yes I brought some jokes.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.240]   This will be the first jokes we've heard tonight.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.120]   Let's uh let's uh can we can we hear your jokes okay so these are the kind of jokes
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.640]   you like because they're about yeah I've got some science jokes so okay all right let's
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:53.560]   hope you understand them okay the first joke is okay so why can't you trust atoms why can't
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:05.520]   you trust atoms I don't know because they make up everything but I think part of what
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   has made Tunis such a tough and tenacious young man is that his interest in learning
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.720]   required fighting at every step there seem to always be this assumption that any kid
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.600]   who really wants to learn must have no life elsewhere or must be getting pushed around
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:36.360]   by their parents or whatever he gave a Ted talk as a kid in which he started to talk
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.920]   about some of this here's a sense of of what he was dealing with when I started out at
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.360]   seven taking college classes was just for fun later on I decided to get an associate
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:58.600]   degree in science and then transfer to a four-year university as an advanced education student
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   you can only take up to two classes per semester and you'll last on priority for registration
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:12.320]   it's a struggle getting into the classes you want so far I've completed about 30 units
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.160]   but I still have trouble convincing colleges that I'm old enough to become a full-time
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:26.840]   student I wonder why that is well here's a reason I hear often I should enjoy childhood
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:35.020]   and have fun for me learning about particle physics is fun but I have other kinds of fun
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:41.600]   as well in reality I'm the one constantly reminding my parents that I want to learn
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   more and more now the reason I'm inspired by to niche is not by what he did as a ten
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:58.120]   year old by but by who he is now he's somebody I work closely with we chat many times every
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:07.020]   week and I've known him for quite a few years and he's one of the most tenacious and hard
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:17.500]   working and thoughtful people I know and so I thought yeah I can't think of anybody better
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.560]   to start this podcast series with and I think hopefully by the end of this interview you'll
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.920]   have a sense of why this is somebody that I really wanted to get to know and to more
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:33.200]   deeply understand their life and work so without further ado here is my interview with Tanisha
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:41.400]   Abraham all right hello and welcome Tanisha Abraham thank you so much for joining us you
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.920]   are my first guest on this podcast which is both a blessing and a curse a blessing because
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.480]   you're the first guest on the podcast and a curse because every podcast looks back to
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.200]   episode one and says oh my god all the things I got wrong back in those days so thank you
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.120]   for helping launch us and being a bit of a guinea pig here well yeah thank you for having
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.000]   me it's a I'm very excited for this and yeah be hopefully be a very fun experience and
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.320]   hopefully there'll be many more episodes to come up so well maybe this would be so good
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.960]   that people will be like no you don't need to do another episode that was the atomic
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   ideal of a podcast interview and everything down downhill from there so just stop yeah
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:34.640]   so Tanisha yeah I mean just tell us a bit about what you're doing in your life right
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:46.240]   now yeah so I'm a PhD candidate at UC Davis in biomedical engineering my research is focused
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.480]   on applying deep learning to microscopy and pathology so you know medical AI applications
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:01.840]   and yeah I've also been working part-time at stability AI also working on various AI
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.640]   research projects and medical AI projects yeah that's kind of where I am right now it's
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.680]   been quite busy but also very interesting and exciting to be I guess working at the
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.920]   forefront of AI research so I think that's very exciting and of course when you say PhD
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.860]   you know you're actually getting pretty close right so yeah yeah I'm planning to finish
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.400]   sometime around May so that's the plan so it's coming really close it's like you know
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.600]   six months from now so you know it's like oh yeah time was starting to kind of wrap
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.920]   up is like trying to finish up the papers that I have it's like so it's yeah it's it's
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:49.760]   getting close yeah well congrats and good luck on that so at the if you do finish in
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:58.360]   May how old will you be at that point? I will still be 19 so my birthday's in June so be
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.880]   right before my birthday so I'll still be at 19 so yeah okay so yeah I mean everything
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:13.560]   you described you know makes you a very interesting person to talk to from a vocational point of
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:22.840]   view anyway but doing doing all that at the age of 19 I think is particularly interesting
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.440]   and I both like do you want to talk about that but almost also kind of don't I do in
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.880]   the sense that like I do think it's really interesting and I think I would love to hear
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:45.080]   more about it but I also don't want to pigeonhole you being like yeah you know you're you know
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:51.120]   X I guess you're not a child anymore so X child genius slash prodigy but like yeah the
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.320]   work you're doing is just to be clear I think it's extremely valuable and interesting independently
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.720]   of the fact that you're 19 but it's particularly interesting if you're 19 if that does that
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.960]   make sense? No yeah that makes a lot of sense like I mean I kind of struggle with the same
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.400]   thing it's like yeah like this part of the apartment is like yeah like I guess I'm kind
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.560]   of known for this sort of you know how I've been as a child prodigy or whatever but then
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:29.120]   also like you know kind of want to also be known as you know this you know good AI researcher
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.560]   or a good yeah just a good researcher you know making you know yeah making a difference
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.840]   that way so but like I also appreciate the sort of background and a half right so it's
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.920]   like the sort of balance of you know yeah I guess who I am as a person like like yeah
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.760]   and how I represented it's like so I think there's a kind of a balance there where like
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.520]   yeah I definitely don't want to be pigeonholed it's just you know but like also yeah yeah
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.840]   I mean also and we'll talk about this more later but like I get the impression that you're
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:10.400]   very much a product of or a proud part of a family unit which has been you know very
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:16.480]   much a part of your path to this point you know and your sister is also doing amazing
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:23.760]   things and in a sense to kind of wipe away the fact you did all this at you know at a
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.840]   young age would almost be to ignore the amazing work and support that your family is provided
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.680]   does that yeah yeah I mean I think I think my parents kind of that's kind of the perspective
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.080]   that my parents have I think on this thing so there's also yeah I mean of course they've
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.120]   you know they've nailed a lot of sacrifices and they've put in a lot of work to help me
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:52.480]   reach where I am right now so and the same is true of course of mine for my sister so
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.500]   I think yeah you know they're also you know very proud of of the accomplished accomplishments
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.400]   that we've done it's to young age so yeah that's a that's a that's definitely a huge
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   factor and I think yeah it's of course let's let's talk about your sister for a moment
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.840]   so yeah so yeah what's your sister's name and what's she doing and how does she and
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.400]   yeah tell me tell me about that too yeah my sister she my sister's Chiara Abraham she
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.240]   is a she's 16 years old and right now she's doing her master's at Indiana University in
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:37.600]   both the performance and so yeah she you know she's she's also kind of a job she's a job
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.480]   biology in her own right in terms of she's been singing since she was about like maybe
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:49.080]   like five years old and you know she she's gone with professional vocal training and
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:55.000]   you know she's sung in many different venues she's for example sung the national anthem
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.600]   at you know very like at the Giants game S of Johns and you know at various different
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.000]   locations and then she's sung at different concerts and like of course like Carnegie
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.680]   Hall and in there's like the there's this big music hall in Austria music behind it's
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:22.320]   like various halls that she's she's also sung and yeah she's she's a very good singer she's
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.200]   interested in opera singing so that's kind of what she's pursuing right now at Indiana
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:35.360]   University Jacobs School of Music it's like one of the the best music schools in America
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:41.320]   for especially for the sort of opera music so you must be very proud of your little sister
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:47.480]   Tanishka yeah yeah it could see I'm just talking on and on about her no that's great I love
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:54.440]   it I mean yeah I yeah of course I I met you guys and your parents when you came to San
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   Francisco and I remember that was actually because Tiara was yeah looking at like where
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.040]   where to go to school I think you might have been looking at Berkeley as well at that time
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.960]   yeah at that time she was actually looking for her undergrad school so yeah that was
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.800]   in 2019 yeah and I remember saying to you guys like oh you know where should we meet
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.000]   and I was like oh I really like bubble tea should we go to bubble tea and I swear both
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.160]   of you guys to your eyes lit up with like oh we love bubble tea yeah yeah I mean we
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:34.400]   love the boba tea and it's like yeah we we really enjoy that it's funny actually I only
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.520]   started like we first had our like first boba tea like in 2018 or so like off right out
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.720]   of mine was like yeah we should go try it it was like and it's like amazing yeah so
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.400]   like a lot of times we look if we are traveling around and we see a bubble tea location we'll
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.360]   we'll give it a try I gotta admit I thought it was the weirdest sounding thing ever and
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:02.560]   I ignored it for a very long time yeah we're at tea with like tapioca that yeah balls yeah
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.520]   no not for me but it's fine because the tapioca balls are like the best part of it it's like
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.480]   oh yeah I like getting all the tapioca balls and like of course absolutely and just the fact
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.960]   you've got these awesome straws that are tapioca yeah it's great and you know generally bubble tea
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.280]   places also have extremely evil fried food options as well which is always always good
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:34.080]   so to be clear um yeah I mean for people that don't know uh I uh I'm a university professor
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:41.920]   that works in Tunisian field um very closely actually the Tunisian field um so not just AI
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.400]   and not just deep learning but specifically having done not just work in medical AI but
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:56.080]   quite a bit of work in microscopy so we um we chat nowadays what four days a week you know
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:04.640]   about a work we're doing which is super fun um and it's like one of the delightful things about the
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:13.920]   world that we're now in that we get to have this amazing you know collegial relationship despite
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.480]   the fact we we live in different parts of the world we're very different ages we're very different
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:28.080]   life stages we don't work for the same companies at all like I don't know I guess like maybe you've
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:34.560]   almost grown up with that or or does that strike you as kind of like amazing and unusual as well
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:43.840]   well yeah I don't know I guess I mean I think yeah part of it is just the power of technology
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:50.720]   and part of it is just me also like I'm just like always trying to reach out to people and try to
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.040]   interact with lots of people from different backgrounds so like that's kind of the thing
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:01.200]   that I enjoy so um and that would have been harder a few years ago you know when
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:10.320]   we didn't have that the accomplancing and yeah so but yeah I mean I think yeah I think yeah
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.560]   especially since the pandemic and all this video accomplancing has happened that has definitely
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.360]   opened up more opportunities for this sort of work yeah and of course like even the opportunity
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.920]   for remote jobs and things like that like I'm working part-time with this with this AI company
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.800]   and you know I'm obviously working remote like the company's technically based in UK but like the
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.760]   entire company like most of the company and like all the almost all the researchers are like in
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.280]   various different parts of the world and and that I don't I think they kind of came about because of
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:50.080]   you know um I guess it was like a lot of these AI communities kind of sprouted during this uh
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:57.440]   you know pandemic and so a lot of these kind of uh open source decentralized communities it
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.400]   only happened because of the pandemic and I think at that time a lot of us were bored and you know
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.920]   interested in like you know what could we do and so that that kind of led to this whole you know
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.240]   oh you know decentralized community happen these sorts of communities happening and now that that's
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.520]   become kind of the norm now which is yeah I think it's a great thing well I know for some people
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.360]   but I mean I think for a lot of people listening to this it wouldn't be very normal at all I mean
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:30.640]   for me it's like been normal for a long time my first company Fastmail was well you know my my
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.280]   school old school friend who I started with with it was local but everybody else was spread around
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:42.800]   the world and we had all just met over the internet that was I don't 1999 um we I'm trying
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:49.920]   to remember I guess we well a lot of the lot of us we never even really spoke directly over even
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.800]   Skype or anything it was all just text chat email that worked really well I've always yeah I've
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:05.120]   always liked being able to choose who I work with based on who's the best person to work with rather
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:12.880]   than who happens to live nearby you know yeah yeah the other thing I've noticed I at least for myself
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:21.680]   is like I find like you know I think asynchritists chatting or whatever it feels like sometimes it's
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.240]   easier to I don't know reach out to people and to like interact with the people and like I feel like
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   yeah well it's not of course that's easier that they're just available you can just send them a
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:41.520]   message and like yeah but it's like also like I don't know I feel like like it gives you more I
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.560]   feel like I'm more open to be able to you know interact with people like this like otherwise I
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.840]   may may feel like you know I think especially with platforms like discord and things like that because
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.120]   like right emails I think the thing is like things like emails feel very like professional you kind
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.520]   of like have to be like you know you want it to be all professional but there's something like
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.760]   these sorts of platforms like discord and I guess there you know other different platforms like that
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.000]   it's like you can just like quickly send them a message I mean it is particularly discord right
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.120]   like that's I think yeah yeah I think it's particularly discord and let's so let's just
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:20.400]   clarify so so the way you and I interact with our little community you know is
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:29.920]   we have a kind of a discord text chat where we we kind of you know because we're all over the world
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:37.840]   literally you know Africa Europe Australia US different time zones so we say oh here's
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:44.480]   something I tried here's some pictures of it here's a link to the code whatever and then we have our
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:52.640]   you know whatever for four days a week video chat and I do think that video chat adds a lot as well
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:02.480]   like I feel like it's I don't know I really yeah I really like that lower latency communication
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:10.880]   channel as well yeah yeah I mean just to be clear like it's not just us doing discord but like a
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   lot of these open source AI communities that plays discord and it's like um yeah like nowadays you'll
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.520]   see like cutting-edge research being shared in discord channels just like kind of like like it
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.800]   feels like now you know like I think it's normal but like when you take a step back you realize
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.520]   that's kind of absurd right like I mean not just read but developed so I mean let's talk okay so
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.200]   let's talk about I mean you were very very modest about you know this AI venture you're involved in
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   so to be clear the AI venture is stability AI and it's not just some hokey little thing it's
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:56.080]   actually I don't know I would argue it's maybe the most cutting-edge exciting AI startup in the world
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:04.560]   um it's and you're not just working there part-time you are leading the medical AI
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.640]   group there um it's like just getting that out of the way you're um but yeah it's kind of like that
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:18.000]   stability AI a lot of it happens over discord because the people are yeah they're all over
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.720]   the world and there's constantly folks saying what experiment they're going to try running or
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.880]   the results they've just got or so forth yeah I mean do you want to talk more about yeah what
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:38.800]   what that how that works and what that feels like yeah sure yeah like I think so
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:46.400]   with stability AI and the research groups under stability AI they're mostly these sorts of uh
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.840]   communities that are effectively you know for the most part just discord servers I think now
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.560]   as the company is growing you know there may be some aspects of becoming a little bit more formal
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.080]   but for the most part these are like open discord servers where you know pretty much anybody can
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.680]   drop in and um and they can help out as they want of course there are some people who are going to
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.320]   be employed by stability AI but there are other people who are just you know volunteering sharing
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.520]   their expertise so oftentimes you'll just have you know people they're often academics right
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.720]   who are kind of like yeah it's not exactly volunteering it's more like actively collaborating
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.120]   with people who aren't necessarily at the same university so like there are people who are
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.200]   completely new uh well not completely new I mean they still have some you know they're taking
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.360]   classes or whatever um but they want to get their hands dirty in actual research and they're able
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.160]   to get involved and you know work on research projects but then there are also people who are
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.640]   actual AI researchers you know academics or maybe even sometimes even people from AI startups or AI
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.760]   companies um and they're also able to get involved and um and help out you know and lend their own
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:02.080]   expertise um so it's like you know a mix of different groups and I think it's good that we
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.360]   have a sort of mix of different groups because you have different perspectives that you can get as
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   well and you know you know a very diverse set of perspectives which I think is very important for
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.720]   any sort of research project to be able to have that set of uh you know that sort of diversity
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.560]   um and I think that being open you know having a sort of open environment um through this sort of
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:29.440]   discord server really uh enables and fosters that kind of collaboration and diversity so like it
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.640]   seems to be working quite well um so there are a few um I mean I can talk a little bit about some
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:42.720]   of the research organizations there's in with your AI but let's let's come back to that later maybe
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   yeah um because um yeah I'm actually you know I feel like having got a sense of like
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:57.280]   what you're working on now uh at a high level I'm actually I want to come back to that but
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:04.400]   first I want to I'm really keen to learn more about you Tanishk okay um and I think a good way
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:12.880]   to find out about people is you know to do a bit of a biography you know talk about your your the
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:20.080]   chronology of your life which I'm sure will have lots of interesting facets but yeah first of all
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:28.320]   maybe you can tell me a bit about the family that you come from you know uh I I believe you were
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.160]   born in the US but yeah I mean we're you know where were you born or where did your parents come from
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:43.280]   and what were they doing with their lives before you came on the scene yeah sure um so um you know
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:54.240]   I'm Indian my parents are um both Indian born in India and um then uh first my mom's background
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:03.440]   so my mom's background is in veterinary medicine um my mom did her uh degree in India and then
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:14.560]   um and then my dad's background my dad technically did uh bachelors in um in
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:24.320]   electrical engineering uh but then uh right after my dad uh left university he got hired to do more
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.280]   software engineering stuff however since then he's been working in in software he must have been very
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:38.080]   quite an early software engineer yeah um do you know what he's working on um yeah so this is like
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:48.320]   maybe late 18 sorry late 80s early 90s yeah late 80s probably um okay so not too early then early
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:34:00.640]   yeah um so I forget exactly which which part of India which part of India was was that um so yeah
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:07.120]   both of my parents are from Kerala which is like the southern states yeah yeah kind of the most
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:16.480]   south state of India um and so yeah um like my mom went to veterinary school over there and it's like
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.960]   one of the leading veterinary schools in the country um and actually my my grandparents my
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:30.560]   mom's parents are also like they're also veterinarians um uh yeah um and they're also you know really
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:40.400]   accomplished people um like my my grandmother is like she was like the first woman veterinary
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.480]   phd or something like that or yeah yeah she she was like I'm kind of also like a trailblazer and
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   then my uh my yeah also my grandfather um was oh yeah yeah my grandmother like apparently
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:02.160]   she like discovered a new virus and like yeah she she's done a lot of I mean you know work
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:10.640]   as well in veterinary medicine and um and also my my grandfather also um like then like I think
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:23.520]   yeah at one point uh my grandfather and grandmother they worked in Nigeria and so my my um my mom and
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.360]   our family were living in Nigeria for a few years but they were like they were like in the government
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.200]   like one of the like kind of like the top of like veterinary medicine in the entire entire uh
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:42.160]   entire country and they had really um you know so they're very accomplished people in veterinary
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.960]   medicine um you know and and so my mom was also kind of you know working at veterinary medicine
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:57.680]   or you know studying veterinary medicine um and then so then my mom came to the US and um
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   met my dad and got married and um then so my dad was working uh in software engineering for a bit
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.320]   um and he was working they were in upstate New York um which is like in Utica which is
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:21.840]   like like what brought them to what brought them to America oh well so my dad was actually uh
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:28.080]   we kind of was brought up in in America so like my dad like so my dad's family moved to America
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.920]   like when he was in like middle school or so uh so my dad so my dad was uh you know brought
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:40.400]   up actually in in America so my dad used to live in it sorry what um yeah what what prompted that
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.680]   move um i don't know exactly i think my so my grandma my my dad's mother or my grandmother
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:55.600]   she was working as a nurse in America um and yeah i guess yeah i guess for better opportunities uh
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:03.680]   yeah so they they moved to America um but then my mom only moved um after she completed her
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:14.560]   veterinary degree and um and then when she um came to America um she met my mom my dad and got married
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:22.000]   so um yeah and then so they were they were living in Utica which is like upstate New York really
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.600]   freezing cold weather uh then you know i think my dad's company i kind of i think at least i think
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:36.720]   that that facility shut down something like that so uh they were going they had to find a new place
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:43.200]   um and they were they were tired of the freezing cold weather so they were my dad managed to find
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:52.240]   a job here it remember yeah he found a job in in in Davis in California um and so that's near
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:59.120]   San Diego right oh that's near Sacramento so oh right i remember now yeah yeah so it's about
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:05.680]   inland from inland from San Francisco yeah it's about like in our northeast uh no yeah
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:14.880]   an hour northeast of San Francisco um and so yeah my my my dad found a job there in in Davis
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.120]   and and they found a house in exactly but well yeah they were personally living in an apartment
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:27.040]   and then they found a house in Sacramento so you know since then they've been in Sacramento
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:34.400]   so that's been about like 25 years or so something like that um so and my yeah well my dad has been
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.960]   working at yeah basically my dad's been working at this company for i guess i think this year
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:48.640]   was 26 years so yeah like 26 26 or 27 it's 26 years yeah 36 years um
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.360]   so what's your company for 26 years it's just like nowadays that is unheard of obviously
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:04.480]   especially in California and what is what is your earliest memory Tanishk my earliest memory
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:12.800]   um i mean i had like some really vague memories maybe like i don't know maybe like three or
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.680]   four years old like really vague memories but i think a lot of my earliest memories were well
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.440]   yeah i do remember like a little bit in preschool so i must have been four um so i do remember a
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:30.560]   little bit in preschool yeah tell me what do you remember about preschool oh well many of you know
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:41.760]   just like i guess playing playing around um like um i guess um i guess when my parents would pick
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.520]   me up from preschool um and just like i guess certain yes it's like very vague but still like
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:54.800]   i kind of remember it um yeah i think a lot of my memories are more more probably from
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:02.160]   the kindergarten onwards i think that's kind of where yeah yeah now okay so this is interesting
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:08.960]   so you went to preschool you went to kindergarten but i know in the end you um you did homeschooling
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:19.040]   right so when did that switch happen and and why yeah um so it needs like worth talking about like
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:27.760]   when maybe my parents realized i was i guess different or special or whatever um and how that
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:34.000]   kind of resulted like and how that affected my education um but like so like my parents realized
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.440]   i was different like from very early on i guess maybe you know when i was a few months old um
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.960]   because like for example my my mom would like test my comprehension so like for example reading
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.200]   picture books or like yeah showing picture books to me and everything's like that and my mom would
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.240]   like ask questions and stuff and i was able to like you know point at things and he kind of responds
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.880]   so like my mom was like yeah i'm not sure if this is normal for like someone who's only a few months
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.480]   old um and i guess it was i guess yeah it is kind of a little bit yeah it's interesting she figured
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:15.440]   out it's not you know because like um to me as a parent my daughter who's seven sounds like she's
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.480]   at a very similar level to where you were when you were seven which is like you were doing some
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.080]   college courses and my daughter Claire's also doing some college courses and so like i would
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:34.320]   say she's you know her academic progress recently has been unusual but i didn't neither me or my
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:41.120]   wife saw that at all early on and i have no idea that's if that's because she wasn't doing
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.880]   anything exceptional or just we had no idea what was normal um so it's interesting that your parents
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.240]   are able to recognize that it was it was unusual because as a parent you don't actually ask
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:59.920]   anything to compare to at least that's my experience yeah that's true like i think i think my dad was
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.880]   a little bit more like hesitant was like i don't know like you know all parents think their children
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:10.720]   are special right it's like so i think my dad was a little bit hesitant at first uh but my mom was
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.320]   like more convinced like yeah maybe there's something different and like so yeah and then
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:24.960]   eventually like so first of all like my mom was like doing her phd and and yeah my mom did like
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.040]   uh yeah my mom was doing my mom did like a master's degree at UC at UC Davis so um i guess when my dad
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:38.320]   my mom moved to to Sacramento and Davis uh you know my mom was able to do some uh studies there
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:45.280]   but like my mom was in her the middle of her phd um in veterinary studies yeah well it was technically
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:54.160]   like comparative pathology or something like that but yeah it was um yeah um but yes my mom was
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.040]   doing for phd when she was pregnant with me so originally the plan was just to take a few months
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:05.360]   off or like a year off or something like that and go back uh to completing the phd but then i think
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.480]   when my mom realized uh well maybe there's something special about about me or something different about
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:19.280]   me um that my mom decided to actually quit quit the phd and and become a a stay-at-home mom just to
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.720]   just to be able to support me and you know make sure i get the support that i need so i mean that's
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:33.120]   not like a really bold thing to do like i mean obviously selfless but like parents are expected
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.840]   to be selfless you know like that's you know um but yeah bold in the sense that like speaking as
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:47.520]   a parent from you know as soon as our daughter could go to a normal school which was rather
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.040]   delayed because of covid that covid would have been in the first year and all the schools were
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:58.160]   closed in san francisco we sent her to a normal school because that's what you do you know and
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.120]   it wasn't until we had like i don't know maybe it sounds really slow but it was like basically a
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:14.400]   year of realizing things like it didn't go terribly she was happy but it didn't go great and she never
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.480]   she definitely never learned anything and her only comments about the classes were that they were
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:27.680]   boring yeah yeah it was it was really a year of like not great progress that we finally thought
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:34.800]   okay maybe this is not the best environment for her so i mean yeah your mom yeah she really
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:43.280]   took a bold step very very early it's amazing yeah yeah it is kind of amazing because of course yeah
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:51.200]   like i think also you know my mom did definitely did have great career opportunities waiting
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   waiting for her if you know if that was something my mom wanted to pursue but instead my mom decided
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:03.280]   instead to to focus on on me at the time and of course my sister later on so yeah it is definitely
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:09.920]   a huge sacrifice on on her yeah but also a huge amount of self-confidence right because yeah it's
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.520]   hard as a parent i find it hard as a parent to do things that are like totally different to what
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:20.320]   everybody else in the community is doing because there's always for me the second guessing of like
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:26.240]   oh i don't like i don't want to do weird things and make my child weird and like not give them
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.920]   the best opportunities and so there's always this very natural draw towards like just doing what
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:37.040]   everybody else is doing the basis system can't be that bad so yeah i mean she had a lot of
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:49.280]   self-confidence to do something that is yeah it's unusual yeah yeah yeah that's that that is that's
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:55.840]   true yeah um and of course yeah i mean of course it's not just my mom of course my my dad also was
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:02.880]   after some point no my dad was also quite convinced too so yeah you know together as a as a family um
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.160]   and so initially did your mom have to convince your dad is that i'm you're understanding that
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:14.000]   i'm not entirely sure but like i i mean i've heard from my you know i've heard from them like yeah
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.520]   originally you know my dad was like maybe you know all parents all parents think they're
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.240]   their children are special maybe not necessarily but i think you know after maybe after a bit
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.200]   maybe my my dad i think you know of course they they did their own research in terms of like
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.320]   child development and things like that at that young age and i think from that point onwards and
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.560]   then also eventually this was like later on i mean wait that's i mean that's interesting that's
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.480]   already interesting because i mean it may sound like an obvious thing to do is to research
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.680]   child development and i certainly did a lot of research into child development but very few
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.800]   parents i've spoken to actually spent time researching child development you're like
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.440]   uh that's that's interesting i got what do you yeah what do you know about that what did what
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:06.480]   did they uh-huh what did they do a lot about that to be honest um um i think i think yeah i think
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.840]   they they did like thankfully of course we should all you know with the internet you know there were
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.440]   already some resources available and then i think they may have talked to one or two people i'm not
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   entirely sure honestly but then event i think eventually then they decided finally to do an iq
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.480]   test with me this was like when i was three or four years old so this was like a little bit later
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:36.240]   on but they yeah i think they just kind of wanted to like yeah but like my mom was like just doing
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.680]   this just to yeah our daughter didn't get one until she was six and it was only because her school
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:47.840]   told us they should do it and we're like uh why bother doing that you know but it actually looks
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.920]   really helpful yeah it's not like my mom needed that like to to be certain like i think it's more
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.760]   like also like certain so like for example we have like wanted to i think my mom wanted to
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.160]   get me into mensa at the time because my mom thought okay they might provide some you know
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:12.240]   useful resources and help with things honestly and so don't put right i mean you know so my mom had
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.560]   some high hopes about that so for that like that was maybe one of the reasons i think that my mom
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:22.400]   got like it just because they require those sorts of things uh but so like never just like yeah but
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.520]   so i mean of course that like definitely you know showed that i was uh you know confidently show
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.640]   you know yeah i mean let's talk about that for a moment but like so yeah sorry let's talk about
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.520]   that for a moment because it's like it's it's really something that really resonates for me
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:46.560]   as i say as a parent like so yeah for for our daughter her assessment showed she's in
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:53.840]   i don't know the top point oh oh i don't know how many ohs one percent yeah um and
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:02.240]   i kind of what felt like or wanted to feel like that doesn't matter i mean she was very
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.840]   um well adapted at school she had a lot of friends people liked her you know
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   one level everything seemed fine but at another level she was spending hours every day
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.600]   sitting in a classroom where she was learning nothing at all and she was just basically
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:26.080]   practicing learning how to zone out and always be right which i think is terrible
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.520]   psychologically to always be right you know because you need to fear being wrong um and
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:38.640]   you know the school had a gifted program that like is for the top 10 of students and it's
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.400]   like well what about the top 10 percent of the top 10 percent you know over there you're like
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.680]   they are different you know you like those those children have
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:57.920]   different needs not necessarily socially but bring you know to be challenged and to be
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:04.080]   you know what counts as compelling content so yeah i definitely feel like it's
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:13.760]   mattered for us in a way that i didn't at all expect almost comfortable with yeah i mean yeah
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:23.280]   like yeah i don't know like i mean yeah i don't i don't care about my i2 i don't think my parents
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:29.520]   like were that concerned about it or like you know they couldn't yeah it was just more i guess
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:37.360]   yeah for these sorts of things um and um yeah in terms of like i mean that's not something to be
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.800]   proud of but it's something that's definitely impacted yeah yeah exactly you know how you have
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.720]   lived your life and how your parents instructed your life so like clearly it it matters in some
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:56.160]   way right yeah i guess it matters but like yeah yeah yeah he's yeah that's right um but in terms
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.600]   of like yeah what my parents were like i guess yeah going back to like when i started going to
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:10.080]   like preschool and kindergarten like they wanted to of course challenge me um of course like
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.360]   socially you know i was they wanted to of course give that social development to me as well like
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:21.120]   you don't make sure have that social development so you know they try their best you know to to set
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:28.800]   up something special with the school so i think you know as much like at kindergarten um and then i
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.520]   think also so like in kindergarten i think also second grade so i actually skipped first grade i
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.360]   went to second grade so i think in those two grades like i was doing like this sort of like
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.960]   i would only go maybe two or three times a week um and that was mainly just for the social aspect
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.920]   right because i'm not like learning anything new yeah because uh it's amazing how similar that is
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.560]   to Claire she skipped prep once she took her to school and jumped into first grade although she
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:59.360]   was doing but then for math they put her in fifth grade isn't yeah you yeah yeah i definitely felt
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:05.440]   as parent like oh i don't want her to miss out on social development yeah so then yeah that's what
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.800]   they yeah that's what my parents started to do to still give me that social development so you know
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:17.280]   i still have five to have friends at school and um but then they you know of course at home i was
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:22.160]   studying my own at my own level um and then i would i would participate in some of those gifted
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.080]   programs like there was like a reading program where i would be again reading it like you know
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.840]   fifth grade level that i'm reading at when i'm in kindergarten uh similar with um you know math and
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.400]   and then also i think like when i was in second grade my parents were able to stop at the school
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.920]   something where like i would be i would go to like the eighth grade class for science or something
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   like that um was like participating in a few of their activities and stuff um so i'll tell you
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.800]   the challenge we faced with that which i'm guessing you might have seen something similar your parents
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:58.960]   might have seen something similar which is um you can put you know you can accelerate a kid
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:08.480]   to a higher class you know but it's not that that kid is like statically more advanced by x amount
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:15.600]   it's a you know pick things up quicker and so like at least with Claire she was put into grade five
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.000]   you know when she was meant to be in for bath when she meant to be in grade prep and for a month
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.280]   that was cool and she was interested and after a month she was bored again and like we didn't we
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.680]   didn't find any yeah these programs tend to be like kind of a static amount of enrichment on top of
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:37.840]   what they'd otherwise be doing but it doesn't seem to account for this continuous acceleration
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.480]   where they're doing like a year's worth of learning every month or two like that doesn't
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.240]   seem to fit very well with any of these programs yeah well the thing was like my parents tried to
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:55.520]   like do something very special and like very cheap like something catered specifically to me and they
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.560]   try to work that out with the school for a long time yeah it had a lot of meetings with you know
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:07.760]   people at the school but then eventually then the school was very at a certain point they they kind
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:16.000]   of weren't as flexible and they just kind of did not want to you know support whatever my parents
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.040]   thought would be best for me yeah but it sounds like that made quite an effort um they they kind
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.160]   of say the same thing about our child school like they're quite after yeah and they need some effort
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:35.600]   but again that was after a lot of my parents pushing them right like this was like my parents
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.400]   put a lot of work you know you know they had several meetings i mean i still kind of lately
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:46.480]   remember like some of the meetings but they were like really like trying to you know argue it out
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.760]   with some of the yeah the the the folks at the school yeah i mean that's such a common story
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:59.920]   i've heard so many parents say yeah they like the advocacy is exhausting and demanding yeah it is
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:07.760]   exhausting yeah i i remember that being the case for my parents and the only reason my my parents
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   kept me in the school was because of the social aspect of things but then as i so like the thing
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   was like with the second grade that the teacher was very supportive so that really helped then as
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:28.000]   advantage of third grade the teacher was not at all supportive yeah um and then some teachers almost
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.360]   seem to be antagonistic or threatened or something like some teachers really seem to react negatively
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.000]   yes yes i think they do feel kind of threatened that like they're maybe they're not like they're
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   not the ones who are teaching or like you know or like you know maybe they feel like yeah threading
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.040]   like oh this this is like a know-it-all kind of kid or something like that i don't know yeah i
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.160]   mean we had something like that with claire there was you know that her school on the whole was
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:56:00.000]   trying really hard and they there was actually a gifted program in high school that they put her
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:09.520]   into when math was too boring and yeah it's like oh this is cool you know like two two years of high
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:16.480]   school math in one year and maybe challenging and then there was a change of headmaster at the high
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:26.720]   school and it was weird the way he took this like personal interest in like getting rid of our
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:34.080]   daughter out of school it's like yeah he sent us this email and like and like send an email to the
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:40.800]   primary school and yeah he just seemed really offended by the fact that there was a young child
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.400]   studying math in his school in a way that i just i didn't understand how he was thinking about it
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:53.440]   yeah yeah some people are like that and i think that's what happened in third grade and yeah like
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.200]   like the second grade teacher was very supportive and i think some of the folks at the school were
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.240]   supportive but then i was going into third grade i think they're also some of the the staff also
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.960]   changed and those folks were yeah less supportive they felt threatened and then also i don't know
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:16.320]   how you know what it is but like the you know the students also were very antagonistic towards me
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:22.480]   at that point and i was getting wow already at that age yeah yeah i was getting bullied i i mean i
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:28.080]   kind of remember like there were times where like for example some of the students would like steal
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:35.200]   my supplies um then some of them would like try to like like they would quiz me like mental math
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.960]   and like if i didn't answer they're like oh you're not smart or things like that and like i'm a kind
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   of person who's like actually pretty bad at mental math to be honest i think that's like one of the
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.840]   things i'm not very good at so like you know you know that's that was you know not a very good yeah
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:58.080]   it was very i guess yeah the entire environment kind of became toxic um and i was not enjoying
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:03.040]   going to school like before i used to like enjoy going to school you know i had some friends you
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.920]   know i thought it was you know it was just for me to have fun i mean third graders must be learning
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:13.840]   this attitude from somewhere right like yeah exactly yeah that's where that i think i think
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.520]   part of it does come from both you know the parents maybe you know there's some aspect
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:23.200]   from the parents again from the staff the teacher i don't know uh but i think there there's of course
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:31.040]   some aspect where it's like yeah they are learning it you know from from yeah other figures yeah so
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:35.600]   at that point like i was not enjoying going to school yeah no okay i can i can get why your mom
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.880]   did homeschooling at that point because yeah sounds like this is not working out
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.120]   at all exactly i mean they tried their best to get it to work but if it just didn't work so they
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:51.040]   were like yeah we're we're gonna take him out of school and and homeschool him so let me just just
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:56.720]   let me just take a diversion for a moment then just because i've been as i said studying a lot of
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:04.400]   the research around education and child development and um as i expect you know the the reality is
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:12.880]   that on pretty much only any socialization or social measure homeschooling kids on average
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:21.520]   come out ahead of kids that go to normal schools um so you know that's that that that's the other
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   thing when when we were like oh maybe we should homeschool Claire it's like oh no what if she
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:31.840]   turns out to be some kind of weird freakoid who doesn't know how to deal with people that's not
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.960]   what the research shows at all yeah um and indeed you don't seem to have come out as a
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.280]   weird freakoid freakoid you can't deal with people or if at least if you are you seem to be able to
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:48.560]   hide it very well yeah i mean that man definitely been like the complaint everyone says it's like
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.960]   you look at like like that's like what like especially when i was younger that was like one
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.840]   of the you know questions like everyone had one about his social skills and like like you see like
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   any interviews you look at like the comments on any of these interviews like i mean obviously i don't
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.040]   i'm not affected by any of these comments or anything but it's just kind of funny to just
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.640]   see like everyone's like what about his social skills i'm like you don't need to worry about that
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:20.960]   but yeah um i think like so when i was yeah when i was younger of course they uh my parents had
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:28.240]   given me different opportunities for social skills so like i used to i used to go to uh the
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:35.440]   san francisco boys chorus i was in in the chorus for quite some time um so i had you know you know
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.640]   that was that was happening while i was homeschooled um and so that i got you know that was one
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.800]   opportunity for me to socialize but then i think it's also like i guess i didn't have any issue
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   like like as i started a college and stuff like that i didn't have much issue socializing with
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.280]   people who are like twice my age or three times my age right right and like why you know a couple of
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.880]   questions like why would we assume that the best people to socialize with the people whether you're
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.120]   saying chronological age yeah that doesn't happen in adulthood we're all kinds of different ages
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:21.200]   and and b why would socializing well with seven-year-olds be an important skill within year 18
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.920]   like yeah there's a lot of assumptions in there that don't make sense to me and so like yeah
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:33.840]   homeschooling kids generally seem to have a much wider age group or diversity of people they hang
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.720]   out with rather than people yeah exactly their exact chronological age and go to a school with
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:46.800]   the same religious profile or whatever as you know everybody else yeah yeah that's definitely
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:53.440]   an important point like when i went to so i started out in a community college which is like
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:00.960]   at in in u.s that's like the sort of like two-year college uh but it's usually like a lot of times
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.000]   it's not only like students in so sometimes students in high school will be taking college
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.360]   classes there sometimes after high school they'll spend a three two years in this college and then
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.480]   go to complete their remaining two years at a regular university then also there's a lot of
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.040]   students who are coming back for like continuing education and things like that so a community
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.960]   college has a very diverse group of people you know you have students who are like high schoolers
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.040]   uh you know so they're and how long earlier when you were starting to go to this community college
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.720]   i was seven years old seven okay yeah so then they were you know standing through like in the early
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:44.560]   teens all the way up to people who may be in their 60s 70s uh so you have this very diverse
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:52.160]   group of people very diverse ages um and so can i just ask something about this just sorry to
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:59.120]   interrupt i just wanted to make my guess would be tell me if i'm wrong all right that you wouldn't
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.640]   have had the same problems with bullying as a seven-year-old at a community college because
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.880]   the other kids would have probably seen you more as like a adorable little kid rather than a
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:18.160]   threat or something and i would imagine they were on the whole pretty pretty nice to you was that
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:25.840]   yeah um for the most part the students were pretty nice to me um i think
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.320]   i think um also like it was more like i think yeah a lot of students just thought um
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:40.160]   i think you know you know i'm the kind of student who's very engaged in the class and you know
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.720]   studying very well and so they also thought of me kind of just as a probably good student in the
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:51.600]   class and you know interacted with me accordingly um occasionally you'll have students who did feel
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.840]   maybe a little bit threatened that happens occasionally um but you know i try to avoid
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:04.320]   that as much as possible but for the most part yeah something less i got um over bullying like
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.640]   i had in in third grade or whatever yeah i i got a bit of an insight into your experience as a
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.600]   seven-year-old because we're lucky enough that you have a recording of you as a nine-year-old
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:24.240]   describing that experience um and a ted x talk and i think one of the things that really struck
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.600]   me or there's a couple of things that really struck me but one was how much again advocacy
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:41.040]   was required by your parents to get somebody to agree to teach you yeah yeah um yeah can
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.440]   you talk a bit about i mean obviously it wasn't you doing that but like what's your memory of
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.520]   that or what have you yeah about that from your parents and what what what what was it like to
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:56.320]   get because okay just to be clear my understanding is as a seven-year-old you were a very good college
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.320]   student like you got a's and top marks and so yeah maybe talk a bit about like yeah what kind
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.280]   of results were you getting but then what was the experience like of actually getting to attend these
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:14.960]   classes right yeah so again at that point it was again my parents are trying to challenge me and
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:24.160]   you know keep me uh you know yeah you know try to academically challenge me um so they thought you
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.680]   know at the time i was interested like in of course i was already kind of interested in science you
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.640]   know i was interested in like paleontology astronomy so they were looking for and like
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.600]   you know i was dinosaurs in space are always good kids things yeah absolutely there's still
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.840]   like an aspect of me being a regular seven-year-old who loves like dinosaurs in space well of course
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.000]   that's the thing right our daughter's the same she's such a regular seven-year-old she likes
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:00.560]   fairies and unicorns and spaceships and imaginary animal friends yeah yeah yeah i mean i think yeah
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.120]   the difference is like i took it a lot farther than like a regular you know seven-year-old like
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.320]   i was like really stunning everything about dinosaurs and everything about the maze our
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.440]   daughter has watched the entire professor dave astronomy video series like i don't know five
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:21.920]   times and she's always quizzing me about main sequence stars and brown clouds and i'm just like
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:29.680]   slightly picking things up but yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah i remember some of that from my
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:36.720]   astronomy days yeah um so yeah i think i think so at the point was like the point was like
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.400]   i had gone through a lot of the material that is available for kids my age even like you know kids
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.360]   ordered me in terms of like reading books about dinosaurs and things like that you know even
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.040]   starting to maybe get into a couple of papers and things like that so they figured you know that a
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.920]   better way to potentially challenge me was you know going to college and i mean i had also asked
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.640]   them about this too this is something that i had myself asked about um you know this is something
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.000]   that i was you know interested in as well um and so you know in fact at first they didn't take me
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.480]   very seriously oh this kid wants to go to college that doesn't make any sense but are they being
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.280]   your parents or they being yeah yeah my parents like even they were like at first uh i don't know
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.360]   like sure you're advanced but you know you're still seven i guess at the time i'd asked i
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.840]   was maybe like five or six and they were like yeah that's real a bit weird i guess yeah it is
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.200]   kind of weird so um but then i think they they noticed like you know i'm still like kind of
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.400]   study this as much as possible and i you know college would be a good opportunity for me to
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:46.000]   you know pursue this further and you know i was asking them relentlessly about this um and so
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.560]   eventually the again contacting some professors as you can imagine most of the professors said no
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:03.840]   they managed to find one professor who uh said said yes um and she agreed to have my mom as a
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.760]   student in the class and then i just would be part of the you know just you know going along with my
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.280]   with my mom so i wasn't actually at that point an official student i was just with my mom was a
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:22.000]   student and then uh he would so i was just sitting in the class then when it came to like things like
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.680]   quizzes and exams just for fun he would give me those quizzes and exams and i would take them
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:34.400]   and you know i was getting eight grades in all the quizzes and exams now so he was very amazed by
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:40.560]   that i don't know these topics are largely like kind of more like rote learning really aren't they
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:46.000]   often yeah so this was a geology class so you know there was an aspect of it that is rote learning
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.040]   but also like i think there's still some aspect of it that's understanding you know the geological
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.080]   processes and how how how they work and how they interact but for yeah there's a lot i guess my
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.120]   point being like i find that for a lot of the stuff Claire's doing i actually feel like a lot of seven
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:06.880]   year olds could do it because you know it's it's you know like i mentioned to you the other day
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.320]   she's doing biochemistry at the moment and yeah it's largely college level material some of it's
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.720]   actually beyond college level material like chirality and stuff i think normally you tend to do
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.440]   post-grad is my understanding um and yeah she had to like learn the amino acids which yeah
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.080]   i think you know she learned some fast i didn't know this stuff either and she learned them faster
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.200]   than me but it's not surprising because you know the young brain does learn things faster than
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:40.800]   an adult so like i do think that this might also be partly a general thing as kids can perhaps learn
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:49.200]   more than we expect yeah that's probably true i think i don't yeah i don't know like you know what
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.720]   kind of skills are required at these different ages or like or you know develop at different ages
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.360]   there may be some skills but yeah i mean of course a lot of the memorization is possible
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.240]   at a young age probably yeah maybe i can come back to this topic i'm really interested in talking
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.800]   about it more because um i don't know i just think it's really fascinating but yeah i don't
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:15.280]   i also don't want to interrupt your your story so yeah yeah do go into about your college experience
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.720]   yeah and so yeah i was like yeah basically i was in this geology class and um you know
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:28.640]   taking a lot of the exams and quizzes and he was you know very uh impressed and uh i think so you
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.480]   weren't really officially there you it was really like your mum's doing it and get old she has to
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.800]   babysit the kid basically yeah basically like um i guess i was presented but yeah yeah but it was
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:51.040]   actually secretly it was for you yes exactly yeah um so then i think so at that point and then she
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.720]   he was also kind of helping out and becoming an advocate for me as well in terms of like
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:03.200]   okay this is a kid who i think can potentially join this college and take some college classes
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:13.520]   what was his person's name um stephen stirling he was a he was a geology professor um and yeah
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:23.280]   so i think he's retired now but yeah he uh so yeah he he he really was helpful in terms of like
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:30.080]   talking with the the college staff and helping to convince them but even then they of course the
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:36.320]   college staff were still not that convinced they were like they kind of they were like you have to
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.160]   do well in these classes otherwise we will not let you continue so like i think the expectation
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:49.520]   was like getting an a basically in the classes is that a higher bar than other students would have
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:57.600]   had or probably i mean probably yeah um i think so yeah so for a while that's kind of what was
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.200]   happening and then also they limited me to only taking two classes per first semester so i was
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:10.080]   only taking two classes per semester um and so and then basically every single semester there was a
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.080]   whole process like i had to go and meet the dean and get permission from the dean and it was a whole
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:23.200]   process um and it was like a very special uh situation but eventually like so like i wanted
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:30.320]   to take more classes and progress faster yeah i mean two classes on the semester is not a lot not
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:39.040]   yeah it's not particularly um yeah it's not particularly engaging i guess um so the so the
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.280]   idea was then um i would graduate my school so then then i would be regular college student so
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:52.560]   this is around the age of nine or ten then i i managed so luckily in california they do have
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:00.000]   this option to like um take a a standardized test and test out of high school but you can
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.800]   only take it if you are in 10th grade so they they they we have to set it up i wonder why
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.760]   these limitations exist where they came from because somebody obviously proactively decided
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:19.360]   you should create this gate it's it's interesting and i think it's again like they think like oh
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.120]   you have to be you have to go through a certain amount to to have that development that they
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:33.680]   deem necessary i guess um i think that's what it is um but so yeah they had to like we need to like
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.760]   set it up in a specific way such that i was like officially technically in chance grade and then
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.920]   eventually i was able to take that test yeah we we had to yeah there was a way that we we had to
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.080]   like yeah set it up with some school or something yeah it was it was another whole process um and
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.400]   then eventually i was able to test out um and um and so that's some specific californian thing that
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.120]   yeah yeah i think the californian are you effectively basically just doing the year 12
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:07.200]   exams and the normal year 12 exams and it's not just i don't think it was a normal year 12 exam
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.000]   it was specific towards testing out like i think the idea is like so like they want they'd be allowed
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.200]   for like grade 10 and 11 students to test out of of high school actually so this is a test for these
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:25.920]   sorts of grade 11 and grade 10 and 11 students um so it's kind of more uh catered towards that
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.440]   particular i think there's a separate test for actually for regular grade 12 testing out uh
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.680]   but they but luckily like i mean that's kind of still like a benefit of california like i don't
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:45.120]   know if other states actually have this sort of uh before yeah i'll ask you about something which
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:52.880]   is um i wonder if you had to deal with this at that time you know but um a term that's very
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:59.040]   often used by psychologists in the field of like you know more advanced kids or whatever
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.400]   is um asynchronous development and so asynchronous development refers to the idea that
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:15.360]   some kids you know develop surprisingly quickly in certain areas but not in others you know so for
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:22.080]   example for kids that who would often be described as gifted which is not a term i love but i guess
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.120]   it's a term that's reasonably when i'm stored the asynchronous development often is like okay
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.960]   their handwriting's crappy because they're not particularly physically capable their understanding
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:43.440]   of you know complex social political etc situations as you might come across in like a
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:51.360]   shakespeare play don't really exist you know but they have maybe very good understanding of
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:02.880]   spatial reasoning or or abstract manipulation or whatever um so yeah so in in our life that's
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:11.280]   that asynchronous development is the big challenge because like i don't feel like i would want player
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.680]   doing a you know year 12 level english exam where she was expecting to read
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:25.840]   you know books like othello or something um because they're just not age appropriate they
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.720]   you know like reading comprehension okay should get it should be fine but like she's she's a
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:41.360]   little kid no yeah um and she certainly couldn't do the handwriting necessary for a normal like
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.720]   three-hour exam or something so yeah did you have to deal with those kinds of things or or
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:52.160]   with the california and stuff mainly more like modable choice analogy tests and stuff
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.800]   so the california test was yeah more more like that i think there's maybe an essay or something
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.760]   like that but for the most part it was um mostly they're just testing your knowledge and things
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:09.120]   like that um but overall of course my parents are what were careful about what was age appropriate
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:17.040]   in terms of like classes and things like that um like even like for example english classes
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.360]   you know they would review the books you know making sure they're age appropriate
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:30.000]   you know certain you know there were certain classes like um yeah they're different classes
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   that you know my parents you know they would talk to the professors and also just clarify
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.720]   what the professor is if there's anything to be you know to be careful about and you know
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.760]   like maybe there are times when like the professors would show something and you know i would step
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.720]   out of the class for a bit while they're showing something that maybe wasn't wasn't the most age
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.280]   appropriate so like they you know there was definitely that aspect uh in terms of like
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:05.120]   what was age appropriate for me at the time um but apart from that like again of course
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.760]   like handwriting you know was also something i like struggle with um but i think that was more
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.960]   like i do have like some sort of like issue with with my hand in terms of like i don't know yeah
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:22.480]   i have some you know issue like especially for writing very long periods of time um i i much
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.960]   prefer typing and things like that i mean yeah i've absolutely yeah it's always the same and we
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.480]   actually got out we got our daughter typing we got our daughter typing like when she was five i guess
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:40.800]   and it's been such a great skill for her to have because there's so many things she can now do
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:48.720]   despite her asynchronous development because yeah little little kids can type that was not
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.040]   necessarily an asynchronous thing it was just more like i think i do have like i tend to have
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.240]   like pain or something like this i don't know some it's more like i think um yeah i don't think that
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.000]   was like a development thing that's just kind of something with my body or whatever uh so how did
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.080]   you throw that essay um well i don't know like i don't know if i had i thought there's something
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.400]   that didn't get like accommodations and things like that in terms of like specifically uh for
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.920]   this sort of issue i don't know if i had or not my child is sure but australia there's like a
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.200]   specific list of things that count as accommodations you know and they're but and like they're
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.400]   disabilities you know and you have to be able to show that it's like a due to an illness so although
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.480]   like having tiny seven-year-old hands is a disability but at least in australia
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:44.960]   it doesn't count as one because it's not due to an illness okay oh interesting okay well it was
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.880]   yeah and over here they counted as a disability actually when i when i have it that makes much
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:55.760]   more sense yeah um but like overall like apart from like age-appropriate stuff like you know
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:01.120]   being careful about that for the most part like and yeah i guess what they have thing is really
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.840]   not asynchronous development but apart from that for the most part like in terms of development
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:12.160]   like for example i was oh like my attempt was like 11 i think or so like there was one
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:18.400]   i took an english class and we went over like i think it was the tempest or something like
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.640]   that so i was like already like reading like shakespeare plays or whatever um and i didn't
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.360]   have that much issue with those sorts of things yeah i mean the tempest is not a particularly
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.760]   i don't know like yeah it feels like a pretty still very dense accessible story
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:44.480]   but yeah like rell and juliet or something or if hello or something might be hmm tougher i think
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:53.840]   but yeah i don't remember anything yeah go ahead what about um what about math so um
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:09.760]   yeah like math is needed for a lot of college level you know um stem stuff yeah well not just
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:18.480]   stem but also social sciences as well um so yeah what were you doing about that we used you know
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:25.520]   studying more advanced math and like calculus and trig and stuff and what you know was that
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:32.720]   like mainly your mom teaching you or how did math work um so like when i was younger um like
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:39.280]   again six or seven years old it was mostly my dad my dad is the more i mean my dad is a software
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.480]   engineer and of course he's he's more you know engineering background he's he was able to teach
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:52.720]   the the math aspect of things um so i'm yeah my dad would help me out then teach me and they were
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:58.160]   like different programs that you know i was i was going through in terms of um you know learning
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:03.920]   you know i think yes at the age of five i was doing again like fifth grade sixth grade math
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:10.480]   but then i would continually progress i think by nine or ten i think by nine i started like
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:17.120]   starting dibbling you know dabbling and and calculus and that kind of level stuff but then
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:22.080]   like i started taking classes like it's like even online classes and stuff and like pre-calculus and
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:28.000]   i think maybe even some con academy videos things like that so i was like so then by by 10 which is
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.640]   when i also graduated high school i went into um yeah i started taking i took a proper calculus
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.720]   class i mean i already studied like calculus on my own stuff like that but then i actually took
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   a proper college so what do you say on your own that would be largely con academy um yeah like i
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   think there was a maybe a book that i was reading and then there was like um there's like a corsera
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.520]   course i think yeah there was like this really nice corsera course that i took on single variable
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:04.320]   and multi-variable calculus things like that um so i think it was mostly single variable calculus
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:12.400]   so yeah i was mostly mostly taking just like yeah resources online things like that uh and so um
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:18.560]   and again like a lot of it is me like when i'm studying a lot of things it's like a lot of times
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:23.200]   it's like me like i have a goal in mind right so like i remember like when i was saying trigonometry
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.040]   i think this may have been the time of like the transit of venus or whatever and there was like
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.920]   the whole thing you can calculate the distance of you know the earth to the sun based on like
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.840]   you know the you know the time it takes for the transit and stuff like that and it's like
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.280]   there's a lot of trigonometry involved and so i was like studying trigonometry to understand
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.360]   that kind of stuff and then i was studying like calculus also to better understand some
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:50.000]   physics stuff so a lot of it is me i mean that's my like constant goal with teaching my daughter
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.440]   is trying to find those things where she can get to do it in context because honestly like she
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:00.880]   so i for math i teach her and one other kid her best friend and the best friend
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:09.760]   is totally happy to learn math for its own sake like he just has so much joy in being like oh i
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:16.720]   now know a new thing yeah and my daughter's not like that at all she just doesn't care
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:24.160]   until it's got a reason so we do a lot of um art of problem solving did that exist when you were
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:32.000]   i don't know i am i haven't done down it's it's amazing it's you know it's uh fantastic um it's
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.080]   basically kind of like designed as a kind of math olympiad prep but it's like 12 years worth
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.720]   of math olympiad prep if you know what i mean so it's like teaching the entire primary and high
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.320]   school curriculum right but on the assumption that the kids studying it are really interested in
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   solving challenging problems and thinking carefully about them and they're going to
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.480]   continue all the way through that's done in a very thoughtful way and um it's a great program but yeah
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:07.680]   my daughter's really not interested her friend loves it and then the other day i was like okay
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:13.440]   well you know for some reason oh that's right i was having trouble setting up a factorial computer
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.320]   game server for them and they were like why isn't it working and i'm saying like well it works if i
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:25.040]   put in an ip address but not a dns name for some reason and then and then players just like what
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.640]   exactly is an ip address so why you know i was like okay all right stop everything this class
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:37.040]   is going to be about you know ip addresses and we're going to have to do binary masks and we're
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:45.040]   going to do octets and uh you know and now she's totally into it and like at every step she's just
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.920]   like wait how on earth do multiple things go over the same wire like oh okay well that's
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.280]   multiplexing it's like what exactly is multiplexing how does that work and like oh well okay let's
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.280]   come up with a little simple algorithm that we could use for multiplexing and yeah with context
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:08.800]   she's just yeah all over it and without context she just that's okay so the interesting thing is
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:15.920]   like now i feel like i'm like before i came to math yeah i was more like i need to have an
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:23.120]   application or something to motivate that now i feel like i'm kind of interested in not just
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.640]   for the sake of it sometimes so i don't know like at a certain point i think that in a certain age
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.400]   i guess that that maybe changed i don't know so i am slightly getting there i wouldn't say i think
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:41.280]   i'm still not quite there like i had to have math books now that i purchased for the enjoyment but
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:51.440]   they're generally were like you know using apl or they're like you know different perspectives on
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.880]   math or whatever i you know i'm not somebody who could just study a real analysis textbook
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:08.080]   and find that yeah a worthy thing to spend my time on yeah so yeah so i guess then i guess so yeah
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.200]   basically i was studying calculus and then uh but i still check out of like an official calculus
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.400]   college course and went through the calculus curriculum or the math curriculum at college
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:27.440]   so that included calculus one, calculus two, calculus three, then um i think what else then
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:34.880]   as i was finishing up at community college i took linear algebra and um yeah i took linear algebra
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.720]   and then in university i you know where i transferred over to the four-year university
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:47.520]   i took a differential equations class um and that was it in terms of like my yeah it just turned out
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:52.080]   to be very useful since we're spending so much time doing differential equations nowadays exactly
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:58.480]   yeah i mean funny there's so much stuff that i remember like in the world of math at school or
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.360]   university or whatever starting basically from trigonometry where you know we'd ask the teacher
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.880]   like what's this for and the teacher could never answer the question of like what's trigonometry
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:15.360]   for or what's differential calculus for or what and now yeah these things are everywhere like i
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.720]   you know use trigonometry all the time i'm and i'm like how do you do anything without trigonometry
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:28.080]   or without calculus but i think a lot of teachers just don't have that real world experience as
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.840]   engineers or scientists so that they genuinely don't know how to answer the question i think
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:39.040]   well it's going to be on exam yeah well yeah that's so like some of my classes did that was some of
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.920]   the classes really nice in terms of like you know providing those sorts of examples or like you know
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.080]   sometimes in the calculus textbooks they would provide you know actual examples of where these
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.440]   sorts of things would be used and i remember in my differential equations class uh the professor
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.120]   would start every lecture with like an example of you know the topic that we're talking about now
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.440]   like maybe it's a certain class of differential equations that we're talking about how was that
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.240]   how you know examples of the use of that in the actual world and so that's really really
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   helpful like really in terms of motivating why these sorts of concepts that's really rare yeah
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.600]   it is rare he's actually he's a really great professor actually and so who's that sorry uh
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.120]   my differential equations professor yeah what's their name oh uh villium tabernet he's at uc
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:33.760]   davis yeah yeah um i just want to come back to khan academy as well not just khan academy but
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:40.880]   like i've asked you previously when we've chatted about online resources and you've
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:47.680]   mentioned you use things like time for learning and khan academy did you find that that stuff
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:56.880]   you did on like khan academy or whatever like was was useful in preparing you to take stuff like
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:05.440]   calculus one and things like that um i think it helped like i never been doing like especially
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:11.040]   like geometry i think i'll explain some algebra and geometry i mean i i learned the concepts so i
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:17.440]   don't how long so i did the job definitely definitely did his job and so i also learned
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.640]   some i think it did some chemistry like i used to do a lot of yeah i i think there was a time in
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.720]   i'm used to like i think a nice thing about like these like khan academy and these sorts of lectures
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:32.080]   and stuff it's like it's very easy to to like devour a lot in a lot of a lot of content right
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.640]   and it's like just like watch video after video and like and you're just learning all of it and
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:44.000]   and so that that really helps and then i think nowadays they also have like quizzes and stuff
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.240]   and i don't know if there were quizzes back then i mean taking some of these quizzes and stuff that
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:55.200]   also was helpful by the way i um your recommendation of trying out time for learning was not so
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.720]   accessible i tried it unfair and afterwards i was like how was that fair what do you think
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:07.760]   and she just goes i think it's stupid but she never had strong opinions like that about stuff
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:15.040]   so i was like oh okay because like it's like i don't know i might have i might have picked bad
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.240]   examples i picked the middle school stem stuff or whatever okay having said that we have since that
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:29.920]   time found some much more engaging youtube videos from crash course and the sisters that actually
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.760]   are pretty terrific and i'm learning yeah crash course is really really nice as well like i
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   remember i mean i think i remember watching a lot of crash course videos i wish they had quizzes
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.000]   though like we always put everything we try to put everything into anki cards you know like
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.800]   most learning cards um which for math i kind of do it for them because no one remembers anything
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:59.760]   unless it's in anki card you know so yeah i wish there was like something like yeah crash course
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:12.560]   plus hmm anki cards for each lesson or something that would be amazing yeah um so okay so like i
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:19.280]   want to come back to your youtube talk your it's not youtube your tennis talk um so yeah as i said
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:26.240]   you know one thing that i've you know noticed very much was the struggles that you and your parents
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.840]   had in just getting somebody to agree to teach you like yeah i am an enthusiastic child who
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:39.520]   wants to learn yeah go to hell you're not old enough and then the second was the end of your talk
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.480]   was kind of like a plea to be accepted as
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:52.880]   you know a normal kid who
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:33:02.320]   isn't being forced to do things by a tiger mom and who just enjoys learning and like
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:08.400]   and we just actually all agree that's okay and i don't have to be demonized for that like these
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:15.200]   are not your words but i i almost felt like that's what you were kind of saying and yeah i wanted to
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:21.280]   hear about like what was driving that because i mean it sounds like even your parents might
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:27.680]   have been getting a bit like hassled in some way or like those assumptions that you were that they
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:33.600]   were driving you oh and like i remember you like showed pictures of like being outside and having
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:40.080]   parties and you're kind of like i don't just spend all my time indoors studying math you know yeah
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:45.280]   yeah so what what what happened is this some kind of like prejudice that you were like dealing with
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.360]   or you know what you do there is definitely like the sort of prejudice that or like the sort of
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:56.400]   assumption that yeah my my parents are pushing me or something like this uh could you give some
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:02.880]   examples of like yeah stuff that happened like that you remember and how that and how you felt
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.760]   at the time well i i guess not just yeah not just even my parents but like you hear often
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.200]   like a lot of comments are like you know and people are telling me straight to my face like
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:18.560]   you there's no need to hurry you know it's like like as if like this is something that
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:24.080]   i'm hurrying or anything like this is just me wanting to do what i want to do uh and it's like
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.200]   there's no need to hurry you know you can slow down those sorts of comments so there's that aspect
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.960]   of things from it's like kind of like from from teachers or friends of your family or what
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.880]   yeah i mean i think it's it's a combination of yeah like people who i you know even people who
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:46.320]   i meet for the first time sometimes they might say that you'll see it uh yeah sometimes teachers may
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:53.520]   say that sometimes and of course you know you'll see comments of course again you know i of course
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.040]   don't not like these sorts of comments i take your part or anything but it's just interesting to
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.840]   to see these sorts of like you know either the comments that i get from people in person or even
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:09.200]   the comments you see on the line must have been impacting you though like that you decided in this
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:15.360]   talk to like i think it's make this case i want to yeah i want to clear clear the air i guess
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:23.280]   right it's just like um certainly yeah i mean it doesn't like i'm not like saddened by it or
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.400]   anything like that it doesn't like you know affect me in that way i know like when people like read
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.800]   sometimes people read things like youtube comments or comments like that and they get really affected
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.640]   by it it doesn't it's not like that sort of effect it was just more like you know people and people
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.600]   are saying like yeah their parents must be pushing them more like you know you get like things like
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.640]   you know stereotypes about indian parents and things like that too right and it's like oh yeah
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:54.400]   bit of casual racism yeah yeah you know there's a bit of racism that goes in there too and it's like
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:02.800]   none of that is you know actually the reality in fact i think so let's talk about the reality so
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:10.400]   okay so you don't feel like you were in a hurry or you weren't being pushed to be in a hurry
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:19.360]   so like yeah what what was going on for you what were you trying to what were you trying to get
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.720]   out of your life i guess or get out of each day or how you know what were your priorities or interests
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:36.480]   i guess part of it is just like not being bored um like and um
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:48.880]   yeah were you bored sometimes sorry were you bored sometimes um i mean certainly when i was
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.600]   you know the younger like um i think definitely you know in the sort of elementary school and
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.000]   stuff like that it was definitely bored you know that was definitely a situation i remember Atlantic
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.440]   and you know sometimes they'll like give me tests and stuff and i'm sure i should pretty
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:09.680]   quickly i'm just sitting at the table doing nothing um so it was like um i have a feeling like
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:17.280]   being extremely bored for long periods of time as a very young kid with absolutely no way to avoid
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.760]   it could be very damaging i don't i don't have any data to back that up but it just feels like
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:30.880]   i feel like i've seen it you know there i mean there's certain well okay no that's not true there
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.920]   is some data to back it up i mean in a sense i don't know if you've seen the great research
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.200]   from Rurika Gross who's an Australian academic and unfortunately she recently passed away but
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.640]   she's one of the very few people that has done multi-decade longitudinal studies have
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:54.080]   we've found they gifted you know as they're called kids and kids who are left in their
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.480]   chronological age group class at school on average are in the bottom five percentile
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:06.480]   when it comes to social outcomes like they do very badly they tend to suffer depression
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:14.400]   at very high levels they tend to have very few friends kids the kids that are accelerated
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:21.200]   in by three or more grades on average are in i can't remember exactly i think it might be
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:28.880]   the top decile so maybe the top 10 of exactly the same metrics so like that that i mean i'm
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.480]   sure it's not just boredom but that certainly seems to align with the idea that leaving kids
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.520]   in an environment where they're bored just to keep them around kids of the same chronological
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:50.320]   age might be a bad idea yeah yeah um yeah i guess it's like this part of me that always like wants
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:58.400]   to do something like right like or like wants to um learn something wants to i guess we would do
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.680]   research like actually that was another thing like i think that was another thing like when i when i
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.080]   was in community college like this like it's always an aspect of really like always looking at what's
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.440]   you know what's what's the goal to reach right you know what is the um so i'm a very goal-oriented
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:20.640]   person so i don't know yeah like like you know that's a community college it's like okay i didn't
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.160]   what do i need to do to transfer to a four-year college but for university and especially at that
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.640]   time kind of my motivation was like the four young universities are like the best place to do
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.560]   research and i was like at that point like in community college i started getting into like
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.720]   okay like yeah i want to do some cutting-edge research now but like those opportunities aren't
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.040]   really available at community colleges so that was my next goal it's like let's go to four-year
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.600]   universities and then there'll be opportunity for me to do research and that and the four-year
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.640]   university i'm like okay now let's still i want to get to a phd so you know i can do even more
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.320]   research and uh and um so you had a strong sense of where you wanted to be you wanted to be doing
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.600]   cutting-edge research and there's there is a sequence of steps that have to be completed before
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.360]   exactly you can do that and of course i this is another thing like maybe this is something
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:17.280]   maybe worth touching on is like i know there you know the truth is like the sort of i guess path
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.680]   i've taken is still kind of conventional in a way right like i've still gone through like
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.520]   a four-year university and then a phd which i was gonna say i mean you're not like
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:34.320]   you haven't been in a hurry at all like it's been 12 years from when you started college
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:43.360]   when you're finishing your phd which is actually kind of slow yeah yeah um so there's definitely
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:52.400]   like a sort of conventional path that i've taken i think i mean that was the only thing i tell
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.480]   people like i think it also depends on the field like obviously i think there's some fields where
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.080]   maybe a conventional path is necessarily the best path so um but i think you know for the field that
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.600]   at least is sort of like um i guess i'm into this sort of biomedical engineering field
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:13.360]   unfortunately it's kind of hard to to do much work in that field if you don't have this sort
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:20.560]   of conventional uh background and so for us that is also about like you know you know just working
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:28.080]   with the system and trying to um you know try to i guess i one person was saying like i'm like
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.200]   hacking the system like trying to accelerate in the system so sometimes there's that aspect of things
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:40.960]   but yeah like i guess i think also the nice thing about a conventional system is you do have those
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.680]   goals and like again i work very well with having these goals so it's like you know you have those
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.200]   goals and it's very easy to to you know have that motivation to to meet those goals and
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:56.640]   so this is not that's another nice aspect of you know the conventional system but you know again
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:01.600]   it depends per person like i i i do realize there are some people where that sort of system just
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:10.000]   doesn't work um yeah what is it about biomedical engineering that makes like a more conventional
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:19.840]   path necessary i think there's again this sort of um so like yeah again it's this sort of thing where
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.360]   you know if you want the best career opportunities i think you have to have at least a bachelor's
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:31.760]   degree and a lot of the times you do need a phd and those are the sorts of backgrounds that of course
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:38.880]   um you a lot of companies will require or if you want to get into academia of course that's the
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:44.560]   standard path but then also uh but it's hard i guess depends on what your what kind of research
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:51.600]   you're interested in but oftentimes the research is done in academic labs or in in various companies
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.320]   so uh you know you have to be involved in that system to be able to get the hands-on experience
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.960]   so that that is a major challenge i think if you are maybe working in like biology and more of
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:09.360]   you know life sciences and things like that you do have to somewhat work within that system
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.880]   whereas something like computer science and deep learning and things like that
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.480]   it's definitely much easier to work outside of that system and you know you can change a more
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:23.840]   unconventional path so yeah i mean there's plenty of um there's plenty of literal high school
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:29.920]   dropouts who have gone on to very successful careers in deep learning research exactly yeah
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:36.480]   so that is the that is a challenge if you're in the more yeah more in the biomedical field but
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:44.880]   yeah sometimes you just have to uh work with that system and um i mean yeah i definitely i think um
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:52.240]   and i think i think like also it just depends on yeah if you still think it depends per person
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:59.600]   right like i still feel like i did get a lot out of the commercial system which i i guess maybe for
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:06.640]   some people that may be kind of interesting but like like i still feel like i learned a lot going
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.600]   through the bachelor's program and then even throughout the phd you know getting more
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.640]   experience with research and you know learning how to do good research i mean we'll come back to this
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:23.680]   but your phd supervisor is not at all a conventional person that's true that's true yeah um he also had
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:29.760]   an unconventional background and the lab is definitely unconventional but so like i think
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.200]   there's there's a balance of like you know what opportunities are or what paths are more
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.920]   informational and what paths are unconventional and you know some aspects may be more conventional
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:46.000]   and some may not be and it just depends again on per person and what works best for them but i think
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.440]   i think i still have gotten a lot out of the experience so it's not like anything that i regret
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.640]   you know going down through this prevention and so for you the okay so i just want to come back to
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:04.080]   this so you did the geology and stuff at um community college and did you do some paleontology
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.600]   and astronomy at that community college as well yeah i didn't take it i didn't take an officially
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.520]   like a paleontology class and like there was i think part of the geology there's some paleontology
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.160]   and stuff like that did you end up with any kind of degree or diploma or something from that yeah
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.720]   so from the community college i obtained three associates degrees so those are like two year
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:35.600]   degrees um so in what period of time uh this is in 2015 wait you got three degrees in one year
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   uh well no this still considers like so basically from 2011 to 2014 i was you know that was from
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:52.480]   seven to ten i was you know doing this sort of two classes per semester situation yeah um and then
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:46:00.640]   from 2014 i graduated high school and then from 2014 to 2015 i was taking like four classes per
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:10.080]   first semester and at the end of 2015 i got these uh for three associate degrees three associates
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.640]   degrees okay so what were the what were those areas what the three areas uh general science
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:24.160]   math and physical sciences and foreign language studies okay so then you went into um the bachelor's
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.920]   program yes i went into bachelor's in 2016 so i took another year just to finish up some prerequisites
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.480]   okay things like that and then did you do that bachelor's at uh just to clarify and i know i
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.360]   think a lot of the sort of like the problem was like yeah ideally community college in terms of
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.520]   like when i was taking like two classes per semester that definitely was like kind of you know
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.000]   very slow i think i think that's like it took it took a bit of time so that's why yeah then i was
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.640]   like i really need to get out of high school as soon as possible yeah yeah because you were
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.920]   frustrated right yeah so i think that was another issue like when you say like oh yeah like oh it's
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.720]   kind of slow like i think that was kind of where it comes from is like yeah the two classes kind of
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:11.440]   absolutely and to that rule that was like placed on you yeah required you to go slow and in hindsight
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:18.800]   i guess you're saying you don't see any benefit from that yeah yeah so then you did the bachelor's
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.240]   program so what so so what what was the bachelor's program and where was that was that uc davis yes
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:30.720]   that was uc davis so i technically again um i didn't have when i joined i technically didn't
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.760]   have all the the prereqs for a biomedical engineering program so i technically joined as
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.560]   biotechnology which was like my alternate major on my application but i really wanted to do
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.760]   biomedical engineering like i just really wanted to do that so i managed to like fit in like all
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.640]   the prereqs and get the schedule worked out and i changed my major when i joined into biomedical
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.400]   engineering and like i was taking you know classes over the summer i took like three classes over
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.800]   that summer than i was there and i managed to graduate within uh two years so like you know
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.720]   typically it's like you know when once you transfer it's usually another two years um so i managed to
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.680]   finish up in those two years even with some of the missing prereqs because of the fact that i
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:18.000]   managed to make it up over the summer so yeah that's gonna balance that up and and to be clear
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:26.480]   when you say um you always wanted to do research i mean this is not some um implanted memory you
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.280]   believe now when you're in your ted x talk when you were nine this is exactly what you said you
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:37.440]   said i'm gonna finish a phd before i get my driver's license which you may yet do thanks
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:44.080]   to completely failing to get a driver's license in the normal time yeah yeah i mean i don't really i
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.160]   haven't had the need to right now and get a driver's license so that's why you guys can
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:56.160]   and you certainly have a need to not get it unless you fail to meet your childhood dreams yeah yeah
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:08.800]   okay so you okay so two years of bachelors um and you know i guess the thing about
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.440]   home schooling and stuff is unless you're i mean maybe your parents did it differently
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.440]   but at least in our case we don't really follow a curriculum it's kind of just like oh whatever
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:28.000]   comes along um did you did you find that a lot of stuff in bachelors was like just revision or did
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.080]   you find a lot of it was stuff like you didn't have the necessary prerequisites to know what's
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:40.560]   going on or what was the experience of that yeah um andrew i'm just thinking back here you're now
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:47.600]   like what like 14 years old or how old are you when you're doing it at that time yeah i was uh
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:59.200]   i was 13 years old 13 yeah um i think once i got to my bachelors i think for the most part it was
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:06.240]   mostly new content i think there were certainly some you know ideas and concepts that we have
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:13.120]   you know encountered in the past um and so there's definitely some ideas here and there that like
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.000]   yeah i couldn't already knew uh because yeah it's true that i definitely i think it was also like
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.720]   yeah i think there's also the aspect it's like i've learned whatever i feel like so like um you know
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.360]   there's so like there are some ideas in here and they're like oh i've talked i've learned this
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:35.520]   already but like for the most part i think it was mostly new content so yeah i don't know um
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:42.800]   yeah i think there's also like yeah so a lot of that content maybe is also maybe also it's
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.760]   a little bit harder to actually learn you know just based on online resources and stuff like
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:54.880]   that it's like even some of these classes they don't some of the content don't even like properly
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.480]   follow a textbook or things like that it's more like of course like it's more like the professors
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:05.920]   are teaching stuff and like and at that point you're like also starting to get i think more into like
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:10.640]   part of it is like you're arguing a little bit more into cutting-edge stuff and things like that
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:17.680]   so it's i think it's actually harder to learn like and this is like again more like um
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:24.480]   you know junior and senior year so like these are like upper upper upper year like upper class
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.560]   like yeah these are like you know more specialized classes like again
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:35.360]   most of the on you know the freshman and sophomore stuff you know a lot of that you can easily like
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:40.560]   learn from online material but i think once you get to some of the more specialized material um
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:46.640]   it may be hard i don't know like again i guess maybe someone it just depends i think on the on
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.960]   the field and stuff like that but i think but yeah i think at that point so then again there's
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:56.880]   like again there were certain idea like certain stuff like if you're going to be searching a
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.640]   particular field then you'll know a lot about that and then of course if the class covers it is like
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:05.680]   you know there's no point but like you get the you get the sort of i guess broad perspective of other
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.880]   research fields as well and things like that yeah which interesting which can be really helpful too
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:17.600]   as well so okay let me now switch to the social experience of being a 13 year old at bachelor's
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:25.360]   and i will start by contrasting two cartoon versions of what that social experience might be
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:33.600]   i suspect that the nine-year-old tanish in that ted x talk if asked to describe what it would look
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:42.320]   like if tanish got to go to do a bachelor's would be like oh my god i'm going to be surrounded by
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:48.000]   you know fascinating people interested in my field we're going to spend all of our time talking about
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:57.760]   really interesting scientific concepts where else a you know don't be in a hurry you know
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:05.280]   parent of a friend might be like oh my god it's going to be a social nightmare for them
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.440]   they're going to be the butt of jokes they're not going to understand what's going on around them
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:17.920]   and they'll be in the midst of adult ideas which a young mind is not ready for um yeah
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:24.640]   where on that spectrum was you know did you find yourself what was the experience like for you
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:34.480]   as a kid you know yeah um i think i think for the most part it was again completely
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.800]   um i mean i think socially mostly mostly it was okay i think it was um again interacting
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:49.040]   with again it's not like in i'm i've interacted with people of this age these sort of age groups
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:56.800]   before you know through community college and things like that um i don't i think there there
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:02.720]   there were some you know sometimes there there may be you know a little bit of friction in certain
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:12.800]   aspects of things um so for example like you know sometimes you know students may want to work
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:20.320]   on projects you know for example overnight at someone's house or apartment or whatever
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.160]   door or whatever and i would maybe i would you know i wasn't as comfortable as my parents were
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:33.680]   definitely not comfortable with that and there's also all the like stuff with like um yeah there's
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:42.880]   also that stuff with like um formals and bowls and student clubs and all that i guess like you
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:52.000]   wouldn't really have got to participate in i was involved in like um we have we had like
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:00.640]   a biomedical engineering club so i was involved in that club um and i think there's like maybe one
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.880]   a couple one or two other clubs so i'll go to like some of the socials and stuff like that
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.840]   and of course things like going to bars and stuff like that obviously i can't i'm not going to
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.680]   participate in those and sorts of things you know there are certain again that's true even now
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:21.600]   obviously um so there are certain um social activities that i cannot participate in but
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:28.720]   like i still also have plenty of other social activities that i participate in so um it wasn't
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:35.440]   like certainly yeah i don't think i wasn't like missing out too much on you were feeling like
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:41.840]   yeah you weren't feeling like you were missing out on something important or feeling jealous
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:49.200]   not really i think yeah i mean certainly there are some aspects of like yeah i don't know
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:54.720]   for the most part like i managed to like make it up by like going to a lot of these social activities
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.520]   and you know even interacting during class and stuff like that and did you get some of that
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:09.200]   like intellectually exciting engagement about your field of interest that you were hoping for
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:15.760]   yeah i mean socially like i mean again just from social stuff where i don't it's not like i'm always
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.560]   talking about research and things things like that i mean of course there's definitely that
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:26.400]   engagement i'm getting from going to classes and talking to professors and you know even talking to
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:35.520]   um other undergraduate researchers or even some of the you know phd mentors or whatever so i do get
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.800]   that engagement but then also a lot of the engagement sort of socialization and engagement
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:49.120]   that i have with other uh students and at the same time it was just regular i get socialization i
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:53.920]   guess i don't know there's nothing like it's not i'm not always talking about i guess you know
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.280]   biomedical engineering there's you know i'm talking about other things too so you know
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:05.440]   well you and i always talk about deep learning so what is that that's always true we
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:08.960]   we they're like during the meetings we especially at the beginning you talk about you know
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.760]   what you're up to we talk about what we're up to and things i guess it's always true
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.760]   i'm very happy talking about deep learning this so that's probably my fault
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:25.600]   i mean they like talking about all this research and stuff too but like yeah i mean i just i just
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.640]   try to balance everything i guess yeah everything balanced but it sounds like overall that that
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:37.760]   that experience was closer to what a starry-eyed nine-year-old tanishk was hoping for than then
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:45.920]   what a you know the conservative parent might have been worried about i think so yeah i think so
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:53.840]   i think i think there was more i think there's more like the other thing i think is more like
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:01.120]   things like um in terms of like what was maybe more stressful or more concerning was actually
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:06.640]   more like actual work like things like um just the workload because you know i'm taking like again
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:13.120]   four classes and again most of most of the sort of work is actually not the learning it's more of
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:20.000]   actually doing whole work and you know uh essays and projects and stuff like that and you know
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.480]   that's not a lot of it is not actually learning the concepts it's just like actually doing that
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:32.080]   work and so yeah um it's a lot of work yeah it takes time there's a lot of workloads that that
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:36.320]   can sometimes be a little bit stressful and then and there's certainly again there were some you
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.320]   know like i mentioned some sometimes there will be friction between um you know with certain people
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:47.280]   so you know it's about sometimes managing those social dynamics so there's certainly more i think
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:55.280]   there was definitely some social dynamics that i had to manage when i was in in bafflers um but
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.680]   for the most part you know i think it was a value valuable and interesting and engaging experience
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:10.400]   um as a whole but or are there like you know in terms of both the being of the bachelors and
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:16.880]   the process to getting there in hindsight are there now you know regrets or things you
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.720]   wish you had done differently or do you feel overall like the path you talk is
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:24.800]   you know feels like the right one in hindsight
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:33.840]   think of anything yeah nothing comes immediately to mind in terms of like regrets or anything
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:41.360]   like that i think yeah i think for the most part i think in terms of the bachelors program yeah i
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:51.920]   think it did what what i wanted to do i think okay so maybe like one um one thing was potentially
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:59.760]   so at the time it seemed like a regret but now i don't think it like so like i think a lot of it
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:08.080]   was like um you know being a researcher i even actually during my bachelors i unfortunately
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:14.000]   didn't get to spend as much time working on research as i wanted to um because there was
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.920]   a lot of classwork and especially uh you know yeah especially in these last two years in a typical
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.400]   bachelors program these last two years are especially busy in terms of like for example
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:29.200]   the final year we have like a senior design project which is basically like we have to design
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.760]   a device and build it and supposed to meet kind of needs and all this sort of it's a whole process
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.240]   it's a year-long process and that's like a private and it takes a lot of time so there's a lot of
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:43.840]   things that like took a lot of time and didn't so i didn't get much opportunity to do research
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:52.400]   and so uh you know things like oh um maybe i don't have any many papers when i when i graduate or
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:57.440]   anything like that like sometimes and you know it can be hard to like you know compete for things
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:02.240]   like fellowships and stuff like that when it comes to that and eventually like i was originally
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:08.560]   working in synthetic biology um and in the lab that was interested that i was working in and
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:13.120]   i wanted to continue in that lab but then yeah i think the professor was also maybe a little bit
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:21.120]   concerned about certain things and wasn't willing to have me on um based on your youth or based on
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.320]   no i think more based on the sort of research i'll put around i don't know i think you know
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:30.000]   because you were so busy with all the work you had to do for your bachelors
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.080]   but i was like i think he was like yeah so i think that must have happened like oh i shouldn't
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.480]   have spent so much time on classes and stuff like that like that was like my thing like oh
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:46.080]   why did i spend so much time i should spend more time on research but in hindsight that allowed me
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:53.200]   to pivot more directly towards deep learning so in hindsight like i think it was kind of good that
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:02:00.640]   i actually you know was maybe did it yeah that that didn't work out and allowed me to pivot into
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:06.080]   this new field where i feel like it's you know it's very promising and something that i really
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.280]   enjoyed i mean the other thing was like a few like synthetic biology was like maybe more on
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.800]   maybe could be more exhausting because it's like the sort of that's the sort of research where you
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:22.320]   do have to spend like eight to eight to six or eight to even like something like you know i spend
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:28.240]   like 12 hours in the in the lab every day you know doing stuff and also like it seems from the outside
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:35.440]   like synthbio is exciting but also still pretty speculative as far as i can tell where else deep
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:43.120]   learning is changing the world right now i mean i'm still pretty excited about it but like yeah i can
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.800]   uh but and you know so i'm like that's what i mean by speculative i'm not saying it's not going to
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:55.440]   turn out but like it's like time spent working on ai in medicine is very likely to have a significant
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:01.360]   impact on society where else synthbio feels like i don't know kind of feels like working on quantum
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.320]   computing or something i mean i still think that bio is probably more like further along in quantum
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:13.280]   computing but yeah i see which in the end um but so i think in the end it turned out for the best
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.720]   but i think at the time that was definitely kind of like i had i think i maybe had a little bit of
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:23.280]   that concern i was like oh did i did i do the best thing here and the other thing is like yeah like
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.800]   things like competing for fellowships and stuff because you know you see they're competing with
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:33.600]   that was a non-made made a challenge is you're competing with all these students who have gone
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.160]   through the whole process right they they they've gone from high school maybe they've even done some
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.360]   sometimes they give research opportunities in high school so they have some research opportunities
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.960]   there then they've done the typical bachelor's program so they've done the four years and
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.080]   usually they join a lab by the end of like their first year and so they have three years of doing
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:58.240]   research and so at the end of their bachelor's program they've probably had already at least
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:07.520]   one first authored paper and so when you compare on paper my resume to these other folks a lot of
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.840]   times they will select you know those other folks because they already have all these papers in this
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:18.160]   sort of experience whereas i don't of course that i mean i'm in a whole different situation in terms
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.520]   of my background and i guess my potential as well but that's not what they're looking at so there's
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:29.840]   also that issue as well which for a long time it would you know i didn't have any fellowship it was
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.680]   hard i did have a fellowship an internal fellowship for mr davis but i wasn't able to get any external
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.560]   i couldn't get any external fellowships for for this reason so there was sort of that issue as
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:46.160]   well where i was like oh maybe this was this is a bit of a challenge and it's hard to compare i
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:52.080]   guess for these folks to compare but i mean it must have felt it must have felt like a bit of a
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:56.720]   serious kick in the guts at the time like it must have been a real good point yes it certainly did
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:01.520]   i think you know at that time i was like certainly like thinking about what it was going to do and
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:05.840]   you know i was like yeah in terms of like getting fellowships in terms of finding a lab all these
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.880]   sorts of things this is at the beginning of my phd basically and it was certainly a major major
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:18.640]   challenge uh and having said that it's not like it's not the kind of disappointment that is unknown
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:23.680]   for children to deal with like kids in sport deal with that all the time right they're like
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:29.440]   didn't get into the first team or whatever it's it's it's not necessarily a bad thing
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:34.400]   to have some experience of finding out should be and at the time it was all like a new experience
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:40.240]   either it's not like like it's just overall like i haven't you'd think you'd be surprised
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:45.440]   like i haven't gotten many scholarships or anything like that you people think oh you must
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.880]   have easily gotten like tons of scholarships and stuff like that but surprisingly i i've not been
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:57.280]   able to you know get those sorts of um opportunities luckily for you know undergrad i didn't actually
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:01.200]   get one scholarship that definitely helped and things like that but like you know it's not like
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.600]   i've you know i've heard definitely from a lot of people like oh wow you must have like gotten like
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.440]   tons of scholarships based on your achievements like that's not this actually the scenario i've
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:12.880]   been rejecting him from lots of different scholarships lots of different opportunities
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:18.160]   so it was not even at that time it wasn't something that was new to me um it was so it was
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:22.480]   certainly a saddening experience i think each time you get rejected it still kind of stings a bit
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:27.520]   it's not like oh i don't care about that but you know and eventually i think it all worked out
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.520]   through the best and i think that's what what matters at the end so you know you just kind of
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:37.360]   have to even when you get rejections you have to keep your hopes up that it eventually works out
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:41.840]   because it tends to eventually work out so that was yeah you know i'm lucky that that's what happened
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:51.680]   so before we um talk about like the phd more i'd love to just go back over some things that
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:07:04.080]   i was curious about during during those earlier years um one is um the the uh the time you went
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:09.840]   on the conan o'brien show so for those who don't remember conan was huge you know he was the big
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:19.680]   late night show guy and um and you were his guest um so yeah how did how did that happen
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:30.400]   yeah so um so actually i was on this uh show uh child genius which was this kind of competition
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:35.120]   for many different child prodigies and so i was in order to actually promote that show that's kind
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:44.960]   of what um you know that's why i was invited there um and so yeah that's kind of it just came through
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:50.800]   that and so yeah they were they had a few they were trying to get some of the different testins
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:56.320]   to go on various late night shows and i guess or different various shows i guess like i think yeah
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.560]   there's like conan and like i think one like the late late show and like i think ellen and things
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:05.600]   with dad so they had yeah they had they had some of the kids go on different shows so i got to go on
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:12.160]   conan um yeah and so we have child genius here in australia i wonder if it's the same thing it's
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:18.960]   kind of like a kind of a quiz show where they do like stem things and memory things and
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:26.080]   what pretty much yeah i think all of the same show um it was originally a a british show um
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:33.840]   and that's the original show was from from britain and then they they wanted to do it also in the us
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:40.240]   so uh i think they did two seasons of the show i was in the first season yeah we did two or three
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.800]   here as well and weirdly enough the guy who won the first like we i kind of live in the middle
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:49.440]   of nowhere a bit but funnily enough the guy who won the first series in australia lives like
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.920]   i don't know five or ten minute drive from your house it's really random
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.720]   so do you do do you know that person i kind of don't i always feel like i should reach out
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:07.760]   but i don't know if it's like lame or not yeah it's funny that people now kind of recognize me
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:13.600]   from these appearances and it's sometimes i mean it can be kind of nice to be like oh it's like
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.400]   it's just kind of an additional connection like i mean they're people who are in the ml community
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.840]   and they're like oh i've ever seen you on the show it's cool to see you here now it's like
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.840]   how did you go in the show i think you you probably know like i think it was like a bojan
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:33.760]   um you know on twitter i think um or you know he's like the kaggle grandmaster who's like um
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:39.040]   you know he's that fg boost guy as i like to say um anyway he i remember once he treated me he's
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:44.480]   like oh yeah i remember watching this show um you know a while back and you know we were rooting for
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:49.120]   you and things like that it was like kind of funny to see and i think he also was kind of interested
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:52.960]   and then there was like i think someone yeah i'm one of like one of the collaborators i'm working
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:58.800]   with right now also he was like when i i met him i think at like i think it was at one of the
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.840]   i think it was at icml in the virtual conference or something and he like almost immediately
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.880]   recognized me it was kind of so it's kind of still funny to recognize me um and how did you go in the
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:17.040]   show oh he didn't i was like um so there was like eight rounds i got eliminated after the fifth round
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:23.200]   unfortunately oh not bad by one point or something you got a little bit but uh yeah it was you know
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:29.840]   yeah still sometimes kick myself about that but like you know it's all good at least in the one
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:34.880]   i had here a lot of it seemed to be about memory and it seemed like knowing some basic kind of
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.600]   mnemonic memory palace kind of techniques we've got you a long way did you is that the same for
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.480]   yours um yeah but it was i think i think yeah it was different it was still like the sheer amount
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:50.480]   of stuff that you needed to have memorized it was definitely a little bit difficult especially the
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:56.000]   other issue was like at that time again i was liking i think i was still taking like again like
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.360]   maybe two uh it just happened to me this summer but at the same time i was still taking like two
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.080]   summer classes and you know these are like eight week classes that go by very quickly so i'm like
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:11.920]   trying to keep up with both my summer classes as well you know this quiz show so i think that
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:17.440]   definitely got a little bit tough i mean you know is you know the other contestants definitely did
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:24.320]   not have anything like that to worry about nothing uh there was definitely that very you know i of
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:31.680]   course i felt like you know my my college classes definitely had a higher priority but um i think um
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:36.480]   so i think that was like maybe one of the reasons why it was a little i struggled a bit you know
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:41.440]   just because like you know it's like a week it's basically weekly so like after you do like it's
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.720]   like or like every one or two weeks so it's like one week of one subject then you get the material
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.480]   for the next subject and you've got it like you know this is like okay this is what kind of material
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:54.480]   for the next subject so you gotta study that so it's like every week it's got to study and then
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:59.200]   of course i had my classes and then sometimes they'll come to your house and film you know
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:03.200]   because they want to have all right yeah they do all the background is whatever it was it was a very
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:09.920]   chaotic um so yeah in spite of all that you know i guess you know i managed to send my well i mean
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:14.880]   there were still i mean still some of the memory stuff i i'm still kind of like amazed that i could
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:20.560]   do some of that stuff still did you learn like explicitly at some point some of those kind of
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:27.200]   memory palace techniques or kind of uh not you know number lists techniques yeah yeah exactly
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.480]   so like i mean i actually did they teach you that or that was something you would already
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:37.920]   know yeah i never actually learned anything like that in the past um and then it was
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:43.360]   it was yeah so i never actually did any memory palace stuff in the past um i think maybe something
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.080]   that probably should explore even more even further now a lot of it i do tend to just do
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:54.080]   road memorization and it seems to work very seems to work fine for me overall like i've memorized
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.600]   speeches that you know like 20 20 minute speeches and i can memorize them in like two hours just
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:05.040]   road memorization and i just managed to do that like um you know so i've never had an issue with
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:09.760]   that kind of thing but there were some parts where like so there was like one part was like a deck of
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:14.720]   cards and memorizing a deck of cards that one was a little bit harder to do road memorization yeah
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:22.240]   absolutely yeah so so i mean the day before the day before the actual competition or the actual
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:30.000]   quiz um we decided to train change strategy and i studied how the memory palace method worked and
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.920]   this is like yeah one or two yeah i mean there's no way you can do that without hemonic techniques
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:41.120]   so yeah this is like one or two days before the actual quiz and you know of course that's not
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:45.680]   including the time going to fly and all the hotel and all that so this is one or two days before
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:51.440]   like yeah about a day before and i i just studied the uh memory palace technique we came up with
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.560]   this sort of memory palace and and i was trying to play around with it and i was like starting to get
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:01.760]   like you know 49 50 of the cards now correct and i was like starting you know i said now i was like
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.880]   okay i feel pretty confident about this before you know i was not i was only getting like maybe half
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:09.040]   of the cards and like i'm really struggling and with the memory palace it really seemed to work
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.600]   i said it turns out for the actual competition i did the actual quiz and did the actual memorization
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.280]   i think we were giving like an hour to memorize it or something like that i think it was about an
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:23.200]   hour yeah i think it was an hour and i managed to get all 52 correct nice well some people might not
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:30.160]   be familiar with this so can you explain how what a memory palace technique is or maybe specifically
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.360]   what technique you use to memorize the whole deck of cards because a lot of people would be if they
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:40.320]   aren't unfamiliar the technique will be like oh okay this guy's a total teen mess but actually
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:46.960]   anybody can do this right yeah yeah yeah so the way i had it set up was like so you have like you
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.000]   know if it's like a you know ace of space you know like an ace of yeah ace of spades or something
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:58.240]   like that you know basically like that you have you assign it you know like ace you assign to some
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:04.560]   sort of um you assign different characteristics like ace could be like for example maybe a person
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:07.840]   some somebody you know or something like this i think that's how i had it set like the ace was a
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:13.200]   person and spades would be like maybe something um related to spades so i don't know like you know
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.200]   some novel or something like this you know something related so so the end of person like is also
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.520]   probably related so like if it's an eighth maybe you'd be something maybe a person whose name starts
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.160]   with an a or something like that yeah and then what you do is that you know you have like in this case
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:33.360]   cards in a deck so uh the way i had it set up was like you know you have 52 locations in say your
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.200]   house and then you know they're in some sort of order and then you kind of um you kind of imagine
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:47.040]   that at each um location you you put this sort of card so by putting the card you're thinking of
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.760]   whatever object or person or whatever you have with whatever action you know based on you know
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.320]   ace of spades it's like some person with the spade or something like something some sort of action
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:01.280]   in the person and then you put them at that sort of location in right or your palace your memory
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:07.360]   palace in your imagination exactly in your imagination palace which i had is just my house
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:12.320]   and then you have these different locations and then when you're remembering it you can kind of
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:18.480]   just walk along that path and you know you kind of just visually are walking along that path and
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.200]   like okay you're at you know for example you're at the garage okay now in the garage we're supposed
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.120]   to be there you know you've already placed that person he comes much easier because you you know
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.520]   you have like a person you have an action it's more like tangible it's much easier to memorize
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:37.920]   and say ace of spades like exactly and there's also segways from one to the next like exactly
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:42.640]   maybe kind of like maybe sometimes some people try to like maybe come up come up with like a story
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:50.560]   or something like that to just kind of you know further you know cement that sort of uh you know
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:57.360]   that pattern did you ever read the book moon walking with einstein i have not that's that's
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:01.760]   great yeah it's um so i don't know if you've heard of ed cook ed cook was like the
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:09.600]   greatest memory world memory champion of all time like one i can't remember five or six world
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:15.360]   championships or something and basically he he worked with a guy called joshua four who was a
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:23.760]   journalist slash author who considered himself a very bad memory and bought josh for these memory
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:32.400]   techniques over a one-year period and then josh for entered the u.s national memory championships
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:41.440]   to see how he went you know and um it's a quite a delightful book actually and i've actually met
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:47.680]   josh she's a really super guy he he went on to found uh batless obscura you know that fantastic
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:53.440]   i think yeah i think that's like all kinds of interesting kind of bankoids about it looking
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:18:03.520]   so yeah yeah and uh yeah his his point was basically yeah and anybody can yeah do this
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:10.640]   to an extremely high level if you just learn how um and i've spent a significant chunk of time
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:17.200]   learning that as well the more you know there's like it's also useful for learning about your
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.640]   own psychology because you learn about how brains remember things that are like
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:28.240]   funny ridiculous violent related to celebrities related to family members whatever so you kind of
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:32.960]   come up with a story with the properties of things that our brains are good at remembering
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:39.280]   yeah yeah some of my house is written down the exact thing i have to find that like there's a
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:44.000]   i have a paper of like the exact uh yeah what i've assigned you know for the different cards
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.280]   and then the other thing is like i was kind of surprised like even with memory palace
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:53.600]   how long you can remember it i think like maybe yes there were so i was still able to remember it
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.680]   which just like had a surprising like you know and if you then follow a spaced memory technique
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:03.440]   for yeah if you then follow a spaced memory technique for revising it you will literally
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.720]   know yeah then you'll remember our feed yeah but i mean i i didn't really care if i could
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.600]   put that forever i i guess there's something important you you definitely could do that and
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:19.120]   you know yeah um so i don't know that's kind of interesting um so actually talking of which
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:27.040]   do you used you know spaced repetition at all or have you um i mean i think i dabbled in it for a
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:36.640]   bit um but you know i think it's just like something like this so like for me yeah i think
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:41.280]   this i i definitely still want to investigate it i guess it's like i think there's a lot of this
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.880]   like sort of system and also like um and it's definitely something that it's like something
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:51.360]   i definitely need to get started with and i still haven't you know dying i think i you know i've
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.280]   definitely dabbled with it like i think i maybe made a few cards like an anky or something like
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:01.520]   i think there was like an anky droid app or something like this yeah there is an anky droid app
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:06.320]   and i was like playing around with it um so let me just quickly explain to people who might not be
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:11.200]   familiar this is just like a really simple idea that came out of the 19th century research
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:20.720]   by a guy called uh having house it basically says if you try to remember something um that you
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.360]   previously learned after one day and then after three days and then after a week and then after
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:29.120]   three weeks and then after a couple of months you know this kind of exponential increasingly
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:36.880]   time scale yeah you'll remember it forever with you know super linearly decreasing amounts of
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:49.680]   effort um so yeah i i actually would love to uh uh encourage you to try it because um my
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:55.200]   my daughter does it you know and it's so cool teaching her and her friend math and knowing
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.880]   they do their anky cards each day so i know everything i've ever taught them they definitely
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:07.520]   remember all of it because if they didn't you know then their anky would be revising it at the
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:14.480]   right time and my wife's yeah thank you stuff is like at a certain point like doesn't your deck
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:21.360]   become unnaturally large and like very difficult to to deal with no not if you manage it carefully
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:28.800]   because you have exponentially increasing just time distances between h1 it's yeah that doesn't
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:33.760]   happen so i learned chinese i learned chinese and i have a bad memory i would say i don't know
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:37.840]   everybody's memory is pretty similar statistically speaking but yeah i think mine maybe is slightly
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:44.160]   worse than usual but i learned 6 000 chinese characters faster than anybody at the chinese
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:50.080]   university had ever heard of basically by doing anky and not just anky but also using a
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:56.800]   fairly sophisticated um mnemonic methodology that had been developed at the university of huai
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:05.440]   and um yeah i still remember those characters and one of the things i really like about it tanishic
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:15.600]   is that it forces you to like get serious about recognizing your both capabilities and limitations
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:20.160]   which is to say if your anky deck is too much then you are trying to learn more things than you can
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:27.360]   remember you know um so then you have to make a choice like okay you're doing things optimally
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:33.440]   it's too big so you now have to decide what things do you want to learn because you can't
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:41.840]   you know so then you kind of don't end up studying so much that you can't remember it so right i i
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:47.600]   like that about it you know and um yeah my wife's studying for masters at the moment she's already
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:52.640]   got a phd so she's keeping busy and she's using anky for the first time and she's just like oh my
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:57.600]   god i don't have to study for exams anymore you know she gets 100 percent because she knows she
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:04.800]   knows it all i knew like like uh medical commonly that reason i don't know how successful it is i
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:09.520]   assume it's pretty successful if everyone's doing it but yeah i don't know why it's so popular in
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.640]   medicine but almost nothing else but i feel like for claire you know when she does that for the next
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:19.760]   12 years everything she's there's not everything that she's learned to remember everything that
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:23.760]   she's learned that she wants to remember to remember so i always say to her don't add a
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:30.880]   card until like unless you want to remember it forever or your teacher tells you this is
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:39.360]   something you do need to know um so anyway sorry for the slight diversion is there a way of benefit
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:46.400]   like i don't like for example medical school students they like tend to uh like download
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.840]   anky decks online and things like that and i guess mine like things like yeah that's a bad idea
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:55.520]   yeah like what is it like because then i've talked to other people and they're like well
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:01.520]   you know it's maybe you know like you're still memorizing it and still remaining in memory so
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:06.640]   like i guess that's another thing i was like writing it down yourself versus using other
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:11.680]   people and you guess it's also yeah yeah no no do it yourself so actually there's a guy called
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:17.840]   peter wasniak who rediscovered the work of ebbing house independently and has dedicated his life to
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:24.800]   you know practicing it and studying it and he's got a great website called super memo dot guru
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:32.960]   and he's got 20 tips for like actually learning stuff and one of the key tips is like yeah like
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.160]   create your own cards and like they need context you know so like for my chinese i listened to a
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:42.800]   lot of podcasts in chinese and every character i learned that you know i would have the sentence
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:49.120]   where i first learned about it as part of the card for claire's cards you know there's always
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:55.920]   a drawing or a snapshot from a youtube video or something of like this is where you like this
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.320]   and that you've got the context you've got the reason to remember it you've got the
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:05.520]   that sense of like oh this is what i was doing at the time you know all the stuff that helps your
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:15.920]   brain yeah if you download anchor cards you miss all that it's yeah okay you know yeah yeah i think
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:20.320]   it's definitely this you know the sort of things like well like i think also like i don't like um
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:27.760]   i think like radic made a whole anchor card sort of situation for you know fast ci course
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:33.600]   she he had like a quiz website and all and ai quizzes.com or something yeah yeah that was doing
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:38.400]   it and i think um i was getting emails and then i think it was doing it i don't know did i think
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.560]   like the emails stopped or something so i don't know if i messed up something or if it just like
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:46.960]   stop taking emails so i think there's a good reminder for me to go back and check that as
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.440]   well because that obviously the ai stuff is stuff that i definitely want to you know make sure the
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:58.160]   other thing i'll say though is if you're using the things you learn you remember it like i never use
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:04.320]   anki or anything for like any programming topic or whatever i just i just code
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:12.400]   because i hear like a lot of times um sometimes yeah programmers use it for example to memorize
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.800]   apis and things like that so as you're saying you you mentioned that because seems like that's
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.120]   another app a common application i think like people like sometimes there are programmers who do that
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.960]   so yeah i'm curious why i guess you just never i guess as you're using it like do you ever feel
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.800]   that they can maybe yeah there may be certain apis or certain like commands and stuff that you may
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:38.880]   feel like yeah i've just never found that i i yeah because i'm using it anyway so after that uh
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.280]   sorry i hadn't quite realized uh you wrote child genius and it's a sign of show and that's super
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.480]   interesting to me but i want to yeah so coming back to okay so you're on conan um now i don't
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:56.880]   know if i'm being ridiculous or over sensitive or whatever but my reaction to seeing you on conan
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:03.760]   was i felt um pretty mad actually i felt annoyed at him because
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:10.000]   it's not that he said anything rude to you but i definitely felt like he was
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:15.200]   like i don't know what i don't know what you're saying in american history i'd say
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:22.800]   taking the piss you know he was like basically imply you know laughing at the fact that you're
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:32.240]   interested in physics or laughing at the fact that you want to get a phd um yeah i mean what i mean
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:36.800]   did you did you feel that or did you feel it's all good or how i'm looking back do you feel
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:43.120]   differently to how exactly i think you may be like the first person who's ever said anything
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.720]   like that before so honestly i'm kind of surprised that you you you think that way i don't know it's
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:56.080]   like every like i've had i mean if you didn't feel that way then that's good experience on the show
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:00.880]   right i mean he was you know you know i mean he seemed like it's really nice to you backstage
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:05.920]   and whatnot right well i didn't the other thing was like you know when you was it was a comedy
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:10.720]   show and you know part of it is we are kind of we're kind of in on the joke too right like i think um
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:16.720]   like you know i i i definitely realized that you know me i guess yeah well some of the examples
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.760]   were like you know me wishing for enzymes for christmas or you know a calculator or textbooks
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.560]   and things like that and you know it's like even i understand even at that age i realized that that
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:32.480]   is you know abnormal and like it's not like delivers things like like we it was also things
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:35.920]   like we brought up like you know this was like yeah this is something we could talk about it's
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.600]   kind of funny it's like and like you know you know i realized that like you know this is this
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:47.440]   is different i didn't i think it's more like you know it's not it was not laughing at me as you know
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:51.360]   it was more like oh it's different it's kind of interesting kind of thing you know it's not that's
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:55.200]   kind of what it was like oh it's kind of funny that it's interesting like you know this kid
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.920]   like wants enzyme like even like you know i know like i really want it but i realized you know
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:05.040]   people find that kind of odd and you know i i didn't have any i didn't take an issue with it
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:09.680]   that's great i mean now i feel kind of lame for taking issue with it because i definitely felt
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:15.280]   like it um i mean you know conan himself was like he's a very smart guy to he went to harbor and
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:20.640]   he's not like so he you know i i don't think i think you know it's just a joke for all of us
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:25.120]   i think it was not it was not you know they're not it's course that's great you know that they
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:29.200]   don't have any illville against me or anything like that so oh no i mean of course not i just
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:36.000]   yeah i was just joking about the fact that you're an intelligent person who has bold dreams i don't
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:47.440]   know like if some kid went on who had just won the under 1700 meters track and field when they
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:53.920]   were 11 i don't feel like that would they would be laughing about you know if they said like what do
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:59.200]   you want to be when you grow up and it'd be like a professional athlete like you know i don't know it
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:04.000]   just feels i don't know if they were necessarily laughing about that it either was more laughing
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.560]   about like yeah you know kind of funny then you know i want in terms of or like and then of course
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:16.640]   i was telling jokes too and that was kind of absolutely love your jokes that so um i don't
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:22.320]   know i i felt like like i thought the chemistry between me and kon and the other guest work was
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:26.320]   you know really good and i kind of felt like i was also in my element at the time so i don't know i
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:31.600]   felt like personally i thought it was that it was a you know a fairly good interview uh all together
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:37.520]   i mean i mean obviously it must have been given that nobody else has complained about this kid
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:42.320]   before and you didn't feel the same way so absolutely it's uh yeah that's why i prefaced
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:48.800]   this by saying i i might be totally i don't know i think you know i think it was like you know
[02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:53.360]   kon is i think known for his kind of self-deprecating humor and i think it was just kind of you know kind
[02:30:53.360 --> 02:31:00.240]   of along that sort of line of you know yeah oh i mean i love konan to be clear i i watched him
[02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:06.800]   nightly for years yeah i have no problem with the guy i think it's great and it was good that also
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:11.760]   like you know he we met him before before the interview and you know stuff like that's just
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:16.400]   to you know make me feel more comfortable yeah yeah i think even like if i did get to meet him
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:21.680]   and stuff you know maybe i could see myself maybe feeling a little bit maybe weird to help by there
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:25.680]   something like that i don't know and then i mean they really like me have it on the show and like
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:30.960]   i think later on they wanted me to do like one of their web exclusives or something like this with
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:35.600]   like like fester brian cox or something like this so that they have me up for another thing like
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:40.640]   that oh i never saw that that's interesting yeah it's like on it's on like the teen cocoa website
[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:46.080]   so i don't think many people have seen it actually but like i did one so i came back later um
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:52.880]   uh yeah so i actually came back for another episode where brian cox was a guest and um after
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:57.200]   his interviews i got to watch the interview and you know kind of be part of their you know part
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:05.920]   of the backstage you know and then after afterwards when brian cox was done um uh then they yeah i got
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:10.880]   to interview him and you know just also had another bit good time that's awesome we love brian cox
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:19.360]   um yeah so that was another um event and like yeah so yeah i really yeah it was i really had a lot
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:23.120]   of fun actually but you know both of those current sessions i was like yeah that's like
[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:28.400]   what one of the coolest things i feel like i've i've done so amazing yeah of course you know i've
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:32.880]   done a lot of cool things um you know i've had to you know i'm very grateful and lucky but i think
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:37.920]   this is also one of the cool things that i got to do well let's yeah i mean so tell me more what
[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:44.480]   what are other like memorable moments in your life or like just things that you look back on and feel
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:57.440]   a lot of joy or pride or whatever yeah um or and certainly like even now is like i think now i kind
[02:32:57.440 --> 02:33:01.360]   of feel like maybe i'm in that stage where like wow this is like you know part of this sort of
[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:08.560]   ai revolution and being kind of you know at the forefront of that you know at this company that
[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:14.960]   is all obviously you know taking leading charge on that and you know working with lots of um
[02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:24.560]   respectable names in the field um and um yeah like like something like yeah what we're doing
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:31.200]   yeah i just feel like what we're doing right now um is yeah it's going to change the world right
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:38.480]   like or it is the same way yeah and so i i'm i'm i'm very proud of that and i want that to continue
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:44.240]   as much as possible um and so i'm just kind of like trying to enjoy the ride as well um so that
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:50.080]   certainly like that comes to mind like you know i for example the stability ai launch party i was
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.440]   i was in attendance for that and it's like you could see like you know these are like the biggest
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:00.240]   names in the field like in the in the tech industry overall not just in ai like you know i don't know
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:06.320]   if you heard like sir gay brin was there and i do like it's like you know the biggest need in the
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:13.920]   field and they're all there to to witness this and it's like i'm lucky to be part of that team
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.720]   um you know i that's kind of you know i i this may be going in the history books we never know
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.040]   i mean absolutely and not just part of the team but later in that team yeah that's why i'm really
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:34.720]   excited to to be um in that space and i think i'm i think those memories are being made right now
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:41.200]   yeah um let's see what else i mean it was cool that like you know you you invited to one of our
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:51.040]   regular chats the guy who basically built the technology that yeah that stable
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:58.560]   perfusion that the stability ai is based on and we got to hear from him directly how it came to pass
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:09.600]   and yeah it's like he yeah because he yeah i i know him now it through stability and it's kind of
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:16.160]   interesting to to interact with you know someone who's clearly the leader in the field and um
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:21.440]   and learn from them like that's the biggest thing is like i was trying to and this is what you really
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:26.640]   always wanted right like that you were talking about as a kid is wanting to do research with
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:37.040]   top researchers exactly yeah this is definitely i definitely the dream um and yeah so that's an
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:45.600]   awesome answer um what about yeah going back a bit other yeah memorable moments like i was going
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.800]   to say like the tanex talk was definitely a memorable woman i think yeah there's a lot of
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:55.360]   preparation that went to that actually you know it was like actually a few months of preparation
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:36:01.680]   so yeah it was actually quite uh i mean your delivery was excellent you know yeah definitely
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:09.280]   i practiced it several times you know they they gave some some help as well and um i think it
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:18.800]   they came out well um it did yeah uh let's see what else um i think it was like i think a lot of the
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.000]   you know somewhat some of the international trips were also very exciting too so like yeah i was
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:31.920]   reading about a trip you took to india to vjti where your mom was saying that one of your
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:37.200]   ancestors had been like director of his institute or something is that is that one of those memorable
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:45.760]   trips for you yeah the dean of the college or something like that yeah um so yeah i was
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:51.600]   invited to to speak at one of their um i think it was like some tech uh event you know like so it's
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:59.040]   like so what is vjti oh yeah vjti is like one of the again leading uh universities the tech
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:07.680]   universities um in india so you know india does have a lot of good uh it because focused
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:12.960]   universities in general so vjti is one of those universities um and so they have like the sort of
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:18.640]   i think it's like technobanza or some of these it's a fairly big event multi-day event um and
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:27.840]   you know they have uh you know they have lots of different things going on competitions talks all
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:32.480]   kinds of different you know tech related stuff um so they invited me to give like i think it was
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:35.920]   like kind of like one of their keynote talks or like one of their they have a non-talk series
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:42.720]   and you know there's a lot of esteemed um guests that have given talks uh in the past through this
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.600]   talk series and i mean it must have been pretty special for your mom too since her her uncle was
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:54.640]   the director of the place to be to be back yeah well so yeah he wasn't he's not anymore but he
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:38:00.240]   was in the past and i think my mom you know had had caught him to the university in the past
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:06.640]   and uh you know uh you know had made you know some visits in the past when when my yeah been
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.640]   when when he was there and so actually afterwards um after the talk we actually you know they have
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:18.560]   the the the living quarters for the for the dean over there and we actually made a visit and my
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:23.520]   mom was actually a little bit nostalgic about like yeah because she she actually come there
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:28.960]   before she yeah she went there before and it was hanging around she she had you know she had made
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.200]   a few visits so she she was actually a little bit nostalgic about that you know definitely yeah
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:38.560]   definitely proud of that you know um then you know uh you know several years later hit up you know
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:46.160]   i guess a couple decades later um you know um i i'm i'm there to to to speak but for me i think what
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.360]   was really great about that trip was so you know there's a lot of students and also there was a lot
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:56.080]   of like high school students as well so like a lot of high school students came and um and it's like
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.800]   i think they had some competitions and stuff like that and then they had me like give the awards to
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:07.600]   all the students actually wow and they also and even afterwards that a lot of the students came
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:11.280]   up to me and they were you know they wanted to take pictures of me and they were wanting to
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:19.440]   to get my heart over the abs and it was like it was like kind of like i think like that's like
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:25.040]   i'm very glad to know that i've inspired a lot of you know students around the world i think that
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:30.960]   definitely the huge impact not so like like that's another thing like about like i think we'd be
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.120]   talking about this earlier in terms of like what i'm doing as a researcher but in an also blind
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.680]   journey as a child prodigy and like balancing that out in terms of like who i am as you know
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:46.800]   is my identity right i think i think um you know inspiring all these students you know through my
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.240]   journey is something that i'm definitely very proud of um and so i definitely yeah i take a
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.560]   lot of pride in that and so that's why like i don't also want to i don't want to minimize that
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:05.520]   obviously yeah but so the balance you're talking about there is like at one level you know you were
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:13.360]   lorded recognized as a child genius child prodigy and that is something which can provide
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:18.800]   a role model direction inspiration for other kids but at another level
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:27.600]   you know now you're you're not a kid you're an adult and you i guess would want to be recognized
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:36.000]   for your current achievements rather than your that you know your interesting past is that is
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.560]   that the compromise you're referring to yeah exactly yeah um yeah yeah that's kind of what i'm
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:47.920]   talking about um yeah and so i said you know these sorts of events where like you know i get to talk
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:54.000]   to some of these people all these students um you know kind of face to face reminds me of you know
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.280]   that you know my my journey has added a huge impact on others uh you know there's so many
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:04.480]   moments like that like yeah i think a couple i think it was like last year or so or maybe
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:09.520]   yeah a couple years ago there was some news about you know uh there's a student who also
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:19.920]   was trying to accelerate in her academic um in india and the the the judge actually cited
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:26.960]   i think my tedx talk um you know and and use that as you know ed kind of a as evidence or like kind
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:33.600]   of as um you know typically just for in support of the student so you know even kind of i get
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:38.640]   that the you know even in the courts that they are using my case to help to help other students and
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:46.160]   that's obviously something that's well as are we i mean um in my family you know i've watched your
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:52.000]   tedx talk with my daughter it's like perfect timing for her because she's at the age that
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.520]   you're referring to in the talk even though you were two years older and we've also watched
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:01.920]   child genius australia together which is generally around about kids at more
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:09.280]   eight or nine but you know in the general ballpark and yeah i think she you know she liked
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:18.880]   seeing people that doing things that seemed exciting and um not totally out of reach and being
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:27.200]   as respected and appreciated for that absolutely i think it does um i think it's made a difference
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:33.040]   for our family yeah that's that's really good to hear yeah yeah so yeah it definitely means a lot
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:38.480]   to me when i when i hear that from from people so even you know even so it was good to to see that
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:44.560]   both in person um you know i was there at the gti and then also in the same trip we also went to
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:52.160]   like a high school um and you know i think yeah the they invited me in to to give a talk and also
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:58.160]   my sister did to sing there and and then a lot of people yeah um you know we're very happy and they
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:03.760]   they asked they asked us a bunch of questions they were very engaged and and um yeah it was it was
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:13.440]   good to to to see that you know it certainly um i guess lighted up their day and and um and inspired
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:18.400]   them and and then i still get messages occasionally on on you know on twitter facebook whatever and
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:26.400]   you know that's also you know always great to see and also i mean i i imagine your trip to nasa must
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:34.000]   have some special memories yeah is that chronologically yeah i'm not quite sure how that
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:40.800]   where that is my trip to nasa i must have been like nine years old or so so yeah it says here
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.120]   you're in nine july 2012 yeah so like that was also like a very interesting trip because
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.800]   i was like starting trip maybe download a little bit of research so that's kind of gonna like
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:58.560]   started first dabbling in a bit of research and so that was like me talking about um i think it was
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:03.200]   like something but like citizen size tools and how it could be used or something something like it
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:08.880]   was like oh nice uh moving topography and stuff like that and there's like a different in the
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.880]   different citizen science tools and i was like comparing them and talking about that so so yeah
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:16.400]   i was doing something like that because yeah at that time of course citizen science tools were
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.720]   kind of like one of the few ways i could you know get involved so i was like really excited to play
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:26.560]   around with such tools and you know how did you get that how did you get that opportunity because
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:33.280]   at least according to what i'm reading it says you're the youngest person to speak at a nasa
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:40.160]   conference i mean i've been to a few you know nasa events in the past that i think we were able to
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:46.480]   reach out to some of the the folks there and they were very willing to to support me and support my
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:50.960]   interest so luckily through that you know through some of the folks there so this is uh by the way
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:58.080]   this is a at nasa aim so this isn't oh cool yeah i taught there for a while yeah oh yeah um was that
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:04.240]   through like singularity yeah yeah through rescue yeah it's a it's a fascinating campus with that
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:12.400]   giant uh airship um thing in the middle yeah i remember like the back then so like i know there
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:18.320]   was like like i think they were like you know dismantling it i think there's like asbestos
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:25.680]   problems or something yeah that's exactly right they they dismantled it and actually um they let
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:31.840]   if i remember correctly sergei and larry used the airstrip there kind of in exchange for them
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:40.480]   helping to fund that oh yeah you know so yeah i was lucky to be there before it was torn down
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:46.080]   well as i was going like you know i think maybe you know some of the first events were like maybe
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:51.520]   in 2010 2011 and then i started going for you know it for a few years like i was like watching
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:56.400]   you know seeing it getting dismantled over you know months and months and you just see it like
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:01.120]   slowly getting dismantled so it was kind of interesting to kind of see that um but yeah
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:06.800]   so i made a few contacts at nasa aims that way um yeah and you know cool i know the i guess the
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:11.680]   lure science institute or whatever that they had there and they were kind of saying for me it was
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:18.080]   quite an inspiring place to be around like there's always interesting things happening and um
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:24.640]   yeah like you know they have this they had this amazing visualization kind of wall they had uh
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.080]   quantum computing happening there and of course the place is kind of dotted with
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:36.160]   relics of the space here around the place yeah would have i mean as a like i mean for me as an
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.160]   adult it was bloody exciting but i guess for a nine-year-old it must have been even more amazing
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:46.240]   it was definitely very exciting um and yeah i think that was probably maybe that may have been
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:52.080]   like my first conference now that i think about it i think that may have been like my first
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:56.160]   scientific conference that i attended uh maybe it was still like mostly like you know high school
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.760]   student stuff but they like presenting research and stuff so it was still kind of like a you know
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:05.040]   it was like a symposium so yeah like a you know research related and so i was you know i think
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:11.920]   that was like a really great event for me to kind of like soak that all in uh and and also at that
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:20.640]   at that age my understanding talking of astronomy you you started a or co-founded a astronomy club
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:27.520]   yeah yeah college yeah so i think i guess like yeah i was taking a astronomy class there
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:33.440]   and then you know there's a lot of big club opportunities you know at community colleges
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:40.240]   and so um yeah i think maybe we talked about like you know clubs and stuff like that um so like even
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:45.360]   even in community colleges there are a lot of great clubs in terms of like yeah geology biology
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:50.240]   all these different clubs yeah um and so even then i was like wanting to get involved in those sorts
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:54.800]   of opportunities but it turned out for like the astronomy department they didn't actually have any
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:48:01.280]   sort of student-run club or anything like that um so you know i just you know brought that up to my
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:09.040]   professor and said like this is something maybe we could could have over here um and um yeah he was
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:14.400]   he was also on board and you know interested in you know helping out because you have to have like
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:19.440]   one faculty member kind of sign off with on your on your application or whatever and then we kind
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:24.400]   of were starting to recruit folks and so we had some folks who were interested and we formed a
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:30.480]   small little club um and then um it kind of grew into also a physics club i think they didn't also
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:37.360]   have a physics club at the time so we need like a physics and astronomy club um but so i was like
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:42.640]   the founding vice president so i was the vice president for like two maybe two years i think
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:48.880]   two or three years something like that and uh we kind of started a couple projects um i wasn't
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:53.520]   unfortunately able to see those projects through but they would manage to finish some of those
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:58.000]   projects like there were some projects you know sending up you know these high-altitude balloons
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:03.120]   and doing different experiments and um you know that was all fun i don't know if they like yeah i
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.440]   know that they went went ahead and finally did some high-altitude balloon experiments
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:14.000]   and the time i was very interested in astrobiology and you know the you know kind of this sort of
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.800]   uh space biology and things like that so i was coming up with like experiments around that focus
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:24.800]   um i don't know if they actually pursued that but yeah that was another opportunity where i started
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:32.000]   getting a little bit more involved in reading papers that kind of thing um so that was a really
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.920]   useful opportunity for me and i was yeah really happy to be able to do that and you know so it
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:44.560]   sounds like a lot of your it sounds like a lot of your highlights are absolutely related quite
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:51.840]   strongly to your to your studies and your research at least in that period of your life yeah i guess
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:58.320]   so um so it's not surprising because it's been yeah i mean not many adults would have had those
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:05.040]   opportunities that maybe a little bit different one um yeah i'm afraid i think there's anything
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:09.520]   that's fine i'm not trying to push you in a different direction i actually wanted to
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:17.360]   switch that on its head a little bit if that's okay because like yeah i mean i'm just thrilled
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:22.960]   to hear that you've had so many amazing opportunities and experiences and they've
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:29.280]   brought you joy and excitement but uh you know i was wondering if you don't mind also sharing
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:39.040]   like what have been some of the toughest moments in your recently short career and life so far
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:45.200]   and how have you dealt with those yeah i mean i kind of maybe i've touched on it on a few already
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:56.560]   in terms of just like a lot of it is dealing with naysayers and folks are what was that time being
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:02.640]   bullied in grade three would that be like up there or is that kind of gotten far enough in
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:09.760]   the past now or during the time in community college also um so i was in basically up until
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:17.120]   i graduated high school i didn't even know even after that you know um you know for graduate high
[02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:22.320]   school um like i was taking community college classes and say for example chemistry and the
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:27.360]   professor was like oh i'm not sure if you're you know going to be able to carry through the labs
[02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:35.440]   and things like that um um what did they mean by that well i guess it's just more like being able
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:40.800]   to deal with i guess hazardous substances and stuff like that they were already that's not
[02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:45.920]   going to be possible with the you know i was at that time 10 years old so and tanish just to
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:58.960]   clarify did does this feel like a tough memory because that kind of prejudice made you feel
[02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:04.320]   angry or sad or is it just the way in which it was stopping you from doing the things you wanted
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:09.520]   to do or a bit of both i think it was a bit of both i think it was like a lot of it was definitely
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:14.880]   i think you know it was very frustrating that's what it was it was um you know frustrating and
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:22.160]   um you know it's just like yeah there's a lot that you have to deal with like it just felt
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:26.720]   like you know i'm there to i'm there to learn and then it's like you have to do with all this how
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:32.160]   they're sort of like baggage in a way well exactly that's how i was like i was actually talking to my
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:37.600]   wife rachel today before i chatted to you and it's like i was kind of telling her what i wanted to
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:44.000]   talk about and i kind of said the way i see that period of life it felt like you were saying
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:49.600]   i want to be allowed to learn and that there was some group of people who were
[02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:57.760]   saying you should not have that right and that just seems so wrong to me right right i feel angry on
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:05.760]   your back yeah yeah you and yeah i mean that you can you can imagine how my parents felt right
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:12.240]   they were especially uh uh angry and frustrated with the you know the administration with the
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:18.560]   professors all kinds of yeah so it was it was so yeah i think that's a lot of where my frustration
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:26.880]   came and then then of course i certainly um you know as as i um i mean even in like university i
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:32.640]   think certainly um you do have i definitely had you know frustration dealing with you know certain
[02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:38.960]   students and things like that and like i said you know what kind of things happened oh just like
[02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:47.840]   again um you know certain like you mean more like teasing or it's more like again like i said
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:54.880]   working you know like they expect you to you know work overnight with them on things like like so
[02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:59.360]   like there was a lot of like for example tension with maybe like we had a senior design project
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:04.400]   and you know there's there's a lot of work that goes into that and even though like so like i was
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:11.200]   effectively kind of leading you know leading the team like i had in fact um conceptualized the
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:16.000]   idea that we would work on and you know we decided that's what i'm going to work on and you know
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:20.720]   all of that but even then there's still like a lot of tension between within the within the group
[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:25.680]   because you know there's certain things i couldn't do like you know work at someone's uh you know
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:32.240]   stay at someone's apartment overnight to to work on you know the airport or you know yeah whatever
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:38.320]   and so i mean honestly that feels pretty callous to me i mean they know that you're a kid like it
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:45.360]   seems like i'm slightly shocked that people were um was it like maybe they just felt like you
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:52.560]   shouldn't be there at all and that this is their way of i think i think it was like i think it was
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:57.920]   like certainly like this i think the expectation was you should be like a normal polish did it
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:05.200]   right like that's kind of the expectation so i think they may be more willing to work you know
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.680]   there's some issues working outside of the box you know outside of those regular expectations um
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:17.360]   so you know there was a you know there's a lot of tension definitely within the group but uh
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:23.920]   you know eventually i mean managed to to resolve that you know in a in a i guess in an amicable
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:29.360]   manner finally at the end but it was definitely how did you do that i think i mean at a certain
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:37.360]   point i think there was also some involvement of um you know the the professors um and and you know
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:43.280]   i guess there was i don't remember if like i'd i don't really find necessarily doing anything but
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:48.560]   i was traveling i think certainly i think they eventually did become more understanding and
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:55.120]   accommodating after some time i think maybe when they realized they couldn't really push me to you
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:00.560]   know do do these sorts of things no i mean yeah exactly like that the outcome that's not going to
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:09.120]   happen is the 13 year old that came like like a 19 year old because yeah i went to 19 year old
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:14.960]   yeah so there were certain things like that and then and then i mean of course there's like a
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.720]   i think there was going to be a similar situation with a lot of the the research that i would like
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:27.440]   undergraduate research um expectations to to to be in the lab for you know some a significant
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:32.160]   amount of time but i think that was more it's certainly a struggle with kind of balance more
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:37.760]   with balancing that with the classwork and things like that yeah i mean it sounds like quite often
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:45.600]   you were almost expected or required to you were held to a higher standard than the other
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.520]   folks like you described earlier with like how to get a's in your you know yeah in college
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.240]   certainly there was higher standards but then certainly there were also like maybe
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:04.880]   standards that you would expect of a normal student but you know my situation is different
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:09.600]   and maybe those are not the same status that apply i think there's also that aspect of things
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:15.600]   so it's not necessarily fire you know just generally but maybe maybe higher and for my
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:21.040]   particular situation um again that's the same point in terms of like getting fellowships and
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:27.360]   stuff like that you know my situation was completely different well you know maybe it's not
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:33.040]   as comparable to the situation of regular students but that is what all the you know application
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:39.520]   committees considered and you know for that reason i didn't get any any uh fellowships apart from one
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.440]   internal fellowship from uc davis but i went into grad school um and similarly and also with
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.880]   scholarships it was very hard for me to get scholarships and i so in term and i think yeah
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:58.240]   like certainly there's i think that that was also yeah basically there is that period basically
[02:57:58.240 --> 02:58:03.520]   with between sort of like yeah as i was finishing up undergrad kind of coming you know dealing with
[02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:08.960]   all the senior design kind of tension and going into grad school maybe um trying to figure out
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:14.880]   what is the next step and then trying to find a lab um because you know there was you know i had
[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:19.600]   planned to join this particular lab and yeah again there was another issue again things like um
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:28.240]   rotations lab rotations and stuff again there just was again expectations um and i guess i
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:33.520]   wasn't able to to meet those expectations it was hard working that out there was again some tension
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:38.800]   in that scenario i remember one rotation didn't work out because of some tension with one of
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:43.840]   the the project scientists at postdocs or something like that so there was like you know at that time
[02:58:43.840 --> 02:58:47.760]   there was a lot of like attention and definitely some concern about like what lab am i going to
[02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:54.480]   join and so actually in reality i joined a lot quite late actually compared to you know most
[02:58:54.480 --> 02:58:58.880]   phd students um because so what was that so the tension you referred to like what
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:05.200]   what did that look like what was what was happening it was more like um i don't know it was like
[02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:16.160]   just trying to the the tension was more uh again lots of these are hands-on labs um there there's
[02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:24.480]   expectation to be there you know from 9 a.m to 9 p.m or whatever um and so i guess in you
[02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:29.440]   know at the time that that wasn't something then you know again i'm like only 14 or something
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:36.400]   yeah and then also there's this there's also you know classwork and other things um but certainly
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:44.000]   yeah and then it i guess certainly there may have been also some prejudice in terms of age
[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:51.280]   as well you know i don't like it's not it's not a word prejudice and not going to like show it
[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:57.680]   very clearly but i felt like that probably is still yeah that that under but i mean and that's
[02:59:57.680 --> 03:00:06.080]   part of the tough thing about prejudice and being different is it's almost it's very very rare you
[03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:11.680]   can actually definitively point at something and say this was due to prejudice but at the same time
[03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:18.080]   there's always going to be a big part of you wondering which i think yeah this is what like
[03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:23.520]   my mom is always like oh they might be like my mom always thinks like folks are predators about
[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:27.520]   like certain things but like like if you think about like yes my mom is probably right but like
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:32.720]   you don't want to like believe like how can everyone be like that but like you know it turns
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:38.160]   out like guys people do tend to sometimes feel first and i think the scene is like true now for
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:44.320]   my old for my sister you know she's in this sort of very competitive field oh wow and music music
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:48.560]   and in singing where you know there's a limited response and like you know trying to positions
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:52.960]   and you know she's very young and it's like uh you know she's trying to get positions and it's
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:56.960]   it's very difficult and there's definitely a lot of that bias and prejudice happening there as well
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:04.720]   and um so you know my mom is always like calling that out and you know it's like you know it's
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:10.320]   probably true um there's probably a lot of that happening um then you just but you just kind of
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:14.880]   don't want to believe like how can people actually be like that but it's just you know people all
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:25.760]   like that so yes they are yeah yeah um okay so let's talk about the the phd um i mean let's
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:33.840]   yeah let's keep kind of going chronologically so yeah it was hard to find a lab and yeah but what
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:39.360]   happened how did you yeah find something and what did you find so like again like the plan was like
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:44.000]   okay i was doing some lab rotations but then i was like the backup was still the synthetic
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.800]   biology lab but then eventually i was like oh but then i'm like okay i did some i did a couple
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:54.720]   lab rotations and as i said a couple dropped out as well and then um this this then i was like going
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:58.880]   back to this synthetic biology lab then he was like actually didn't really want to have you on board
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:05.440]   or um you know he wasn't interested in having me in the lab anymore um and this is after me like
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:12.000]   i mean i was in the lab the same lab for the entirety of like my undergrad right so i was
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:18.000]   in there for two years then even the summer after i graduated it was like if you're going to be in
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:23.760]   my lab i want you to spend a few more months doing some hands-on work so i spent like my uh you know
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:29.040]   like two or three months in the summer also working in his lab even after that and he was like
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:35.040]   he didn't feel my research output was that great or you know it was not it was not as and he didn't
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:40.240]   feel like his the environment that he was providing was going to be the best environment for me which
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:45.760]   i don't know if that was true yeah it sounds like maybe they had um kind of made that decision
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:54.640]   already and it was possible i think i think you know yeah that may be possible um but you know
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:59.280]   maybe that it is it may have also been possible like if they were in that lab it probably it might
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:03.600]   not have been the best environment for me anyway so well i was going to ask i mean it it seems like
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:12.240]   computational biology is a seems like a fairly natural fit you know which is kind of like
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:17.520]   what you're doing now right you know it's like neural nets and whatnot and not not a whole lot of
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:23.760]   you know preparing hazardous materials he wanted me to do was like like so my undergrad research
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:29.520]   was mostly a lot of computation biology but his lab is technically a synthetic biology lab so um
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:34.080]   and then i think he wanted me to do some yeah yeah i mean i also was like yeah i don't know if
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:39.360]   i could use computational biology for the entire PhD so he wanted me to you know i see first play
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:46.240]   around and do things like that um in the lab and so it was it still it was still a mostly synthetic
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:50.480]   biology lab where you have to do lots of hands-on work and you know the students are there from
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:55.200]   again nine nine a half to nine pm and you know they're working long hours trying to get their
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:03.440]   experiments to to work um so yeah so i don't know in reality maybe you know it was it might not have
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:09.280]   been the best um yeah so what happened so where did you have to where'd you go and how did that
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:14.880]   happen yeah so then i was like then then that lab said no i was kind of like really like what am i
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:21.280]   gonna do um i was like that was my backup and i absolutely didn't work um and then um then i was
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:25.520]   like what about doing some machine learning because at this point you know i started you
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:31.600]   know taking the fast a course so this is i mean this was in um well like early 2019 so like yeah
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:36.320]   so i guess most people watching will know this but so the first day our course is my deep learning
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:43.840]   course yes and so you are an alum of that course which isn't entirely online and so how old were
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:50.640]   you when you started that course and and and and why why did you start that course so i must have
[03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:56.560]   been 14 when i started the course um i was i think i was just very interested in machine learning
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:01.600]   because it was just a hot topic at the time and i think um so like i attempted to learn yeah i
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:06.320]   guess it's kind of going now into my machine learning path um but i so i first so like i
[03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:10.400]   think i may have seen like things like kaggle and stuff like that i was like oh it was kind of really
[03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:16.880]   cool so this has been in 2016 um so i like this is it so it was like you know well i checked out
[03:05:16.880 --> 03:05:21.600]   kaggle i took oh so sorry i'm just gonna keep filling in things again i guess most people are
[03:05:21.600 --> 03:05:27.760]   going to know these things but um so kaggle is the main uh kind of international competition
[03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:33.120]   platform for machine learning practitioners where i used to you know i was the president and chief
[03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:38.720]   scientist when it was started so yeah sorry to try to keep interrupting you no worries yeah yeah
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:43.280]   um and the funny thing is like you know when you start with kaggle it's like oh like you know i
[03:05:43.280 --> 03:05:46.960]   think there's probably like you know i mean when you first see it you're like oh there's these are
[03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:51.200]   competitions and you can get we can win money and it's like oh wow it's so cool but then like you
[03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:55.360]   basically like and it's not about the money it's just about the experience and learning so yeah i
[03:05:55.360 --> 03:06:01.520]   think it's pretty cool like oh wow okay but then like you go into it it's like okay it's you know
[03:06:01.520 --> 03:06:05.920]   it's more about the experience that it's very hard to you know and part of it and the community
[03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:11.920]   perhaps i mean there's a lot of you know people helping each other and stuff yeah and there's a
[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:18.240]   lot you can learn from from from kaggle and so so this is in 2016 actually so this is even before
[03:06:18.240 --> 03:06:25.200]   i went into my bachelors right before i went to uc davis right so i checked out kaggle i then
[03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:29.760]   decided i'm going to learn some machine learning so i actually took anorene's course sarah course
[03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:34.800]   they're green so i took that um so that's like one of the again one of the leading
[03:06:34.800 --> 03:06:41.360]   machine learning courses i think grand sarah was originally founded to to right that course yeah
[03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:49.120]   with uh daphne color yeah yeah it's a really good course um and yes but like i think that's again
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:55.920]   still more like um from the basis kind of it's a bit more of an academic approach yeah it's more
[03:06:55.920 --> 03:07:01.760]   pregnant like uh yeah like a typical approach and i feel like it didn't really help my you know
[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:06.800]   more of the practical side of things right so you know i still like playing around with kaggle but
[03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:12.000]   like i feel i'm like not like i felt like i was my skills were not progressing anywhere i'm not like
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:16.240]   improving in terms of you know copy you know how i'm doing competition is nothing like that
[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:20.720]   i feel like i'm not going about this the right way so i in fact took a break from kaggle and
[03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:27.440]   you know exploring that um for a bit then i think i just at one point i decided to visit it again
[03:07:27.440 --> 03:07:33.200]   in like 20 late 2018 and i was seeing some nice kaggle notebooks so just to i guess it fell in
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:37.840]   again a lot of the lot of the um on the kaggle platform and especially with a lot of the
[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:43.600]   complications people will post um you know example code and you can run that code and play around
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:48.160]   with it right and you know like it's like in a jupiter a lot a lot of times jupiter notebook so
[03:07:48.160 --> 03:07:52.880]   it's got you know a lot of explanations and things like that as well so it's it's a very good to also
[03:07:52.880 --> 03:07:57.760]   just go over a lot of these notebooks if you know just for learning purposes um so i think i'm just
[03:07:57.760 --> 03:08:03.360]   kind of interested in what's out there and i and i've known you have ended up becoming one of the
[03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:08.960]   only notebook grandmasters in the world on that oh yeah that's curious basically i i really like
[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:15.200]   creating notebooks and again me too i am also one of those notebook grandmasters i'm a notebook
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:20.960]   grandmaster and um a lot of it was using the fasta library and it's funny because that's where i first
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:26.720]   discovered like the fasta library was oh okay notebooks and i think it may have been like by
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:31.920]   i think iphos it's one of those one of those again he's again like notebook grandmaster and he was i
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:37.520]   think he wanted the notebooks he was using fastai and then the notebook did very well in in the
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:42.000]   competition as well and i was like okay this is very interesting and it looks very simple but it's
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:47.520]   like doing very well and i should check out this fastai stuff more and i actually remembered that
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:52.160]   i once saw fastai on twitter or something like this and they had this course and like i was like
[03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:56.320]   thinking about looking into that course a bit and i think they may have watched like the first lecture
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:00.320]   or at least maybe the first 30 minutes of the first lecture or something like that and i decided maybe
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:06.080]   i should dig into it more so i found so this was in by late 2018 i'm just giving like a whole
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:13.680]   timeline of everything it's yeah it's like it's great i love it um and um then i i took um i was
[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:19.920]   so i was i went to the lectures but i think that i went to like the first two lectures but then
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:23.840]   right after that i think you released a new course i think or something like that so then it's like
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:29.120]   okay um so i think yeah i think you like released a new course a new part one version of the course
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:32.320]   or whatever so then i was like i'm just going to go through that so then i went through the entire
[03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:39.920]   course and um at the same time so you did part two as well part one and part two yeah so i did part one
[03:09:39.920 --> 03:09:47.280]   was released um you had you had it released right to the whole public then i went through part one
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:53.040]   i was participating in the forums you know asking my own question answering other people's questions
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.760]   then as i was also going through part one i looked at some cattle competitions um there was one like
[03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:04.800]   i think it all like uh one of the audio classification competitions man i kind of like
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:10.160]   participated with that and um you know i was like i was so actually you know at the end of the
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:14.560]   competition i was actually very close to brown's metal i think i may have missed like by like five
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:19.040]   spots or something like that but like so like it's kind of disappointing but also like i feel like i
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:23.120]   was doing so much better than i was before and i think like a lot of what i learned from fasta
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:28.480]   i really kind of you know provide lots of useful skills and then on top of that i was also playing
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:33.520]   around with um you know i decided well i'm interested of course in biomedical engineering
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:40.160]   medicine general so i decided to take a medical AI dataset so i looked at uh diabetic retinopathy
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:47.280]   which is like in a rarity oftentimes they're you know imaging the the eye um the whole um set up
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:53.600]   um it was actually yeah so this is this is diagnosing diabetes through eye images which is
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:59.200]   very much a thing and something that it turns out mainly thanks to that competition we've discovered
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:04.640]   that computers are extremely good at yeah exactly so this was yeah there's a older competition and
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:08.480]   so i just took the data from that and was just playing around with you know models on that and
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:12.400]   stuff all and it kind of did in a systematic approach for you know the stuff that i'm learning
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:17.600]   the fasta class i'll apply it and so that's kind of how i went through the course and did you then
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:23.280]   do the part two as well i did the part two line so i think i was invited through your kind of i
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:28.320]   guess your fellowship program whatever okay you should listen to the forums and so i did part two
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:34.320]   actually alive you know with the live streams so for those who aren't familiar like the part one
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:40.560]   course of fasta is kind of the introductory beginner level i mean it does take people up to
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:48.480]   kind of world-class best practices but of specific fairly well-developed and understood applications
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:57.520]   whereas part two is cutting edge research level reading papers implementing papers trying out
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:04.000]   new things that haven't existed before so it's a you know um lots of teenagers do part one i think
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:12.640]   not many teenagers do part two yeah so yeah that was a really fun experience um and the other thing
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:17.520]   was like i feel like i also learned a lot of like you know just general software engineering and
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:24.960]   both of these courses which is also really really useful and really helpful um but then so that was
[03:12:24.960 --> 03:12:30.720]   part two which ended i think maybe somewhere in the main or something like that um so that was
[03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:37.280]   around the time when also you know i was like in this kind of struggle to find a lab and so
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:42.160]   you know i i really enjoyed both and was that the one i'm trying to remember was that the one where
[03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:50.320]   we did all the super resolution stuff with jason and tick or was that the year afterwards um i think
[03:12:50.320 --> 03:12:55.120]   it may have been or no i'm just asking because i know i know you've you know ended up in image
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:13:00.640]   reconstruction from microscopy i think it might be the year before it might have been the year before
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:07.280]   down we are was i think the year let's see i think it wouldn't have been it would have been that oh
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.720]   wait no no no sorry that was actually part one 2019 was when we did it yeah yeah so i think this
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:20.320]   is the year that we had the swift stuffing think no after 2019 no that was 2019 as well i think uh
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:29.280]   it was oh gosh it's all clarity after 2019 did you do another part two i don't think so right
[03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:37.440]   you did 2020 2020 didn't have a part two and then 2021 kind of 2021 didn't even have a part one
[03:13:37.440 --> 03:13:44.160]   yeah so that it was 2019 then that was the one with the swift and so i don't think it covered um
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:48.720]   super resolution stuff no no no well uh actually the super resolution stuff actually was in part
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:54.560]   one of the course believe it or not it was lesson seven oh okay oh okay that may be right okay yeah
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:14:03.520]   i'm just looking at course 18.fast.ai to remind myself part two here we go oh okay so a lot of
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:07.760]   stuff that would be relevant to you we did cyclegans that's been cyclegans came out
[03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:15.120]   direct transfer our way did so first lot of super resolution actually was the end lesson 14 of 2018
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:20.320]   so so people who are not familiar with the field this will all be total mumbo jumbo but basically
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:25.680]   it's little very strongly related to the i mean cyclegans in particular is like literally what
[03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:33.520]   you research now right yeah out of it but i actually took course 2019 so that was okay but
[03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:38.000]   i definitely didn't look at a lot of those lectures still um you know because that because i definitely
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:45.200]   knew about the super resolution stuff i think yes okay so 2019 lesson seven was when we did the
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:50.560]   really full-on super resolution okay so then maybe that's what i saw then that may be what i saw um
[03:14:50.560 --> 03:15:00.720]   we did gans we did yeah um so so yeah at that point i was like okay um you know i'm really
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:05.440]   liking the deep learning stuff i even like a lot of my twitter feed became about deep learning and
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:10.240]   it's following a lot of these books and the deep learning field and that that that sphere and so
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:15.760]   so do you want to quickly describe what deep learning is and what it does okay
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:21.440]   again i guess most people will know but just uh you know make sure nobody's left behind
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:27.440]   you want me to explain or you want to yeah i want you to explain oh okay i don't know i can say
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:34.880]   things as well but uh i guess that's a good job i mean of course you know you're all about ai um and
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:42.080]   then this is kind of a sub subset of of artificial intelligence ai where you know you apply these
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:48.480]   neural networks as they call them but they're really just very um so very flexible functions
[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:55.120]   i guess that um you're able to quote unquote train by you know passing in data so it's just
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:00.800]   a kind of a different framework altogether and in terms of programming usually you write down some
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:07.360]   rules and algorithms and then you write on data and you get your results but in this case you
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:13.040]   take data and you pass it into your neural networks and you run these sorts of training
[03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:18.480]   processes uh and then you get this sort of neural network at the end that is just learned how to do
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:23.840]   things yeah and learns how to do things that you can't write the code for the way i describe to
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:28.240]   people is it's basically deep learning is like the thing that's responsible for pretty much every
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:36.160]   amazing breakthrough in ai in the last few years yeah you know the fact that your phone you can
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:43.200]   speak to it that is thanks to deep learning the fact that you can search your you know your photos
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:46.800]   for pictures of cats even though you didn't say which ones have cats in that's thanks to deep
[03:16:46.800 --> 03:16:54.960]   learning yeah yeah all those superpowers yeah okay so you yeah so you started doing this before
[03:16:56.320 --> 03:17:03.360]   before even settling on a phd before yeah before like you know yeah i started i was dabbling in
[03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:07.520]   machine learning for a while but then when i took the fast ci course that's when i became really
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:12.880]   focused on this and i decided okay if i'm not joining this synthetic biology lab then maybe
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:18.480]   i can join a something more machine learning focused so again i found another lab i did a
[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:23.760]   rotation in that lab unfortunately also that didn't work out so then this has by this is
[03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:28.720]   actually um you know this is a yeah this is a machine learning lab but again i guess it was just
[03:17:28.720 --> 03:17:33.680]   not um a good fit i think it was more of a like a more like like it was still kind of maybe more
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:38.960]   likely biology and things like that but that was more i think i was still more interested in more
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:44.640]   like medical aspects of of stuff there's like more applied i think maybe that's also kind of
[03:17:44.640 --> 03:17:50.240]   there was you know maybe the the fit in terms of the research ideas and projects that i was
[03:17:50.240 --> 03:17:59.680]   interested in maybe it wasn't really there so then at this point this is like end of summer of 2019
[03:17:59.680 --> 03:18:06.720]   and most people you don't get there they joined a lab like you know if you know if they if they
[03:18:06.720 --> 03:18:11.680]   people in my batch they would have joined a lab in like march and i'm like right behind here
[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:16.400]   um so i even had special meetings so were you feeling a bit worried at this point
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:21.280]   i am very worried that yeah i'm extremely worried my parents are worried what are we going to do
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:26.800]   like um and so like i even met with the chair of the grad group a couple times
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:35.680]   and then the chair at uc davis yes at uc davis um and then you know he he mentioned a couple of
[03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:41.200]   uh labs another couple of lecture about the labs that do are doing more medical research
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:47.600]   with machine learning um and then um then he was like and then he was like this this there's this
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:52.960]   one lab that's also going to be joining it at the grad so it hasn't actually joined the grad
[03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:58.640]   yet but it's going to join the grad this coming up year uh and there was also he was like okay
[03:18:58.640 --> 03:19:02.800]   maybe there's also the other labs on campus which if you're not part of the grad group and they may
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:07.280]   be able to join the grad group if that's something you're interested in um because we were like maybe
[03:19:07.280 --> 03:19:10.800]   there's not there's not many good labs even in within the grad groups there are other labs
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.560]   that university that i could join but they could maybe join the grad group so we kind of figured
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:20.720]   out all kinds of situations but still mostly focused on doing ai research because i figured
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:25.440]   yeah that was what i wanted to so and then there was like a couple labs that i you know i met with
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:32.480]   the the the professors and then i finally got to meet my current professor and like he was
[03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:37.200]   joining the research and i thought it was quite interesting and i felt like again it's like a
[03:19:37.200 --> 03:19:42.720]   medical research that was more directly applicable right this is like microscopy and pathology and
[03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:49.280]   it's like actually talking you know working with how specimens in the clinic are being handled and
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:54.000]   examined and it's like if if i can do good research in this this is something that would have
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:58.560]   you know a positive impact more directly at least that's how i felt at the time and i mean
[03:19:58.560 --> 03:20:02.320]   i still feel that way but i'm saying that's yeah that's you know how you know how it how it looks
[03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:06.240]   like it when i was looking at this research and you know almost immediately i was like yeah this
[03:20:06.240 --> 03:20:12.640]   is a good lab i i really i this seems like there's lots of great um deforming opportunities and i
[03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:19.040]   immediately kind of said i'm going to join this lab um i didn't even do a rotation or anything
[03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:23.840]   and i was like yeah i'm going to join this lab and he was like yeah so what's what what's the
[03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:28.400]   name of the lab and who's who are we talking about that's running it yes this is a doctor
[03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:35.120]   richard levenson uh which uh yeah he's a um a professor of pathology so he actually has a
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:43.680]   background in pathology um so he he did his md um a while back like i think in the 70s so this is
[03:20:43.680 --> 03:20:49.360]   like a long time and then after that he you know went and just to clarify again for people not sure
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:56.400]   so pathology my late person's explanation is like kind of like looking at things like biopsies and
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:01.440]   whatnot you know under under a slide you know maybe staining it a bit and and looking at the
[03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:09.280]   cells and so forth trying to you know do a diagnosis and so forth is that roughly like
[03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:15.040]   if you need to yeah oftentimes too especially things like where you know the cellular information
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:19.760]   like the actual cells in in the body you know matter if you need to take those sorts of samples
[03:21:19.760 --> 03:21:24.960]   and then you know analyze it under a microscope yeah and pathology covers other things as well
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:28.720]   of course like blood tests and whatnot but i think your work is mainly around the medical
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:34.720]   imaging side of pathology histopathology especially like for example a lot of it like cancer
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:41.120]   but i mean we do of course there's still other um areas but a very common application is looking at
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:45.520]   you know different cancers and you know you know getting biopsies of different cancers and
[03:21:45.520 --> 03:21:50.080]   examining them under the microscope and providing a diagnosis that's a very common application but
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:57.280]   there's still and so this is like okay so like i um i had already come across you
[03:21:57.280 --> 03:22:06.880]   through our forums so fastai has a very bustling forum community of deep learning nerds like me
[03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:16.880]   and tenish um and i i'd never spoken to you directly but i you know interacted with you
[03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:22.480]   on various threads and yeah didn't i had no idea why because like for a long time i had no idea
[03:22:22.480 --> 03:22:29.120]   who you were i think they had a sense that you were like surprisingly young maybe or even i'm
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:34.080]   not even sure i knew that i mean i get my profile like for a long time actually pretty
[03:22:34.080 --> 03:22:39.040]   and like an anonymous profile so like i didn't actually put any information about myself on most
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.560]   of the uh machine learning like even on caggle with stuff like that i actually kept myself
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:48.320]   pretty anonymous for a while because you know something that's interesting also just interacting
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:54.000]   with people online i think you know is that basically so there would be no kind of expectations
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:59.040]   or prejudice or anything but just interact with you for your work and nothing else or was it more
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:04.160]   accidental like um i mean i think it was like especially my you know i think it's something
[03:23:04.160 --> 03:23:08.720]   you hear from you like if my i heard you know you hear from my parents from like you know just
[03:23:08.720 --> 03:23:14.000]   be careful who you're interacting with online and like you know yeah don't put a lot of you don't
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:21.040]   want to put too much information so like at the most most of my sort of like public communication
[03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:25.840]   for you know my identity was there it was mostly through twitter and facebook and they kind of
[03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:32.320]   mostly everywhere else i was pretty much anonymous just it was more kind of like yeah for safety uh
[03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:39.280]   you know for that purpose but i um but i didn't know your supervisor richard because um i had
[03:23:39.280 --> 03:23:48.720]   started a medical AI company a few years earlier and um medical imaging became our focus and
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:53.920]   histopathology was something we were interested in looking into and respect to richard because
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:24:03.600]   he was doing really interesting work there and then before my first chat to him one of
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:10.880]   my colleagues said like you know i think i read something about this guy something to do with
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:17.200]   pigeons and i like looked up richard lewinson pigeons and like oh my god he's he's taught
[03:24:17.200 --> 03:24:24.880]   pigeons to diagnose disease certainly histopathological slides it's just remarkable
[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:31.600]   yeah he's like sometimes like to say AI stands for avian intelligence because of the pigeons
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:35.680]   because he i mean and he ended up the pigeons got roughly the same level of
[03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:43.600]   accuracy as yeah expert pathologists you see things like for example like use multiple pigeons
[03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:47.440]   and average out to predictions around it gets better it's like it's funny because like techniques
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:52.880]   an ensemble of pigeons yeah exactly an ensemble of pigeons i mean that's something so he's obviously
[03:24:52.880 --> 03:25:00.560]   okay so like based on the fact that a he attempted to replace human pathologists with pigeons and b
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:10.880]   he brought under his wing a kid to supervise on a phd he's obviously open-minded yes he is and all
[03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:19.680]   crazy or something yeah i think yeah he's um he's got unique ideas like ideas you know a lot of
[03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:26.080]   people don't tend to think about and um i think that's yeah and you can see that like with his
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:33.360]   career like he's got a very um different career right like his career was you know he did MD but
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:39.680]   he never like really was much of a practicing pathologist in fact or that he like a professor
[03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:43.680]   but then like after that he went into industry and he was actually working a lot in like
[03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:48.880]   hyperspectral cameras and stuff like that so he was doing a lot of optics actually right and then
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:53.920]   even you know at his time in these companies working in this field he actually started
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:57.920]   applying neural networks so like very basic you know perceptrons which is like the basic
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:02.320]   sort of neural networks like very basic that was he was already applying this must have been in like
[03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:07.440]   early 2000s so he has some he already had actually some you know machine learning
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:14.960]   experience from that side of things um so i mean but like you know he's got a very unique path through
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:19.840]   you know through you know doing math going through medical school and becoming you know
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:24.720]   this professor and then doing industry and eventually he was like you know he says like
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:30.800]   he got i guess he got called to join EC Davis and he just joined EC Davis. So Tanishk what was it
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:40.000]   like when you met him? Um i mean he was certainly a very um he was a very uh interesting but very
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:45.200]   friendly character right he was like you know and he was like you know huge he had he has like the
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:49.920]   pigeon poster there and you know we have it in the hallway of our lab and so he's like showing that
[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:54.960]   and he's showing of course the research and so you know you know he was very excited to show
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:27:01.440]   and then we just connected about other things too like he also was like he's got like in like a
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:06.480]   musical background so of course um he i think was also like in the San Francisco boys chorus just
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:11.440]   like i was you know yeah which we hadn't talked about right so yeah you're piano and choir right
[03:27:11.440 --> 03:27:19.200]   is your yeah i did i did choir when i was younger i played piano a bit and like when i was again
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:23.920]   really young then i think i just can't i i you have half of them i kind of stopped and like
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:29.360]   never really like pursued that any further i know that feeling yeah which i think my president like
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:36.160]   oh no like i mean you know we spent a lot of money on those things but like yeah i i remember
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:42.160]   when i was like 13 or something and i i said very earnestly to my mom like i want to stop doing
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:46.240]   piano lessons i've done them since i was like seven and she was like are you sure you know one
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:51.040]   day you might look back and regret that because it's like you know and i was like no i'm absolutely
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:57.600]   sure i have no interest and now i look back and i regret that i think not that i've told mom i
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:03.280]   wouldn't admit it to her unless she watches this but you know yeah um like parallel is like yeah
[03:28:03.280 --> 03:28:08.480]   something like i don't know like i guess like yeah i mean of course still know like base very basic
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:15.280]   stuff of course but like i don't like choir is something like i think i think now it's like
[03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:20.080]   at the time like yeah definitely i think i want to continue at the time so like i wasn't far from
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:25.520]   like maybe five years old to ten years old something like that so i was there for like
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:35.360]   five years or whatever um and i was so i was there for quite some time and um and so yeah i
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:42.880]   was i kind of wanted to continue but then the thing was i became a full-time student so i'm
[03:28:42.880 --> 03:28:47.840]   like a full-time student where i was taking you know i graduated high school and i went to community
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:52.400]   college now as a full-time student taking multiple classes per semester as opposed to standard two
[03:28:52.400 --> 03:28:58.080]   classes so it wasn't working because this is in you know san francisco and i live in sacramento
[03:28:58.080 --> 03:29:03.360]   and it was like a hour and a half drive up well you know both ways it's like three hours just
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:09.760]   driving and this is like two days a week so that's like six hours in a week is just got gone in and
[03:29:09.760 --> 03:29:15.360]   you know just you know in the car and you know that was so it was like there's a lot of time
[03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:19.920]   commitment you know even just the regular classes were like again like two hours and then the like
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:25.680]   if when you get closer to the actual concerts or like multiple rehearsals because like sevens
[03:29:25.680 --> 03:29:31.440]   voice courses like one of the top voice courses in the world right but actually like san francisco
[03:29:31.440 --> 03:29:35.440]   voice course and like the Vienna voice courses something like that like these are like top
[03:29:35.440 --> 03:29:42.080]   courses in like voice courses in the world so like they're very top-notch and very professional and
[03:29:42.080 --> 03:29:46.960]   so and actually i got a it's you know i actually got to sing like for example aisles are saying
[03:29:46.960 --> 03:29:55.040]   that the the national anthem at the giants game actually wow i had no idea yeah so even i i've
[03:29:55.040 --> 03:29:59.840]   sung the national anthem and also for the oakland so maybe you and your sister can swap some time
[03:29:59.840 --> 03:30:08.400]   and she can start doing the fast ai course and yeah but like so i an event like i think yeah
[03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:13.120]   that's kind of where my sister like became really passionate about music actually because she
[03:30:13.120 --> 03:30:19.040]   sometimes coming into a lot of my you know classes you know my my maybe you know my mom is driving
[03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:23.760]   me and she's taking my sister along and my sister really was like enjoying that she's like why can't
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:30.720]   i sing in the the chorus of like it's a voice chorus oh you can just so um um but then she
[03:30:30.720 --> 03:30:33.600]   became really passionate about music at that point i mean she's you know it's already kind
[03:30:33.600 --> 03:30:37.440]   of playing around with like singing like that she's not like why can't i train neural nets
[03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:42.800]   that's how she felt like that unfortunately i would be happy just like that but that's not
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:50.480]   no but um yeah so actually in a way like that kind of maybe jumps maybe helps with her
[03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:55.840]   you know interest in that so you know i think there's some benefit but um but then i think so
[03:30:55.840 --> 03:31:01.680]   like i was finished yeah as i went into community college i couldn't take this it was not working
[03:31:01.680 --> 03:31:06.480]   out in terms of the time commitment and stuff so i stopped but i at the time obviously as something
[03:31:06.480 --> 03:31:11.280]   i was pretty kind of i wasn't i was kind of sad about it but like i you know i definitely
[03:31:11.280 --> 03:31:16.480]   realized that you know like the community college is you know more important to me so you know that
[03:31:16.480 --> 03:31:20.880]   was a worthwhile sacrifice for me but like you know there was still like some aspect of it anyway
[03:31:20.880 --> 03:31:26.000]   so this was something you had in common with with richard yeah yes that was something i had in
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:31.840]   common um and then he also has like uh like he knew like i think he knows some of him he knew
[03:31:31.840 --> 03:31:36.320]   like relatives of like one of the these famous composers and stuff and he's just like a generally
[03:31:36.320 --> 03:31:41.360]   also like a musically minded person like goes to a lot of the concerts at UC Davis and things like
[03:31:41.360 --> 03:31:46.000]   that so we were just kind of connecting over that too and especially you know you know how my sister
[03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:51.600]   is also very interested in that kind of field and so was that like a pretty like did that all go
[03:31:51.600 --> 03:31:55.760]   pretty smoothly then like you guys connected and it's like okay this is obviously going to happen
[03:31:56.640 --> 03:32:02.880]   yeah a good connection and um so yeah i think at that point it was definitely something like yeah
[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:06.560]   the funniest thing was like so he was talking about the cyclic ion research because like this
[03:32:06.560 --> 03:32:10.960]   is something like he was interested in pursuing already so this was like something like he's
[03:32:10.960 --> 03:32:18.560]   interested he was interested because i think i spoke to you guys pretty early on right because
[03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:23.600]   we were already interested in pursuing that yeah so that was like he was like already like let's do
[03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:29.360]   this and i remember we had a call and he was like oh you might know this guy he's you know from your
[03:32:29.360 --> 03:32:36.480]   community and i was like oh yeah i got to kind of yeah so so yeah immediately he was like already
[03:32:36.480 --> 03:32:39.840]   interested in psychodat stuff but it's kind of fine because like up to that point i was playing
[03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:44.640]   around with all this classification and segmentation or what these like different machine learning tasks
[03:32:44.640 --> 03:32:49.920]   um and then um but like these sort of generative tasks which is like what the psychogas stuff like
[03:32:49.920 --> 03:32:56.560]   i was yeah so psychogan is like a technique for taking an image and turning it into a different
[03:32:56.560 --> 03:33:01.280]   image exactly and that would be very useful in particular in pathology if you could take an
[03:33:01.280 --> 03:33:09.760]   image which is easy fast and cheap to acquire and turn it into an image which is slow and
[03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:15.920]   expensive and difficult to acquire but has like useful features for diagnosis whatever is that
[03:33:15.920 --> 03:33:21.840]   exact kind of idea basically yeah describe the research in a nutshell that i do yes um so
[03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:28.000]   but like those were techniques i hadn't played around with in the past and you know honestly
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:31.600]   i didn't at the time i didn't find it that interesting but then then i was like you know
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:35.200]   what i'll give it a try and still deep learning and it's still gonna be i think it'll still be
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:39.360]   fun so i i mean that's what i decided like i didn't i wasn't actually expecting to like
[03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:43.920]   really i wasn't sure if it's something i'd actually enjoy but like i figured like it's
[03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:48.320]   deep learning and this is like still very cutting edge and you know again the application is what
[03:33:48.320 --> 03:33:52.960]   matters to me the most i think you know that it has a useful application at the end so i i decided
[03:33:52.960 --> 03:33:58.960]   to give it a try and now i'm like really all over this sort of generative um these sorts of you know
[03:33:58.960 --> 03:34:03.840]   machine learning tasks and so that was kind of funny um but yeah like it like you mentioned like
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:08.480]   this was something we wanted to do early on so like you say you know this is a project that i'm
[03:34:08.480 --> 03:34:13.360]   interested in he had some other projects too but this was like the one i figured like okay i'm i'm
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:17.520]   gonna give this one a try there's like one other project that he also suggested and i gave that a
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:23.120]   try but then i i didn't find it as interesting so this is the one that i really pursued uh and then
[03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:29.520]   and then i think i saw like for example i think i so i saw i think the talk with jason antich at
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:34.080]   like facebook or something i think that so i just discovered he's we we're meant to pronounce his
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:39.040]   name jason antich by the way so even though i've been butchering it for the last few years so yes
[03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:45.920]   okay jason antich being you know another fast ai alum who's gone on to great things he started a
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:51.760]   startup based on exactly these kind of techniques but um in his case it was taking black and white
[03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:57.600]   photos and taking them into color photos yeah so like i saw that talking i was like wait this was
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:02.480]   something that we talked about like in the lesson right and i was like well this is something that
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:07.840]   maybe would work well here and like these are some of the techniques that i think we should examine
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:15.520]   in and study um so i brought that up to to my to my best doctor lennison and he was like oh i know
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:21.120]   jeremy i was like wait hodinson jeremy and it's like it turns out like he knows like a lot of
[03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:25.280]   people right so he knows like i think he knows you yeah he knows you he knows um like he knows
[03:35:25.280 --> 03:35:30.320]   daphne coleur oh yeah she's the one who's doing like also i think i think she's doing pathology
[03:35:30.320 --> 03:35:35.440]   stuff too now yes she was so she was involved in the computational pathologist seed path project
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:41.520]   stanford with andy beck well but i think the the startup that she's working on is still also um
[03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:45.200]   i think it's called in citro or something like that yeah that's right she ended up doing
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:53.040]   after after co-founding corsera she then founded a part of the thing at google's yeah yeah so she
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:58.720]   was you know she was so she you know it was kind of hard and he knows a lot of people in the field
[03:35:58.720 --> 03:36:02.640]   not just like in pathology but in deep learning and like in all these different fields i'm like
[03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:06.240]   wait yeah that's another that's another great thing about having you know the sort of pi he's
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:10.960]   very well connected which is also really nice to have like you know it's good to have or you know
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:15.840]   well connected and get you the resources that you need so like even you know of course like you know
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:19.760]   there are researchers who are you know the the leading researchers in the field so like he knows
[03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:25.760]   all the computational pathology researchers like pretty much all of them and so like so how old
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:31.440]   would you have been at that time when we were on that call together with richard yeah i mean like
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:42.640]   15 maybe 14 15 yeah so so i mean like i um the thing i've really noticed about you tanish in
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:54.640]   the last four years um is like how much you've developed as a person um like really i mean you
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:59.520]   know what i think of you because i've actually said it publicly in the fast air course you know
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:05.520]   you're i think you're incredible like i mean obviously smart and hard working but also
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:17.200]   thoughtful and generous and kind and fair um yeah and you know i honestly when i was first chatting
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:25.680]   to you i kind of felt like you were pretty raw you know you were you you um you're you know nice
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:31.920]   enough guy and certainly smart and good to work with but i i i wouldn't have kind of put you up
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:39.600]   as one of the you know uh in the same way but like over the last four years it seems to me like you've
[03:37:39.600 --> 03:37:48.560]   really grown out as a person into somebody who's who's who's very special uh as very special human
[03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:56.960]   being um it like do you feel like you've been looking like that as i'm you know living my life
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:38:02.640]   so that's very interesting to hear for sure like yeah no it's quite striking for me uh
[03:38:02.640 --> 03:38:08.800]   you know and i and and interesting to like i you know whether it's like is it just
[03:38:08.800 --> 03:38:14.880]   you know there's actually a lot of years between being a 15 year old and a 19 year old but also
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:23.840]   like working you know on a doctorate you're you're part of a team and people are relying
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:33.120]   on you and you're having to navigate situations but not not as a precocious kid who's trying to
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:38.960]   force their way into things that hasn't been designed for them but as a colleague you know
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:44.480]   and um yeah so you know maybe there's just that that i don't know i don't know where i'm going
[03:38:44.480 --> 03:38:48.560]   with this but um i've been to hear what your thoughts are about the experience of like
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:55.040]   doing a phd and whether that was quite a yeah different experience to the before
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:38:59.520]   so actually this was back it's interesting you bring that up in terms of like being a kid who's
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:04.560]   like trying to do because like so like like even in bachelor's like at a certain point
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:10.320]   like people though most people don't realize like if they're meeting me for the first time
[03:39:10.320 --> 03:39:17.280]   they don't realize that i'm young like i mean oftentimes i'm not going to um mention that you
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:21.680]   know the first time like i'm gonna say hello i'm tanishan i'm 19 years old that's not how i'm gonna
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:24.800]   introduce especially because like directly related to research that's not obviously not
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:29.920]   how to do i mean even like yeah so even though i have bachelors i think like i've taken a couple
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:33.600]   classes where i went the entire class and no one knew you know anything about me and i was
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:38.800]   like that's fine i don't really care but like i think of course within the um within the actual
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:46.400]   my actual class of the the biomedical engineering batch or whatever um they all knew because you
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:50.000]   know that that news is going to spread up pretty quickly but outside of like you know taking other
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.720]   classes and stuff a lot of them didn't realize that i was so young and the same is true i think
[03:39:54.720 --> 03:40:02.160]   when i uh in my phd so yeah i mean i think like i think it was like i think yeah after like um
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:06.320]   basically like after 13 or 14 i think you know you don't really realize that you can if you look at
[03:40:06.320 --> 03:40:11.200]   me you don't realize that i think a lot of people don't realize i'm young i mean some people will
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:15.520]   still say you look kind of young and but they don't like you don't bring it up like oftentimes
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:19.360]   they'll bring it up until like sometimes maybe i might mention it in passing or something they're
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:24.480]   like wait you've been look you look young and you know that makes sense actually now like so uh but
[03:40:24.480 --> 03:40:31.200]   in my phd and i'm doing stuff you know most people don't realize my age i think there may be maybe a
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:36.480]   couple collaborators i don't know if they know my age or not like i never bring it up um and i just
[03:40:36.480 --> 03:40:41.600]   interact as i would um as a regular yes it's just a regular researcher i imagine that feels pretty
[03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:49.040]   good sorry i imagine that feels pretty good i mean you know because like it seems like you you had
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:59.440]   years of trying to prove that you deserve to be somewhere you know and kind of like and also like
[03:40:59.440 --> 03:41:06.080]   not really being able to quite do the same things in the same ways as everybody else um yeah that
[03:41:06.080 --> 03:41:13.680]   must be a real nice change yeah like yeah i felt yeah i definitely feel like um
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:19.360]   well i think there's still some i mean at this point it's like some of it is like um
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:27.280]   i do think like sometimes i worry if i'm like you know behind in terms of research uh output and
[03:41:27.280 --> 03:41:31.920]   things like that and still a concern that i do have i think i think it was i think it's less
[03:41:31.920 --> 03:41:38.080]   of concern now because like i'm seeing the end of the tunnel and i'm seeing like yeah i'm gonna get
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:43.920]   like you know a few papers and you know i've done like good research and but i think i mean i was
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:51.840]   beginning the the again beginning my phd and beginning the um in even that original phase in
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:57.920]   in dr lemonson's lab i was still kind of worried about that how's that research output gonna look
[03:41:57.920 --> 03:42:06.400]   like i mean those are all very normal phd reactions though it they are but also um
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:15.360]   yeah i don't well the other thing is like again you it just depends like yeah i think i think
[03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:19.920]   there's certainly a lot of like comparing to you know you compare to others and you kind of see
[03:42:19.920 --> 03:42:24.000]   it always seems like you know that's it's it's not the best thing to be doing but it's still
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:28.480]   like you know something that kind of naturally happens right like of course you know you should
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:33.520]   compare yourself to others you should be comparing yourself to yourself and yeah easy to say that's
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:38.560]   what that's what people say but it's still you know hard to you know practice what people are
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:44.480]   saying in terms yeah no i mean the people that say that probably don't practice so you know there's
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:49.760]   definitely still that aspect of things you know i'm seeing like my call you know my colleagues
[03:42:49.760 --> 03:42:54.640]   oh they've got like five ten papers like oh my gosh i only have like one or two and like
[03:42:54.640 --> 03:42:59.760]   the other thing is you know i'm definitely in this i'm in a different environment a lot of
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:05.040]   them have labs that you know have 10 20 people maybe you know even larger than that they're
[03:43:05.040 --> 03:43:11.280]   working a lot of collaborative projects in my case my lab was actually a very small lab actually i'm
[03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:17.920]   the only phd student in vol hab wow which is a very unique situation to be in um and what
[03:43:17.920 --> 03:43:23.520]   of and i'm actually uh dr ledinson's first phd student so we're actually operating at the same
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:32.320]   time so the phd you know process um so and then so you know there's it's a very good now you have
[03:43:32.320 --> 03:43:38.160]   quite a few papers to your name yeah i do have some papers so i'm i'm i'm definitely
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:42.800]   a little of you know proud proud of that and i'm seeing there and a book at least one book chapter
[03:43:42.800 --> 03:43:48.000]   that i'm aware of yes yeah that too which that was luckily something that you know i got that
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:53.760]   opportunity um you know shortly after i joined the lab so i was very happy about that um and so these
[03:43:53.760 --> 03:43:59.360]   sorts of opportunities definitely you know put my uh worries at rest um i mean you know still you
[03:43:59.360 --> 03:44:03.280]   kind of i still kind of worry about it once in a while but i definitely feel like i'm in a much
[03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:09.680]   better situation now um but you know apart from i mean yeah as you said those are probably regular
[03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:16.720]   phd worries but um yeah apart from that you know i'm definitely very satisfied i guess um the path
[03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:23.200]   that i've uh that i've been taking in terms of yeah the phd seems to be going all yeah it was
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:29.600]   like a regular phd and yeah the thing was except for the fact that you you know now also have
[03:44:30.640 --> 03:44:38.560]   a job um a very interesting and exciting job um yeah i i guess we're like i just i wanted to
[03:44:38.560 --> 03:44:45.840]   kind of ask like i just wanted to reach up one other thing yeah please i was going to say like
[03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:52.160]   but i really enjoy you know of course doing this sort of computational research right like it's
[03:44:52.160 --> 03:44:57.360]   very it works i think that's something that you know for the longest time i tried to do
[03:44:57.360 --> 03:45:02.720]   this sort of hands-on research and i guess that's just something that you know just doesn't maybe
[03:45:02.720 --> 03:45:08.560]   work as well for me but then the computational stuff it's very flexible um you know but i you
[03:45:08.560 --> 03:45:13.280]   know i just i can still get a lot of my work done wherever i am and it's really nice you know
[03:45:13.280 --> 03:45:18.560]   especially you know during the pandemic you know all the other students they couldn't complete any
[03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:24.560]   of their research and they just got down right so but i managed to still you know continue with
[03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:34.640]   my research actually absolutely but also like computational work like you you know you we
[03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:43.920]   create stuff that didn't previously exist out of raw code you know and we can create lots of things
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:51.680]   and we can try them and we can compare them and it's like such a act of creation you know
[03:45:51.680 --> 03:45:58.480]   and creating things is just magnificent but i'd like let's see it's that's how i feel about it
[03:45:58.480 --> 03:46:04.560]   yeah it's again like i think it's always good to like get external perspective on these sort of
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:09.680]   things because like you know as i do the research like you know it just feels like oh is this the
[03:46:09.680 --> 03:46:13.760]   research that i do on a day-to-day basis and it's like okay this is what i'm doing and like i'm also
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:17.840]   like you know analyzing the results it's like oh this is not perfect and like this is issues here
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:21.840]   and this issue is there and like oh i get to figure out how to improve it but then i like this
[03:46:21.840 --> 03:46:25.840]   there's this project i'm working on i'm working on with some collaborators and i'm showing these
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:30.480]   results to the collaborators and they're like this is this is amazing and this is like stuff that
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:35.680]   wasn't possible before and like this is like you know you couldn't you couldn't you couldn't really
[03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:41.360]   get you know these sorts of images ever right like because this collaborator that we're working with
[03:46:41.360 --> 03:46:45.840]   and it's like actually doing in vivo imaging or kind of like that's not necessarily in vivo it's
[03:46:45.840 --> 03:46:50.480]   like during a surgery doing imaging and stuff like that and it's like you know getting the same sorts
[03:46:50.480 --> 03:46:55.680]   of images that you get with the standard pathology workflow and doing that sort of conversion like
[03:46:55.680 --> 03:47:02.240]   you mentioned going down this cheap and easy approach that you can do um within the surgery
[03:47:02.240 --> 03:47:06.320]   to this more expensive knowledge that you could ever do within a surgery and i mean it's nice for
[03:47:06.320 --> 03:47:13.600]   me because i you know as you know was somewhat accidentally doing similar things to you but at
[03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:20.240]   the Salk Institute you know again kind of microscopy imagery construction stuff and yeah same thing like
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:30.000]   the folks that we worked with took that work and literally met a brain connectome you know
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:38.400]   as just like wow that's you know nobody's ever seen that before yeah so it's like that kind of
[03:47:38.400 --> 03:47:43.760]   aspect like yeah and take a step back and like damn no one has been able to do this before or
[03:47:43.760 --> 03:47:48.640]   like you know no one has seen this sort of thing before right then then especially when you hear
[03:47:48.640 --> 03:47:54.480]   that external input and feedback from people then you kind of realize it but you know on a day-to-day
[03:47:54.480 --> 03:48:00.000]   basis it's it's hard to kind of hit well it is because particularly on a day-to-day basis training
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:06.960]   deep learning models is extremely tedious and frustrating at least it is for me it's no it is
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:12.080]   frustrating and tedious and i and then also a lot of the work i do is like image like working with
[03:48:12.080 --> 03:48:16.800]   images and like you know you know so like this sort of approach that i take with the research and i
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:21.360]   think this is again an approach that dr lemonson has also like really pushed for is you know kind
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:26.000]   of focused on the data and like you know he always likes to say garbage in garbage out which is a
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:29.760]   common thing though you know there's a lot of focus on the data and making sure the data is the best
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:35.040]   quality and so a lot of my work also involves working with the data and just analyzing the data
[03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:39.360]   and you know cleaning up the data things like that and so that's a lot of tedious work in that aspect
[03:48:39.360 --> 03:48:45.680]   of things as well um so um yeah there's definitely a lot of tedious work that goes into it and
[03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:51.520]   sometimes you know sometimes it's not as maybe flashy as you know inventing a new method all
[03:48:51.520 --> 03:48:58.720]   together and things like that but it still has a you know um a useful impact and you know has a
[03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:06.240]   useful application at the end so yeah i think that definitely motivates me that you know you you do
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:12.400]   get something that you know could have a difference um and you know that doesn't necessarily need to
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:17.920]   be with flashy new architectures it can be with you know sometimes boring architectures um like
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:22.960]   the psychogand is actually a very old architecture but it works surprisingly well uh you know
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:27.600]   especially give it the right data um and so those are the sorts of things it's like you know giving
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:31.840]   it the right data what other picks can we use things like pre-training stuff like that yeah
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:36.880]   um sorry these i should not afford them you know um you know saying but and what's like um
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:46.240]   i kind of like you know curious thinking as a parent what what's what's kind of like you know
[03:49:46.240 --> 03:49:53.600]   your your parents particularly your mom you know we're heavily involved in teaching you stuff and
[03:49:55.680 --> 03:50:01.760]   your mom was there at a community college you know during the theology with you whatever um
[03:50:01.760 --> 03:50:08.560]   have you been like taking them along for the ride like do they know what psychogans are and stuff
[03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:15.280]   like that are they like or how much are they telling them about what's about you know your research
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:22.480]   yeah i i mean i i talked to them about it um so i mean they definitely have an idea i don't think
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:28.400]   they maybe fully understand the nitty gritty details um but you know sometimes they'll
[03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:33.440]   joke oh oh you talk about it but psychogans and um you know all the thought you know all the different
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:38.080]   words that i you know talking about my research and like for them they'll uh they'll be um you
[03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:42.720]   know sometimes joking about it but you know it's probably easier for them to appreciate your
[03:50:42.720 --> 03:50:48.960]   sister's work than your work i guess yeah that's definitely true uh that isn't good point yes no i
[03:50:48.960 --> 03:50:56.160]   think that is definitely uh very true um yeah that's that's yeah um but then like i mean i still like
[03:50:56.160 --> 03:51:01.120]   also practice sometimes my presentations with you know with my parents like like some of them will
[03:51:01.120 --> 03:51:07.520]   still practice like um yeah like i'm like i've done that since i was very young and i still do that of
[03:51:07.520 --> 03:51:15.040]   and um that so they certainly have an understanding of kind of the general ideas of my research
[03:51:15.040 --> 03:51:22.080]   but not of course of the nitty gritty details but um yeah i think they are also kind of amazed and
[03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:27.680]   you know i also they of course gave a lot of the sort of external feedback you know that they're
[03:51:27.680 --> 03:51:34.640]   also very amazed by what i'm doing and it's like yeah again it's like and do you kind of yeah it's
[03:51:34.640 --> 03:51:38.880]   like okay maybe maybe it is kind of interesting but like i feel like this is like normal and like
[03:51:38.880 --> 03:51:43.280]   and sometimes i'm also feel like i'm not doing enough right like i want to do more and i always
[03:51:43.280 --> 03:51:49.840]   want to do more but they're like you've done a lot already and it's like yeah sometimes it's nice then
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:54.720]   to hear that and then then kind of take that step back and kind of realize yeah and if you've been
[03:51:54.720 --> 03:52:01.440]   talking to them about like your have you been talking to them about like you know like joining
[03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:08.560]   stability and like you know i mean i talk to them about all these things like everything i'm
[03:52:08.560 --> 03:52:15.680]   involved in and they they're there to provide you know a lot of advice and feet and support and
[03:52:15.680 --> 03:52:19.760]   you know they help they help me out a lot in that sort of aspect so there's a lot of yeah it's very
[03:52:19.760 --> 03:52:26.480]   i'm lucky to have a lot of that family support and you know i try to rely on that um if you know as
[03:52:26.480 --> 03:52:32.800]   much as possible if i can um so yeah so they're very you know proud and excited of what i'm doing
[03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:39.600]   at stability as well um and you know they've been you know they've also yeah they yeah they're just
[03:52:39.600 --> 03:52:48.960]   also very excited as well so like are you kind of like almost at a at a new stage now like it feels
[03:52:48.960 --> 03:52:54.880]   like like from what i've heard you say both in interviews when you were younger and today and
[03:52:54.880 --> 03:53:02.720]   chatting to you like you had this long-running dream you know of like medical biological research
[03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:13.920]   get a phd and in March or whenever that that will be done does that feel like kind of like
[03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:20.240]   completing a certain stage of your life you know and like and like did you always have dreams about
[03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:24.320]   what happens after that or are you now kind of like moving into uncharted territory or
[03:53:24.320 --> 03:53:30.240]   how does that feel so so i don't know like you know i've definitely mentioned in the past that
[03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:37.680]   i want to um go to medical school right and then that was like something like that's something i'm
[03:53:37.680 --> 03:53:43.840]   still so the reason of course i'm one of the medical school is to make an impact with medical
[03:53:43.840 --> 03:53:48.240]   research and still in that avenue but i've been thinking you know i've kind of think about that
[03:53:48.240 --> 03:53:54.160]   and if that's something i want to still do and i think i've been kind of like talking to people
[03:53:54.160 --> 03:54:02.800]   about that now so like i mean i'm certainly going to take like a couple years off i think
[03:54:02.800 --> 03:54:06.800]   you know one or two years definitely like as it is a break but if i if i am going to go to medical
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:11.360]   school yeah you made a couple of years off study exactly yeah because then you get a medical school
[03:54:11.360 --> 03:54:15.760]   again another like um you know it's a lot of memorizing and more more studying and you know
[03:54:15.760 --> 03:54:22.080]   i've done that for i don't know for a very long time and also medical school is very specifically
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:26.240]   you know like in a lot of ways it is a trade school you know which is teaching the trade
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:35.120]   of being a doctor which is not really what you're trying to do yeah it's i mean i i guess the thing
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:43.120]   is i guess part of me believes that like that is really important skill to have if you want to
[03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:52.640]   kind of maybe understand you know what things need improvement and need change in in in the field and
[03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:57.040]   i think it's also like like the way i've always thought about it was like if you find a practicing
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:02.640]   doctor then i get to have more hands-on experiences with patients and understand better the sort of
[03:55:02.640 --> 03:55:07.120]   challenges that patients are facing um but then of course there's also that aspect like maybe you
[03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:10.880]   don't need to do that you can just talk to doctors and talk to patients and maybe that's not a
[03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:16.160]   requirement so i'm still trying to figure out maybe what is that yeah what is it almost reminds
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:22.960]   me of like me now being a homeschooling dad and trying to learn about teaching and i spend
[03:55:22.960 --> 03:55:27.520]   dozens and dozens and dozens of hours listening to interviews with teachers
[03:55:27.520 --> 03:55:34.160]   and like i hear them describing their challenges and frustrations and processes and whatever and
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:41.280]   yeah it's not the same as going to you know to school to learn to be a teacher and then practicing
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:47.520]   being a teacher but the difference you know in terms of like percentages like one percent of the
[03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:53.600]   works or 50 percent of the upside or something i don't know again i think the difference is you're
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:57.440]   still doing the teaching right you're doing the teaching with your daughter right that's true i
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:03.760]   am you're still having a hands-on experience and you have that experience to kind of learn from
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:08.880]   yeah and i guess i have more expertise in teaching my daughter than anybody else in the world
[03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:16.400]   exactly right and so well yeah like i was saying like yeah i think um i mean as you said that you
[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:21.840]   know you are of course the expert in in teaching your daughter and i think like to a certain extent
[03:56:21.840 --> 03:56:30.320]   you know doctors are the expert in you know creating their patients um i so i i think there
[03:56:30.320 --> 03:56:36.400]   is value potentially in in um going to medical school and becoming a doctor there may also be
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:41.520]   valuing going to medical school and not necessarily becoming a doctor but still that process of going
[03:56:41.520 --> 03:56:47.200]   to a medical school i've seen people who've done that and they they seem to uh you know make a huge
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:52.720]   impact i think recently i heard a talk by someone from stanford who did that sort of process and he
[03:56:52.720 --> 03:56:57.680]   was he's he's done um uh you know he went through medical school and then he went into industry and
[03:56:57.680 --> 03:57:02.720]   you know in the form of several startups um you know creating medical devices and getting into
[03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:08.480]   clinic and he's now a professor at stanford uh teaching those sorts of same principles
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:14.240]   but like you know he clearly got a lot of value also out in his that medical knowledge um so i
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:19.200]   think so yeah i guess you know it's something i'm trying to explore right now and figure out what
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:24.080]   is the best path um and then similarly it is also something i have to figure out what to do right
[03:57:24.080 --> 03:57:29.680]   after i you know finish my phd because uh the medical school stuff is you know a couple years
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:33.840]   down the line but the ph you know after phd is just six months down the line so i'm trying to
[03:57:33.840 --> 03:57:37.760]   figure that out right now too yeah so i had you know so what's the kind of like
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:44.560]   sorry what's the what's the north star or whatever that's what that's that's guiding you in these
[03:57:44.560 --> 03:57:52.880]   thoughts what does you know what where do you want to be in 10 years or 20 years or 40 years
[03:57:53.760 --> 03:58:00.480]   yeah um it's yeah it's not like it's certainly true like i think like you know it was that's
[03:58:00.480 --> 03:58:10.080]   something and kind of like i mean i i just want to be able to um to make an impact right so i think
[03:58:10.080 --> 03:58:19.600]   this part of it is like you know getting something to the clinic is kind of my goal and in life just
[03:58:19.600 --> 03:58:26.960]   having something that mom you know it's something that's helping people to not be sick is that
[03:58:26.960 --> 03:58:34.480]   exactly yeah so um i think there's many paths to that um so it's just like what may be the best
[03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:43.360]   path for for me uh personally um there's of course you know academia which has its advantages but also
[03:58:43.360 --> 03:58:48.880]   many disadvantages um there's of course industry again there's a lot of you know again this is a
[03:58:48.880 --> 03:58:54.640]   similar situation there's still disadvantages and advantages with industry so it's kind of weighing
[03:58:54.640 --> 03:59:00.320]   those up those yeah i mean i think if i could like add my perspective because in a sense
[03:59:00.320 --> 03:59:06.240]   my question is not quite fair because i feel like it's like asking somebody what their favorite
[03:59:06.240 --> 03:59:11.600]   color is you know we don't actually necessarily have a favorite color and when you're younger
[03:59:13.040 --> 03:59:18.240]   i think a lot of us do as kids have like what do you want to be when you grow up you know
[03:59:18.240 --> 03:59:27.920]   but actually at least for me i got to a point where i what i really want to do is capture
[03:59:27.920 --> 03:59:34.160]   opportunities as they come along and like you know from time you know from moment to moment be
[03:59:34.160 --> 03:59:42.960]   living my best life with an overarching thesis you know and my thesis is very much about like
[03:59:42.960 --> 03:59:52.640]   kind of accessibility and fairness and you know opportunities for everybody and lack of gatekeeping
[03:59:52.640 --> 03:59:57.360]   and then you know i think about like well what you know where are my skills and what can i do
[03:59:57.360 --> 04:00:04.000]   at the moment and you know so like yeah as i mentioned i don't you know don't feel like you
[04:00:04.000 --> 04:00:11.120]   have to yeah you don't have some 20 year plan opportunities that you have you want to catch
[04:00:11.120 --> 04:00:15.920]   right because like stability is kind of like one of those opportunities because yes exactly
[04:00:15.920 --> 04:00:22.320]   like and like i didn't know existed a year ago i didn't and it's kind of funny like a year ago
[04:00:22.320 --> 04:00:29.680]   so stability ai is a company which it's just raised about a hundred million dollars and it's
[04:00:29.680 --> 04:00:34.320]   basically doing exactly what you and i have been talking about with our research
[04:00:34.320 --> 04:00:43.040]   generative modeling so it's creating images sounds texts whatever that didn't previously exist
[04:00:43.040 --> 04:00:51.440]   or or or reconstructing those things in interesting ways using deep learning um yeah and
[04:00:52.400 --> 04:01:02.880]   the um ceo is an ex hedge fund guy named emad um who's you know in the papers and new york
[04:01:02.880 --> 04:01:10.400]   times podcast and whatever else and um yeah i mean so how did you find yourself with stability ai
[04:01:10.400 --> 04:01:17.840]   did you reach out to him did he reach out to you or yeah so like yeah again so yeah it's just to
[04:01:17.840 --> 04:01:24.160]   kind of say like how i knew about stability ai like i didn't know about stability ai like say
[04:01:24.160 --> 04:01:33.360]   a year ago i had seen a couple of things about it i think i think for example um uh at from crowson
[04:01:33.360 --> 04:01:39.120]   who's like one of the leading researchers in in this field of ai art and yeah she's amazing
[04:01:39.120 --> 04:01:45.520]   image generation and stuff like that i saw like she was like getting getting supported by stability
[04:01:45.520 --> 04:01:51.040]   ai and that was like the only thing i've seen about stability ai basically and like entire
[04:01:51.040 --> 04:01:57.120]   online presence at the time this is like january of 2021 uh 2022 so like yeah basically the
[04:01:57.120 --> 04:02:01.440]   beginning of this year and there was a part of that there's like no online presence of this company
[04:02:01.440 --> 04:02:10.960]   um but emad yeah emad was like in the um in the discord servers so um you know there's one of the
[04:02:10.960 --> 04:02:16.640]   discord servers which is eluther ai this is again one of these sorts of so this is a popular text
[04:02:16.640 --> 04:02:25.920]   chat system yeah so yeah this this this is kind of a um you know the discord server was mostly
[04:02:25.920 --> 04:02:33.040]   focused on you know the deep learning research um that eluther ai is known for some of their
[04:02:33.040 --> 04:02:39.280]   sorts of um they have generated like developed some of these sorts of um open source versions
[04:02:39.280 --> 04:02:45.680]   or kind of replications of models like gpt3 and things like that like these sorts of again
[04:02:45.680 --> 04:02:50.640]   generative models but this was more focused on text instead of images so they have done like
[04:02:50.640 --> 04:02:55.280]   actual solid research and i think some of the data sets that they've created data sets and i
[04:02:55.280 --> 04:02:59.520]   think these data sets are actually used by a lot of these industry labs and things like that even now
[04:02:59.520 --> 04:03:05.840]   um so i was you know i've been i've been hanging around in that server you know you know talking
[04:03:05.840 --> 04:03:12.960]   about research and other sorts of things um and so i think at this at this point um i was specifically
[04:03:12.960 --> 04:03:21.680]   looking for uh for gpu resources oh and actually um it's funny that i mentioned that because
[04:03:21.680 --> 04:03:26.960]   we never actually talked about um you know the sort of support that you know was given to
[04:03:26.960 --> 04:03:33.360]   what you weren't provided actually right um because originally a lot of my research was provided
[04:03:33.920 --> 04:03:40.400]   uh the support in terms of like compute resources and gpu resources and also some expertise was
[04:03:40.400 --> 04:03:48.560]   provided through this organization that jeremy leads bamri uh he was at he led this at uh uesf
[04:03:48.560 --> 04:03:55.280]   and so actually that was kind of when when we met um with uh dr leminson you know uh talking about
[04:03:55.280 --> 04:04:01.440]   research that was kind of the outcome of that meeting in terms of me working with bamri i have
[04:04:01.440 --> 04:04:07.120]   an idea about that by the way which i'll talk to you about after our interview perhaps yeah that
[04:04:07.120 --> 04:04:11.920]   would be great to talk about but anyway so you know i got a lot of support from there in terms
[04:04:11.920 --> 04:04:16.160]   of compute resources and gps because that's of course a you know a huge limiting factor in terms
[04:04:16.160 --> 04:04:21.840]   of ai research um but if you still yeah the computers are expensive yeah gps are expensive
[04:04:21.840 --> 04:04:26.640]   but even if you have like you know a few good gps you can still do a lot of great research i mean
[04:04:26.640 --> 04:04:31.360]   i'm not like using thousands of gps actually in my own research i'm just using a few gps there's
[04:04:31.360 --> 04:04:35.760]   still like high-end gps and so some people my final is like a very but it's still like nothing
[04:04:35.760 --> 04:04:40.240]   compared to like the thousands of gps used to create these huge models but i think um so yeah
[04:04:40.240 --> 04:04:45.120]   i got some of that support through bamri they were providing those resources and i also worked with
[04:04:45.120 --> 04:04:51.280]   some great people there uh andrew shaw who was again i think he's also the fast ci alumnus um
[04:04:51.280 --> 04:04:58.080]   and also uh uh daniel o'connor he was a professor at usf um and so i was working with them and you
[04:04:58.080 --> 04:05:03.760]   know that was that was a very great collaboration but then unfortunately um you know the bamri
[04:05:03.760 --> 04:05:10.320]   i guess erasement kind of had to shut down um so then i was then i had i was able to find another
[04:05:10.320 --> 04:05:17.120]   like a short-term grant for a few months and and then that lasted till january and so now i still
[04:05:17.120 --> 04:05:23.360]   need resources for compute to complete my research research so i kind of just like message in the chat
[04:05:23.360 --> 04:05:27.120]   like oh i'm running out of compute i don't know what i'm going to do and i was just like just kind
[04:05:27.120 --> 04:05:30.720]   of like a general message or something like that and then he just like you know replies
[04:05:30.720 --> 04:05:37.760]   he replies with like a single wave emoji and he was like and i'm like oh hello what what are you
[04:05:37.760 --> 04:05:41.840]   why are you waving is there something that you can help out with and it was like yeah we can provide
[04:05:41.840 --> 04:05:47.680]   gps and he was and then and so then we started dm'ing and he was talking about stability ai and
[04:05:47.680 --> 04:05:55.520]   what the goals were and he was um um you know he said that he can provide gps for for research and
[04:05:55.520 --> 04:06:00.960]   also he even offered to then support my own research and you know provide a fellowship and
[04:06:00.960 --> 04:06:05.360]   because he said like he was any he's that's something that a program that he was starting
[04:06:05.360 --> 04:06:13.840]   is you know providing these phd fellowships to uh to you know researchers in ai so um i was
[04:06:13.840 --> 04:06:20.000]   one of the first apple one of the first uh um for folks to receive that fellowship i think i was i
[04:06:20.000 --> 04:06:27.280]   think it was actually um and so he provided that to me as well and so this was you know back in like
[04:06:27.280 --> 04:06:33.520]   january february or so and so since then i've actually you know been kind of involved in like
[04:06:33.520 --> 04:06:37.760]   you know going knowing what's going on and like kind of helping out here and there not officially
[04:06:37.760 --> 04:06:43.120]   an employee but you know getting support now through the to the you know through the compute
[04:06:43.120 --> 04:06:48.880]   but then also through the um uh you know you know through the fellowship but of course the fellowship
[04:06:48.880 --> 04:06:55.520]   was specifically for my for my phd and you know those stuff um and so since then i've
[04:06:55.520 --> 04:06:59.440]   you know been involved and i knew like some things were happening and i was like oh this
[04:06:59.440 --> 04:07:04.640]   kind of cool like what's going on here and and you know the whole stable diffusion stuff started
[04:07:04.640 --> 04:07:09.040]   happening and picking up and this was like by then it was like july and august and it was like
[04:07:09.040 --> 04:07:13.760]   you know what i think i might want to join this company and help out and and actually be part of
[04:07:13.760 --> 04:07:19.840]   this um yeah so and yeah so that i'd join in in i think august september yeah it's definitely
[04:07:19.840 --> 04:07:25.280]   history being made in real time yeah yeah so it was very exciting because like yeah he's the kind
[04:07:25.280 --> 04:07:30.480]   of guy who's like like and you know he's very like um down to earth in terms of like you know
[04:07:30.480 --> 04:07:34.880]   it's not like he's like a you know uh you know you think like he's an ex hedge fund manager and
[04:07:34.880 --> 04:07:39.440]   he's like oh like you know he's the ceo this big company like kind of like nowadays it's like you
[04:07:39.440 --> 04:07:43.760]   know big company you know he's getting interviews by all these people you know you don't really like
[04:07:43.760 --> 04:07:48.640]   he's like still praying down to earth and like talks to him to everyone and you know he's
[04:07:48.640 --> 04:07:52.880]   interested he's very active in some of his discord servers and will talk to folks about stuff and
[04:07:52.880 --> 04:07:58.640]   like so you know that's how i first interacted with what server and then it's kind of kind of
[04:07:58.640 --> 04:08:03.120]   interesting to see everything kind of play out and you know my you know my involvement in that
[04:08:03.120 --> 04:08:09.440]   as well so it's it's very exciting and i'm very lucky to to have discovered this and be supported
[04:08:09.440 --> 04:08:18.080]   by him as well and by stability ai so yeah very um let me ask you something at a more meta level
[04:08:18.080 --> 04:08:26.080]   which is um you know it's it's interesting that you mentioned that you know as a very young
[04:08:27.440 --> 04:08:33.920]   child you know you had an iq test and you performed highly on that and you know so obviously this
[04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:40.480]   intelligence thing going on um but like interestingly from my point of view
[04:08:40.480 --> 04:08:49.920]   in working with you i wouldn't say the thing that most stands out is like wow he's way smarter than
[04:08:49.920 --> 04:09:00.160]   everybody but actually wow your i don't know if exactly work ethic's the right word but your
[04:09:00.160 --> 04:09:07.200]   your your way of working is better than most people i work with like you reliably tend to
[04:09:07.200 --> 04:09:11.760]   follow through on the things that you say you're going to do at more or less the time you say you're
[04:09:11.760 --> 04:09:19.760]   going to do them you generally speaking don't express opinions about things with which you're
[04:09:19.760 --> 04:09:24.480]   unfamiliar but and when there's a paper or whatever that comes out you actually read it before you
[04:09:24.480 --> 04:09:31.280]   start talking about like these are all things that sound normal and obvious but they're not at all
[04:09:31.280 --> 04:09:36.400]   you know like very few people actually read the papers and very few people actually do the things
[04:09:36.400 --> 04:09:41.920]   that they say they're going to do at about this time they say they're going to do them um and
[04:09:41.920 --> 04:09:47.840]   like i really um enjoy that about working with you because i feel like i can actually have
[04:09:48.320 --> 04:09:56.320]   you know sensible conversations that are fact-based and are going to have follow-up and
[04:09:56.320 --> 04:10:05.840]   yeah so it's kind of interesting to me that you're clearly a bit of an outlier on two axes that
[04:10:05.840 --> 04:10:17.680]   don't necessarily correlate you know which is something about kind of you know hard work and
[04:10:17.680 --> 04:10:27.200]   reliability and and not no bullshit you know as well as intellect so like where does that kind of
[04:10:29.840 --> 04:10:36.320]   you know getting things done and actually doing the reading and uh or you know the fact that you
[04:10:36.320 --> 04:10:42.800]   have this like paper reading group and you make sure it happens each week and you make sure that
[04:10:42.800 --> 04:10:50.800]   there's somebody to present and you like it it's again it's not rocket science but as somebody
[04:10:50.800 --> 04:10:55.520]   i'm normally the person who organizes things because nobody else does so it's nice for me
[04:10:55.520 --> 04:11:01.280]   to discover somebody else in the world who actually does things reliably as well yeah
[04:11:01.280 --> 04:11:06.400]   i don't know like where do you feel like this is coming from is this something you've worked hard
[04:11:06.400 --> 04:11:14.400]   to make happen or is this just natural to you or well first of all i've i personally personally
[04:11:14.400 --> 04:11:19.200]   i feel like i'm not like a hugely organized person so like it's kind of interesting to
[04:11:19.200 --> 04:11:26.080]   hear that to be honest i mean i'm not either but like it's just a case of like just doing
[04:11:26.080 --> 04:11:29.840]   the things you say you're going to do you don't have to be terribly looking like this you just
[04:11:29.840 --> 04:11:34.800]   totally flake out you know i think i don't know like
[04:11:34.800 --> 04:11:39.600]   the thing is like also i feel like sometimes like you know there's like
[04:11:39.600 --> 04:11:46.720]   like when you say what do you mean by like doing what you say you do because like i guess maybe
[04:11:46.720 --> 04:11:50.320]   yeah because like okay so for example you say okay we're going to have a paper club
[04:11:50.320 --> 04:11:56.160]   it's going to be each week this is the time it's going to be you know well that actually happens
[04:11:56.160 --> 04:12:03.840]   you know and and you you know or you say like i say like oh i want to interview you for a podcast
[04:12:03.840 --> 04:12:08.000]   and you're like okay what time is it going to be and you you are there at that time and you make
[04:12:08.000 --> 04:12:14.960]   sure i don't know like i mean i think i brought a couple times but it's like it's follow through
[04:12:14.960 --> 04:12:23.360]   and and definitely the papers thing it's like not many people read the papers really but somehow
[04:12:23.360 --> 04:12:27.120]   still have opinions because of like something they read on twitter or something and you tend
[04:12:27.120 --> 04:12:32.160]   to be like okay yeah i read the paper in this section i saw this thing um i don't know i think
[04:12:32.160 --> 04:12:41.520]   you're i think you're reliable and um and authentic and honest and because like oftentimes like um
[04:12:42.880 --> 04:12:47.920]   like a lot of projects like you know i i feel like like there's like i have a lot of projects
[04:12:47.920 --> 04:12:52.720]   right like there's so many projects and sometimes projects kind of you know slip slip my mind or
[04:12:52.720 --> 04:12:57.040]   you know just kind of you know sort of they just become less priority so like for that reason
[04:12:57.040 --> 04:13:02.240]   oftentimes i feel like maybe i'm kind of flaky in certain aspects but so that's what like when i
[04:13:02.240 --> 04:13:08.960]   wasn't when i was i haven't experienced that so maybe that's just okay i'm just revealing my
[04:13:08.960 --> 04:13:13.520]   my claws down well i mean no i mean instead of i just want to say it's not a flaw like it's like
[04:13:13.520 --> 04:13:19.280]   that's part of prioritization i think the key thing is the things that you it's not so much
[04:13:19.280 --> 04:13:23.360]   that you let them slip but you make a conscious decision to deprioritize them and that you clearly
[04:13:23.360 --> 04:13:28.560]   communicate that to the people involved that this is not something i can work on right now i haven't
[04:13:28.560 --> 04:13:34.240]   always been good at that myself but it's something i want to be good at yeah so yeah when you were
[04:13:34.240 --> 04:13:37.120]   having when you're talking about like flaking and stuff like that i thought maybe that's what you're
[04:13:37.120 --> 04:13:42.480]   talking about i was like no i'm not i'm very bad at that kind of stuff but in terms of like things
[04:13:42.480 --> 04:13:49.200]   like yeah paper reading groups and stuff like that i think part of it is like like i guess there's
[04:13:49.200 --> 04:13:56.880]   like some aspect of it that's more like um forcing myself to like have some accountability i guess or
[04:13:56.880 --> 04:14:01.360]   something like that whereas like how do you do that paper reading group there are people there
[04:14:01.360 --> 04:14:07.200]   you know i'm you know there's some expectation to have something for them so it was that i think
[04:14:07.200 --> 04:14:12.400]   there's kind of that sort of aspect of things so by publicly stating this is going to happen you're
[04:14:12.400 --> 04:14:17.920]   exact requiring yourself to follow through exactly i think that's kind of what happens
[04:14:17.920 --> 04:14:24.560]   i got another hypothesis that i think might be related which is i think well i mean clearly
[04:14:26.000 --> 04:14:33.600]   you're somebody who just genuinely loves learning um and i am as well you know i really very much am
[04:14:33.600 --> 04:14:40.640]   but i'm not sure like it's that common to love learning as much as we do you know like i
[04:14:40.640 --> 04:14:46.000]   there's almost nothing i i mean i would rather spend time with my daughter than anything else
[04:14:46.000 --> 04:14:53.280]   but other than that like that i just want to learn things and i guess when that gives you a lot of
[04:14:53.280 --> 04:15:03.360]   joy you put time into it um yes i think there's certainly some of that but in terms of like yeah
[04:15:03.360 --> 04:15:08.400]   i think a lot of i think a lot of it like in terms of the paper reading group yes i was like
[04:15:08.400 --> 04:15:12.880]   i know i was like yeah that was that's an example they're like well i think the thing was like
[04:15:12.880 --> 04:15:17.280]   especially i created like the paper reading group like some was like maybe you should have a diffusion
[04:15:17.280 --> 04:15:21.360]   model paper that's so yeah just to explain it's like again a paper reading group that i i am hosting
[04:15:21.360 --> 04:15:27.120]   like every week and it's about these sorts of uh image generation models you know they're called
[04:15:27.120 --> 04:15:32.480]   diffusion models it's like the the mean this is the new form whether or not those old-fashioned
[04:15:32.480 --> 04:15:38.240]   cycle games some people still talk about um so i had someone was saying yeah we should have this
[04:15:38.240 --> 04:15:43.440]   study group and i was like sure i'll do it um and the reason i decided to do it was because
[04:15:43.440 --> 04:15:50.960]   i felt like this is a good way to force me to actually read a lot of these papers and on
[04:15:50.960 --> 04:15:55.840]   otherwise it is tough to to read you know papers and you know when there's so many
[04:15:55.840 --> 04:16:00.320]   you know there's still much to do and there's just a lot a lot you know there's um you know
[04:16:00.320 --> 04:16:04.000]   and there's so many papers to read so i figured you know this is this is just a good opportunity
[04:16:04.000 --> 04:16:09.680]   to kind of force myself to to dig into the literature more um so i think part of it was
[04:16:09.680 --> 04:16:18.000]   just like yeah um just giving you know kind of you know making these situations where i'm forced to
[04:16:18.000 --> 04:16:24.240]   you know how this public accountability and get the get the work done and so like that's what like
[04:16:24.240 --> 04:16:28.800]   just generally in terms of like you know research and stuff like that too like i have
[04:16:28.800 --> 04:16:35.440]   often meetings with my professors uh with my advisor dr leminson you know i have like a meeting
[04:16:35.440 --> 04:16:41.440]   at least once a week sometimes twice or even three times a week um because you know then it's like
[04:16:41.440 --> 04:16:47.760]   some form of accountability like okay i have to have something to show to my to my advisor and so
[04:16:47.760 --> 04:16:53.040]   how so i'll you know be able to do some experiments and show that um so it's just really helpful and
[04:16:53.040 --> 04:16:59.040]   especially as i'm the kind of person that tends to uh procrastinate a lot actually and i don't
[04:16:59.040 --> 04:17:06.480]   think most people realize that um no it's actually you know i tend to i am uh you know you know it's
[04:17:06.480 --> 04:17:11.120]   so funny because like it's interesting you say that because like i feel the same way about myself
[04:17:11.120 --> 04:17:15.040]   and yet i'm somebody who like is on the other end of this almost this exact question which is
[04:17:15.040 --> 04:17:19.200]   people are like how do you get so much work done and i was thinking like that question people ask
[04:17:19.200 --> 04:17:24.880]   me too and i'm like like i've gotten this question asked many uh you know several times and i'm like
[04:17:24.880 --> 04:17:30.800]   i cannot honestly i'm surprised i'm able to do this as well like i probably shouldn't be asking
[04:17:30.800 --> 04:17:36.080]   you the question that i can never answer for myself it's like it's like i'm always telling
[04:17:36.080 --> 04:17:41.600]   people like how i don't like if i was if i were better at high management and stuff like that
[04:17:41.600 --> 04:17:47.280]   a couple would accomplish so much more so like so it's like so there's definitely that aspect of
[04:17:47.280 --> 04:17:52.240]   things so like you know also having the accountability definitely helps like at least it will get done
[04:17:52.240 --> 04:17:57.360]   i'm still gonna probably procrastinate a little bit so like even like a lot of these um you know
[04:17:57.360 --> 04:18:04.000]   this paper reading group i'm like preparing it like the night of tour and so like i'm so the
[04:18:04.000 --> 04:18:08.000]   thing is like yeah i'm meant to be presenting it tomorrow's paper reading group and i have not
[04:18:08.000 --> 04:18:14.880]   prepared anything at this point maybe we should give you some time to do so um helping it
[04:18:14.880 --> 04:18:24.320]   yeah but the thing is like i've noticed like i think i realized like okay so like i tend to
[04:18:24.320 --> 04:18:31.760]   like i i do realize i tend to have like a faster um comprehension in terms of like i can
[04:18:32.720 --> 04:18:39.040]   read some paper and like understand it fairly quickly um and i know a lot of people tend to
[04:18:39.040 --> 04:18:44.800]   struggle with that and like like a lot of things i can read i mean read it and i can uh you know
[04:18:44.800 --> 04:18:51.280]   understand it very quickly and so that's how like like even with my procrastination i'm somehow able
[04:18:51.280 --> 04:18:56.240]   to manage it's not it's not the best situation to be in to be honest like somehow able to you know
[04:18:56.240 --> 04:19:03.040]   i've managed because like i can still pick up like so i think if in terms of like um like overall
[04:19:03.040 --> 04:19:09.520]   so like i'd overall tell people like what i like what i tell is like i'm certainly like
[04:19:09.520 --> 04:19:14.720]   i i will admit that you know i'm kind of above average right is it some something that you know
[04:19:14.720 --> 04:19:19.040]   i will say i'm i'm not the kind of person who likes to brag about these sorts of things but
[04:19:19.040 --> 04:19:24.800]   i will admit like you know maybe i'm you know i'm somewhat above average um of course um and i think
[04:19:24.800 --> 04:19:30.240]   that what i'm the what the main one of course i think the main things that i'm i'm pretty good
[04:19:30.240 --> 04:19:35.840]   at would be things like memory in terms of like quickly memorizing stuff and comprehension so i
[04:19:35.840 --> 04:19:40.880]   think those two things really help in terms of this sort of quick learning and you know these
[04:19:40.880 --> 04:19:46.240]   sorts of stuff but then i'd also say like and before i move on from the topic of you know being
[04:19:46.240 --> 04:19:51.120]   above average or whatever i think a lot of what i've been able to do is of course prove hard work
[04:19:51.120 --> 04:19:55.680]   and i think this goes back to your point about work ethic and stuff like this um you know the
[04:19:55.680 --> 04:20:01.600]   only way i've reached this level is mostly through uh hard work i i don't i don't think this would be
[04:20:01.600 --> 04:20:08.400]   possible if i was just you know if i didn't put any hard work into it it's like a combination of
[04:20:08.400 --> 04:20:13.360]   either definitely having some of those talents but then also putting in a lot of hard work and a lot
[04:20:13.360 --> 04:20:18.480]   of you know swearing and the sweat and blood and tears into this and you know you know you know
[04:20:18.480 --> 04:20:24.080]   working at it for for you know a long long time and so that's definitely that sort of work ethic
[04:20:24.080 --> 04:20:34.960]   is definitely something i mean the tinesity seems critical you know andrea yeah i yeah i think so i
[04:20:34.960 --> 04:20:41.600]   think um yeah so i i think also that's something i've you know definitely learned from you know
[04:20:41.600 --> 04:20:48.080]   my parents and i think they've kind of brought me up in that sort of you know those sorts of values
[04:20:48.080 --> 04:20:52.160]   in terms of hard work and like you know never taking these sorts of things you know these sorts
[04:20:52.160 --> 04:20:58.880]   of talents for granted and you know putting in the hard work that is necessary um so that's everything
[04:20:58.880 --> 04:21:03.120]   like people like oh you must be so you're still smart and everything must come easy to you um
[04:21:03.120 --> 04:21:07.280]   there's certainly some aspect that you know there's some comprehensive stuff that does come easy but
[04:21:07.280 --> 04:21:11.760]   a lot of it is still hard work that i have to still put effort into so it's not like everything
[04:21:11.760 --> 04:21:16.720]   comes easy to me um just you know you know automatically there's still some aspect that
[04:21:16.720 --> 04:21:21.440]   you know there's a lot of work that goes into it um yeah that's like something like that's
[04:21:21.440 --> 04:21:26.400]   sometimes kind of you know irritates me oh you're you know everything must be so easy for you and
[04:21:26.400 --> 04:21:32.560]   it's like no it's not it's like yeah exactly yeah you know in certain aspects i'm still you know
[04:21:32.560 --> 04:21:37.120]   like there's still like work you have to do it's like it's not like you can avoid doing
[04:21:37.120 --> 04:21:43.440]   this stuff you just can't avoid right you have to like put in the effort to to finish your homework
[04:21:43.440 --> 04:21:50.480]   problems to to um you know write your essays to you know whatever projects you're working on you
[04:21:50.480 --> 04:21:56.640]   still have to put in the effort on and so i know that's that's something that i and like even
[04:21:56.640 --> 04:22:01.680]   although like okay for you you're saying you you seem to pick it up a bit faster than other people
[04:22:01.680 --> 04:22:06.480]   but you're still starting with something that you didn't previously know and that at first you
[04:22:06.480 --> 04:22:11.120]   don't understand and then you have to struggle through and develop that understanding and then
[04:22:11.120 --> 04:22:17.280]   practice and exactly yeah i mean i say like even picking it up quickly i mean that's just to say
[04:22:17.280 --> 04:22:22.560]   like i can pick up you know you know the first like let's say if your best comprehension of the
[04:22:22.560 --> 04:22:28.000]   material is 100 you know you can pick up maybe the first you know 70 i can pick that up pretty
[04:22:28.000 --> 04:22:32.960]   quickly but then you don't even get that remaining 30 and you still have to put in put in the work
[04:22:32.960 --> 04:22:38.720]   right so it's more of like you know i definitely am able to get a very kind of a general gist and
[04:22:38.720 --> 04:22:43.440]   grasp of what's going on in a particular field or a particular paper or whatever but obviously if you
[04:22:43.440 --> 04:22:48.800]   want to you know truly understand it you do have to put in more work so like you know especially
[04:22:48.800 --> 04:22:53.760]   with this field of like diffusion models and stuff you know um you know i've been that even
[04:22:53.760 --> 04:22:58.320]   some of the original papers i still will go back and read like i mean i understand the general gist
[04:22:58.320 --> 04:23:03.120]   but there's still certain aspects that you want to like really you know to fully understand that
[04:23:03.120 --> 04:23:06.880]   those papers have to fully understand that field you know there's still certain parts that i still
[04:23:06.880 --> 04:23:12.160]   am studying um and then of course there's other aspects of it in terms of putting it into practice
[04:23:12.160 --> 04:23:16.720]   like you know in the case of these models and these sorts of deep and deep learning in general
[04:23:16.720 --> 04:23:21.200]   you have to code it up and you have to actually experiment and try it out and so you know there's
[04:23:21.200 --> 04:23:26.000]   also that aspect of things that also helps solidify your knowledge and there's really
[04:23:26.000 --> 04:23:31.360]   no way around that instead of except you have to do that so there's no way around those sorts of
[04:23:31.360 --> 04:23:36.160]   things and you know that provides you know this sort of different knowledge that you can't get
[04:23:36.160 --> 04:23:41.840]   anywhere else you have to do yeah yeah it is it is it's hard work and it um it's difficult
[04:23:41.840 --> 04:23:47.280]   and like i feel like that's the biggest difference i see between people i know that are extremely
[04:23:47.280 --> 04:23:54.880]   effective and those who are less effective is the people who keep doing it like for me personally i
[04:23:54.880 --> 04:24:01.440]   actually don't find i pick things up faster than most people but i seem to stick with things longer
[04:24:01.440 --> 04:24:07.120]   than most people and i also seem to be more like prepared to keep digging and digging you know
[04:24:07.120 --> 04:24:15.440]   it's like yesterday when we were chatting in our little study group and i asked about a paper that
[04:24:15.440 --> 04:24:21.200]   actually is extremely basic and i was like i don't think i fully understand this yet and i probably
[04:24:21.200 --> 04:24:26.960]   ought to and yeah just really took the time to get at it dig through it which in some ways it
[04:24:26.960 --> 04:24:32.640]   requires putting aside the embarrassment of saying like i don't fully understand this fairly basic
[04:24:32.640 --> 04:24:40.080]   paper yeah yeah but now i feel like i probably understand it better than a lot of people do
[04:24:40.080 --> 04:24:46.880]   having taken that time with you guys to dig into it carefully and going back into like yeah
[04:24:46.880 --> 04:24:54.960]   like understanding stuff like obviously um teach of course teaching this material really like like i
[04:24:54.960 --> 04:24:58.800]   guess this is like the was the Feynman Feynman technique right the Feynman technique is not
[04:24:58.800 --> 04:25:05.440]   you know try to teach it to other people and make and that also really helps um so like especially
[04:25:05.440 --> 04:25:10.560]   with this sort of diffusion model stuff like you know i've just been practicing in so many different
[04:25:10.560 --> 04:25:14.800]   ways right just through that in the term of teaching this material through the study group
[04:25:14.800 --> 04:25:18.800]   through like the study group that i host and then of course you know the sort of study groups that
[04:25:18.800 --> 04:25:24.480]   we have together um and then yeah well as we were saying yesterday when when we were chatting in our
[04:25:24.480 --> 04:25:29.520]   group it's like we're learning ourselves diffusion modeling through diffusion processes of like
[04:25:29.520 --> 04:25:34.080]   doing it again and again in a thousand different ways until eventually yeah makes it way into our
[04:25:34.080 --> 04:25:40.160]   brain yeah and so you know i have that you know that study group these two study groups then you
[04:25:40.160 --> 04:25:46.320]   know um you know this sort of uh you know writing it out in code and teaching try to teach it in a
[04:25:46.320 --> 04:25:51.120]   different way not just like from the paper but from the code and then like also like like i recently
[04:25:51.120 --> 04:25:54.880]   had this twitter thread and it's like you know that's a that was a different experience it's
[04:25:54.880 --> 04:26:00.080]   like how do i teach it in a you know we're in in those limitations of twitter it's like an
[04:26:00.080 --> 04:26:04.960]   entirely different uh kind of a thought process so and then i know i've just kind of written down
[04:26:04.960 --> 04:26:10.160]   you know in just different ways of explaining the same concept you know because i i kind of actually
[04:26:10.160 --> 04:26:15.120]   really want to you know you know understand diffusion models and kind of be actually an
[04:26:15.120 --> 04:26:20.720]   expert in that field to be honest so i just been trying to like really dive deep in that for you
[04:26:20.720 --> 04:26:24.160]   know i've been doing that for several months now and through all of these different you know
[04:26:24.160 --> 04:26:31.520]   platforms so i i think like and so like overall teaching it's something that actually in general
[04:26:31.520 --> 04:26:39.360]   i'm kind of passionate about um and it's but it's something like i don't know like again how good i
[04:26:39.360 --> 04:26:44.560]   am at it it's something that i'm i feel like i'm still trying to you know get better at especially
[04:26:44.560 --> 04:26:49.840]   i think we you know we've talked about this before it's like something that you know i you know myself
[04:26:49.840 --> 04:26:54.960]   i'm a person kind of like you know being at the plant person who grasps things fairly quickly or
[04:26:54.960 --> 04:27:00.400]   again as i talked about grasp you know the first 70 80 fairly quickly and you can get to that level
[04:27:00.400 --> 04:27:07.040]   quickly compared to other people um it's harder for me to like figure out like what exactly are the
[04:27:07.040 --> 04:27:11.760]   the the weak points or the sort of you know that makes teaching more difficult for you than other
[04:27:11.760 --> 04:27:19.040]   people right so um so that that's something that you know can be tough but um again i try to get a
[04:27:19.040 --> 04:27:23.680]   lot of external feedback when when talking about these sort of things to figure that out um but
[04:27:23.680 --> 04:27:27.760]   that's something but like i really enjoy teaching and you know that's another thing like that's
[04:27:27.760 --> 04:27:31.760]   another thing like going back to i keep changing topics here but like going back to like you know
[04:27:31.760 --> 04:27:37.120]   the you know careers and things like academia and stuff like that right like academia is another
[04:27:37.120 --> 04:27:42.800]   great opportunity to like you know it's a it's it is a good opportunity to teach and also i mean
[04:27:42.800 --> 04:27:48.720]   it should be ideal right it's like it's teaching and doing research but sadly the structure of
[04:27:48.720 --> 04:27:55.680]   academia is a bit of a nightmare yeah it it turns out like um activity is weird because like
[04:27:55.680 --> 04:28:01.680]   it's teaching and research but the environment doesn't or like the sort of problem you know
[04:28:01.680 --> 04:28:06.000]   bureaucratic processes or administration does not or like whatever it is it does not select for the
[04:28:06.000 --> 04:28:14.480]   best teachers and researchers right it's it's it mostly selects for like the best researchers
[04:28:14.480 --> 04:28:18.080]   then of course those are like the when you say best features there's still like the researchers
[04:28:18.080 --> 04:28:21.600]   would get the most grants or whatever they still link you know there's still probably lots of great
[04:28:21.600 --> 04:28:26.720]   researchers work you know to get those opportunities and stuff anyway that's kind of a whole diversion
[04:28:26.720 --> 04:28:31.360]   but like in terms of like even academia i've had very bad professors but then they're like
[04:28:31.360 --> 04:28:36.320]   amazing researchers in terms of like they've got a lot of grants and they've got a lot of papers
[04:28:36.320 --> 04:28:40.800]   and stuff and that's the reason they they they're stuck they they stick around at these universities
[04:28:40.800 --> 04:28:45.280]   and they get high you know high pay from these universities it's because um they're good you
[04:28:45.280 --> 04:28:51.120]   know they have good research labs but they are terrible at teaching um but unfortunately
[04:28:51.120 --> 04:28:56.000]   and unfortunately some of them just don't care about improving their quality of teaching um but
[04:28:56.000 --> 04:29:01.200]   i think that even in academia you do have at least like for someone who's interested in both
[04:29:01.200 --> 04:29:05.920]   teaching and research it does seem like a like a good place to be in and yeah so that's why like
[04:29:05.920 --> 04:29:10.640]   even even though i do know a lot of the disadvantages of academia i think there's also still
[04:29:10.640 --> 04:29:16.160]   some advantages for the source of things that i'm interested in you know that being teaching and
[04:29:16.160 --> 04:29:20.320]   research so that's why i'm still you know highly considering that as a potential
[04:29:20.320 --> 04:29:27.520]   pathway but yeah i'm just overall like also really excited about teaching and educational content um
[04:29:27.520 --> 04:29:33.520]   and i'm hoping i'm doing i'm doing yeah i hope it's going well and if people are getting i mean
[04:29:33.520 --> 04:29:42.000]   teaching is itself a whole you know research field yeah that one can study and yeah there's a lot of
[04:29:42.000 --> 04:29:49.520]   valuable research and how people learn and what teaching works well and yeah it's a really
[04:29:49.520 --> 04:29:54.240]   interesting field and i've mainly been studying it when really well well mainly been studying it
[04:29:54.240 --> 04:30:00.800]   for teaching my daughter but i studied a little bit before that the fastai courses but not right
[04:30:00.800 --> 04:30:06.400]   nearly as much as i do now yeah i mean i i definitely think the fastai approach of like
[04:30:06.400 --> 04:30:11.360]   this sort of top down something i can't hear you oh no you're back oh sorry did something
[04:30:11.360 --> 04:30:16.800]   has to be at all yeah just your top just have disappeared for five seconds okay anyway i was
[04:30:16.800 --> 04:30:21.440]   just saying um yeah i was saying that like i think i definitely think like the fastai approach of
[04:30:21.440 --> 04:30:27.200]   this top down and followed by the bottom up is really like a very yeah i don't know it's
[04:30:27.200 --> 04:30:35.920]   it's a very good approach i think and i i like it sorry i like it yeah um and i i i think like any
[04:30:35.920 --> 04:30:41.840]   sort of like material that i mean yeah it it's just like yeah it's definitely a hard thing to do
[04:30:41.840 --> 04:30:47.440]   like as a teacher right it's like hard to prepare that sort of material very hard as a teacher you
[04:30:47.440 --> 04:30:51.440]   kind of think about it from like you want to start from the foundations and work your way up and it's
[04:30:51.440 --> 04:30:59.840]   kind of hard to you know like change that kind of also we haven't seen many role models of teaching
[04:30:59.840 --> 04:31:07.280]   technical content top down so we haven't experienced what that looks like very often yeah yeah so
[04:31:07.280 --> 04:31:13.760]   it's you know and and but yeah i mean it definitely does say something that like someone like me who
[04:31:13.760 --> 04:31:20.800]   generally does start from the sort of bottom up approach and you know does fairly well with that
[04:31:20.800 --> 04:31:26.080]   bottom up approach and even then i'm getting a lot out of the sort of top down approach that's cool
[04:31:26.080 --> 04:31:31.840]   so i think i think it's also like it's not you know i mean yeah and i know a lot of yeah a lot
[04:31:31.840 --> 04:31:37.360]   of people you know struggle with the bottom up approach and that's why i do it yeah even as
[04:31:37.360 --> 04:31:41.680]   someone who does well with the the bottom up approach i think even then the top down approach
[04:31:41.680 --> 04:31:48.080]   is is very helpful often oh that's really cool oh that that's yeah i don't know where i was going
[04:31:48.080 --> 04:31:54.160]   with this to be honest yeah that's fine i'm very interested in your thoughts um yeah all right i
[04:31:54.160 --> 04:32:03.200]   think we should consider wrapping things up um depending on like um whether there's things either
[04:32:03.200 --> 04:32:11.360]   life things or work things or thoughts you have that we haven't covered and you'd be interested in
[04:32:12.400 --> 04:32:24.720]   chatting about that thing comes to mind i guess um yeah i mean i don't know like yeah whether
[04:32:24.720 --> 04:32:30.560]   on stage or i guess did it i just wrote maybe there were other really misconceptions about
[04:32:30.560 --> 04:32:36.320]   foul prodigies oh i would love to hear about that if the yeah well i know i know we discussed this
[04:32:36.320 --> 04:32:41.840]   before in terms of like um you know we this is again kind of random like we discussed it before
[04:32:41.840 --> 04:32:47.600]   but like child prodigies they tend to be i mean of course even this interview we talked a little bit
[04:32:47.600 --> 04:32:51.760]   about like you know child priorities tend to be you know sort of considered socially outcast things
[04:32:51.760 --> 04:32:56.080]   like that and we talked about that but then also like you know things like you know they tend to be
[04:32:56.080 --> 04:33:04.800]   considered oh maybe they're autistic and those sorts of um aspects of things um and i mean i just
[04:33:04.800 --> 04:33:10.240]   i just kind of like i mean i tell this to people like even in other interviews and in other places
[04:33:10.240 --> 04:33:17.440]   and when people ask me it's like yeah i think i'm fairly normal right like i think you're fairly
[04:33:17.440 --> 04:33:24.400]   normal yeah whatever it's said yeah um um and i mean we've had literally that with our daughter
[04:33:24.400 --> 04:33:30.240]   sometimes yeah not that often not that unusually people literally ask like oh does she have some
[04:33:30.240 --> 04:33:34.160]   sort of like i'm like oh she's quite advanced at school oh does she have social problems
[04:33:34.160 --> 04:33:39.760]   yeah like no and they don't even like they don't even almost seem to believe me they keep talking
[04:33:39.760 --> 04:33:47.600]   as if she asked just because she's doing well at school i mean there's there's like i think some
[04:33:47.600 --> 04:33:55.200]   you know um research into like you know yeah the sort of um coincidence like yeah the sort of thing
[04:33:55.200 --> 04:34:02.320]   where like you know both you know people who are smart and you know they tend to have autism and
[04:34:02.320 --> 04:34:10.480]   these sorts of yeah true is the term that tends to get used uh twice exceptional oh okay yeah um
[04:34:10.480 --> 04:34:16.960]   and so there's that so then i think yeah there's there is some correlation but yeah it's nowhere
[04:34:16.960 --> 04:34:23.040]   near 100 you know yeah exactly um if i remember correctly at one point like someone was like
[04:34:23.040 --> 04:34:28.240]   i think there's like some research and they're like um so where was i oh yeah i was saying like
[04:34:28.240 --> 04:34:31.920]   i think at one point like there were some folks who were interested and i think researchers
[04:34:31.920 --> 04:34:36.480]   in talking to us and things like that and studying us but then they were like then they heard we're
[04:34:36.480 --> 04:34:40.160]   not autistic or something like this and they're like oh we're not interested anymore we're
[04:34:40.160 --> 04:34:47.840]   interested more studying the you know the autistic part of things and um so um yeah i mean there's
[04:34:47.840 --> 04:34:54.720]   just generally this sort of like i think um just overall sort of stereotypes about about topologies
[04:34:54.720 --> 04:35:05.040]   and you know hopefully uh i'm you know as i've lived my life i think i kind of had um went against
[04:35:05.040 --> 04:35:11.600]   those stereotypes and yeah well in stereotypes are a lazy cognitive shortcut you know so it's
[04:35:11.600 --> 04:35:16.880]   very tempting and easy for people to put people into a bucket and then assign a whole bunch of
[04:35:16.880 --> 04:35:24.320]   things to them based on assumed group characteristics but yeah that prejudice is never
[04:35:24.320 --> 04:35:35.040]   good because no groups of humans are you know so identical hopefully these sorts of experiences
[04:35:35.040 --> 04:35:41.600]   that people see and and hopefully uh i mean yes as you said like yeah people are very complex and
[04:35:41.600 --> 04:35:48.000]   diverse and it's not this you know the stereotypes are not always applicable um and so yeah i think
[04:35:48.000 --> 04:35:53.440]   people should be more open to that uh-huh yeah and then just generally i think i was just going to
[04:35:53.440 --> 04:36:00.960]   make some general points of like yeah obviously um hard like like we mentioned this before you
[04:36:00.960 --> 04:36:08.080]   know hard work is always important um and then of course at least i'm the kind of person who
[04:36:08.080 --> 04:36:11.920]   who's very goal oriented i don't know if that works for everyone but for me it's always i've
[04:36:11.920 --> 04:36:17.920]   always thought it's useful to have a goal in mind and you know work towards that goal um at least
[04:36:17.920 --> 04:36:22.800]   that's how it's worth me and honestly i recommend people to at least explore that as a as something
[04:36:22.800 --> 04:36:34.080]   to try out um um and then yeah um and yeah i mean of course i of course i'm very lucky of course to
[04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:43.680]   have this a very supportive family um and i guess if there's any any parents or any folks like that
[04:36:43.680 --> 04:36:50.320]   who are listening i just would recommend to you know keep keep you know try you know whatever you
[04:36:50.320 --> 04:36:55.200]   can do to you know of course support your your children and because you never know what what
[04:36:55.200 --> 04:37:01.440]   could come out of it um and and more specifically i think like i would say support your children
[04:37:02.080 --> 04:37:06.320]   in terms of what they're telling you they want rather than what you think they ought to want
[04:37:06.320 --> 04:37:13.200]   yeah i was gonna say like don't push them in in terms of like yeah like i was never pushed which
[04:37:13.200 --> 04:37:18.160]   is which is a good thing honestly it's i forgot to mention is like there are many times in my
[04:37:18.160 --> 04:37:22.560]   parents like maybe you're pushing yourself too much and it's like honestly there's also that
[04:37:22.560 --> 04:37:29.600]   aspect of things like also you know there's also needs to be sometimes trying to have those breaks
[04:37:29.600 --> 04:37:35.200]   i guess um which is like which you know in this case my my my parents are the ones who kind of
[04:37:35.200 --> 04:37:41.920]   provide that i think um they they if any yeah they never have really pushed me and everything they
[04:37:41.920 --> 04:37:50.720]   were like if anything they they want me to slow down a bit i think um so i think um yeah you don't
[04:37:50.720 --> 04:37:55.600]   want to push your in yeah children yeah never really should be pushed but they should be
[04:37:55.600 --> 04:38:00.880]   supported in what they're interested in and what they're passionate about and of course like what
[04:38:00.880 --> 04:38:06.400]   you're passionate about interested can change over time but you know you just kind of whatever it is
[04:38:06.400 --> 04:38:14.080]   it's worth supporting it um and so luckily you know i've i've had all of that thanks to my parents
[04:38:14.080 --> 04:38:20.160]   and my family um you know so i mean yeah not just my parents of course even my sister you know is
[04:38:20.160 --> 04:38:26.160]   supportive you know comes comes along to to to all these classes and weights there and things like
[04:38:26.160 --> 04:38:30.000]   that and you know even i'm i try to be supportive with her go to all of her performances and things
[04:38:30.000 --> 04:38:36.000]   like that so you know that's also good that we're lucky to have that sort of family unit that's very
[04:38:36.000 --> 04:38:43.920]   supportive of each other yeah so um yeah so yeah that's mainly it and of course if you're interested
[04:38:43.920 --> 04:38:49.280]   in following me you like follow me on twitter and stuff you know i'm you know i'm mostly on twitter
[04:38:49.280 --> 04:38:55.280]   and you know we'll see i plan to i'm interested in maybe expanding from just twitter you know for
[04:38:55.280 --> 04:39:01.440]   for various reasons i bet but but i mean i really love twitter as a part of her in general um yeah
[04:39:01.440 --> 04:39:06.800]   and i've met a lot of amazing people there so i want to take on you know stick to twitter as
[04:39:06.800 --> 04:39:12.320]   much as possible but also i think some diversification is still also good in general right like you know
[04:39:12.320 --> 04:39:16.000]   they say that about like finance and they said about a lot of things you know being able to
[04:39:16.000 --> 04:39:20.560]   apply it and so i think that's probably also true in terms of my my social media and my
[04:39:20.560 --> 04:39:28.080]   personal brand probably yeah well tanish this has been an absolute pleasure and absolutely
[04:39:28.080 --> 04:39:37.440]   fascinating and i feel very very privileged to have you as our first guest on this podcast
