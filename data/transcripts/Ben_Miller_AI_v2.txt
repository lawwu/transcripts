[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.680]   In this special episode, I have with me Ben Miller, co-founder and CEO of Fundrise.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   And we're going to talk about venture capital and what's up with the innovation fund.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.480]   Welcome to the show, Ben.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.600]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.520]   So last time we spoke, you were all bulled up on real estate, which was a little bit
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.040]   different from where it was a year ago, two years ago.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.640]   So what about venture capital?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.600]   What's the latest happening in AI, innovation fund, and what are you all up to?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.320]   So private tech investing is so different than real estate investing.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.800]   Real estate is largely macro-driven, but technology, it's transformative, at least great technology
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   companies.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.760]   So you can invest into a company that could change the world and we could be in a depression.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.160]   And so it's much more about getting into those great companies than it is like the sort of,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.920]   I mean, obviously macro matters because tech multiples in 2021 were crazy.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.620]   So I'm not saying that it's only the companies that matter, but it's a very different dynamic.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.240]   And so we were lucky.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.360]   We had two things happen to us in 2023, basically the tech fund launched and we came into the
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.720]   market near the bottom of venture.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.440]   Venture basically, I think, bottomed in '23.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.280]   The second thing we did was we ended up getting into among the best private tech companies
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   in the world.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.520]   Can you name some of them?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.920]   Yeah, I can name them and we can talk about it.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   When I launched this tech fund, I had some naysayers.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.960]   One in the venture industry in particular said, "Well, you can't get into the great
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   companies."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.040]   And that we did, which is really, really gratifying.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.920]   And so let me break them up into categories and we can talk about the specific companies.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   So basically the big thing happening in the world right now is AI.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.680]   And so we pursued AI investing in sort of three ways.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.180]   We invested into the AI companies directly.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.480]   And those are like the big large language models, about 15% of the portfolios in the
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.240]   top AI companies.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.040]   We then invested in the data infrastructure companies.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.500]   And data infrastructure, if you're not a tech person, one way to think about that is that
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.760]   in a gold rush, you can invest in the gold mine, or you can invest in selling picks and
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.200]   shovels to the gold miners.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.040]   So data infrastructure is the picks and shovels strategy.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.720]   So everybody who is working on AI, one way or the other, needs data infrastructure because
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   data is the lifeblood of AI.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   And about half the portfolio is in data infrastructure.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   So the majority of it is in a picks and shovels kind of strategy, which is more consistent
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.880]   with my view about investing.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.620]   And then the third category are the vertical SaaS or the applications.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.800]   And we invested in a bunch of really good applications that are dominant players in
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.660]   each of their categories, but I think are amplified.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.720]   And then we had a little bit of other things, but that's like probably 90, 95% of the portfolio.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   So what percentage would you say the portfolio is exposed to AI?
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.040]   I mean, I really have to look at it specifically, but I'm going to say not over 90%.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.640]   I mean, it must be close to 100%.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   I mean, basically, we can work backwards from the vertical SaaS companies for a second.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   But if you take a vertical SaaS company like Canva, so we invested in Canva.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.200]   Canva is democratizing design.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.680]   And this is actually what technology does.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.000]   It takes something that was really expensive or only available to a few people and then
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   makes it available to everybody.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.320]   And that's what E-Trade did with trading, right?
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.520]   There's so many examples.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.720]   So Canva is the dominant, absolutely dominant player in that space.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   I don't even think it's close.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.240]   Just to put some numbers on it for you, like Adobe has a quarter trillion dollar valuation.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.560]   I think it's $250 billion last time I checked.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.160]   And Canva, if you go on Google Trends, Canva has just absolutely surpassed them on Google
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Trends.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.560]   And I think Canva's valuation last time I checked was like $25 billion or 10 times less.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.480]   And if you think about AI, if you go in, or you and I go in, we're going to do some designs
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:40.640]   for this podcast, AI's ability to edit this podcast, produce transcript, produce notes,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.120]   produce designs for it, help us distribute it, I mean, that's all part of what AI is
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   going to do and doing.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.320]   And Canva is going to be, I think, the dominant design solution for the next generation.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   Yeah, I was kind of skeptical of AI a year ago, and I was like, "Oh, it's like plagiarism
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.800]   and copying stuff and doing all that."
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.600]   But now that I've used some of the tools to do some editing for grammar, clarity, idea
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   generation, it's really increased my productivity.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.240]   So I guess the question that I have for our children, because my kids are four and six,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.160]   six and a half, is will AI be so revolutionary that it's going to take away millions of jobs
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.880]   and leave our children underemployed or unemployed, making college and grade school education
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.760]   kind of not very valuable?
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.680]   Or is it not going to be that revolutionary for those who are able to use AI and therefore
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.960]   be able to be more productive, make more money, and be more free in their lives and their
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   careers?
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   What's the take 10, 20 years in the future on how AI will impact our children's lives?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   Oh, man.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.040]   I feel like I can just repeat with the smartest people out there, I feel like it's a progression
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.700]   from the latter thing you said to the former.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.800]   So I am a believer of the Raker as well, the singularity or the way that the chief science
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.680]   officer at OpenAI talks about, Ilya, is that the neural network, it does replicate a lot
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.200]   of the way the brain works, and it's really like, it is a scaling challenge, mostly.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.280]   Like if we can scale the compute and the algorithms and things like that, I think we will see
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.680]   like a surprising amount of progress.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   And that's what, I mean, everybody's seeing AI go up the hockey stick rapidly.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.120]   But then the nature of technology is that the last 20% ends up taking 80% of the time.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.480]   And so we're going to see rapid progress, and essentially when does it slow, when does
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.000]   it sort of like the linear scaling benefits run out?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.720]   Like not anytime soon.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   And I think the actual challenge is not so much the technical capacity of, we're calling
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.200]   AI, whatever you want to call it, GPT.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.960]   It's actually the application, changing human behavior, like look at Zoom.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.000]   The second the pandemic happened, overnight, everybody changed their behavior and video
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.740]   became part of how we interact in work and life, and it wasn't true before.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.520]   So human behavior is actually the limiting factor, changing human behavior.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.120]   My parents shopped at department stores, and my kids don't know what a department store
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   is.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.060]   I don't think it's actually going to be the application and the political and human dynamics
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.240]   and the technology is just going to keep making pretty awesome progress, and it's just going
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.600]   to end up being different than what we think.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.040]   It's not going to be a human being.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.680]   We're going to have some complimentary, it's going to be really good at precise computation
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   and recall, which we're not so good at, right?
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.080]   But exactly where we're better and where they're, I mean the computer came along, changed how
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.800]   we do work, made us more productive, didn't obviate the need for jobs, just created a
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   different kind of job.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.680]   Yeah, I just remember being in school, there was like the HP 12C calculator, the scientific
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.200]   calculator, and those who knew how to use it were like math geniuses, and then those
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.160]   who didn't know how to use it like myself were just duds, and I remember quitting math
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.500]   after sophomore year in high school.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.160]   So it feels like the lesson is you better get on board with AI and you better learn
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.840]   how to use it for your job, otherwise you're going to be out-competed against by those
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   who are more productive in knowing how to use AI.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.880]   Yeah, I actually think it's not really a lesson for our children, because they definitely
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   will.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   It's really a lesson for people our age, and if you're 20 or 30 or 40 or 50, if you're
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.180]   not embracing it, yeah, you're going to have a disadvantage.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.640]   And so just talking about fundraisers for a second, I think that's also true for companies.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.880]   Having built a company, I find companies are like people, they age, they go through maturity,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.720]   they have cultural or personality quirks, and so our company, Fundrise, we have a team,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.760]   we're building with AI, and we're lucky because real estate, most real estate organizations
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.480]   have zero software engineers, let alone a guy with a machine learning master's and things
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   like that.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.280]   So we're lucky to be at this intersection between tech and real estate when AI comes
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.420]   along, and we've been messing around with it for a year, and for the first 10 months,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   we had nothing.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.680]   We just didn't have any way to use it, and it just was like, as you said, you can use
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.720]   it for summary and pretty silly, they're fine, but they're not world-changing.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.660]   But we just were like, "Okay, we're hacked away at it."
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.080]   And it's also how I got really both really confident about the kind of venture investments
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.200]   we made, because we were building and using the softwares, and also how I think about
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.760]   the trajectory of it, because we set up, we have open AI, API access, we've produced things
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.680]   with it, things we produced were crap, then we had to produce again, and then we realized
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   we needed data infrastructure, we got the data infrastructure, so you have to use it.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.000]   And it's like learning the piano or something, at first you're terrible, but you're basically
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.280]   too bad, you just have to keep going at it.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yeah, you got to keep going at it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.560]   And the toughest thing is, the older you get, I'm 46 now, the less you want to learn something
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   new, right?
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.600]   Old dog, new tricks, it's tough, but you got to really force yourself if you plan to be
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   productive, have a job, be an entrepreneur, you got to learn how to use it, folks, because
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.520]   the productivity gains are significant, and everybody else, at least the younger folks
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   or the hungrier folks are learning how to use it.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.640]   And in terms of profitability, it's interesting, because you follow the open AI debacle with
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.480]   them outing Sam Altman and bringing him back and those debate, and now the New York Times
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.040]   is suing open AI for plagiarism and using its content illegally, I guess.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.640]   It sure seems to me that open AI, for example, is highly profit-driven, because they started
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.040]   off as a nonprofit to help all of humanity, they're talking about using AI to help cure
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   disease and sequence this DNA and all that stuff, but now it seems like it's about max
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.960]   profitability.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   What are your thoughts there in terms of running a business and also helping humanity?
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.400]   I think that's good.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   It's like when I hear about a pharmaceutical company that invents something that saves
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.240]   millions of lives and they get really rich on it, I'm like, "Great."
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.600]   So the reality is that, look, I'm not some libertarian when it comes to recognizing the
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:45.480]   need for regulations, but capitalism drove more people out of poverty in the last 30
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.560]   years in China and Korea.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.000]   So I think that we're much better off with an open AI that is focused on delivering for
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.160]   the customer and getting paid for it than a government.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.760]   I'm sure China has basically a government version of it, and I just don't expect it
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.440]   to move as fast or be as good.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:13.120]   But I can see also why you basically better have good government control over the extreme
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.760]   outcomes that could happen.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.720]   This is more philosophical, but I thought we were going to talk about the portfolio.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.480]   I feel like the stuff I'm saying, everybody who's in this space, who reads this stuff
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.560]   and works with software, knows this stuff.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.040]   Maybe I'm too much of a nerd or something.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   No.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.680]   I think investing, do we really want to just invest to make money?
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   I think we need to invest for a purpose.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.240]   We need to use our gains for something.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.160]   And I'd love to talk more about portfolio.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.240]   So the construction of the portfolio, private growth companies, different verticals, it
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.720]   looks like 90% exposure to some way to AI.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.960]   If you could drill down to pure play AI companies, though, what percentage of that portfolio
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.520]   are those pure play?
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's just that depending on when this podcast comes out, I believe that AI is the revolution.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   Exactly how you feel about valuation and how many models there'll be, we can debate.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.120]   But I thought it was important, valuable to have exposure to those companies.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.880]   So we worked to get investments into what I think are the top AI companies, and that
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   took some doing.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.640]   It's 15% of the portfolio, so it's not.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.080]   Mostly the data infrastructure and the applications are where we invested.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.400]   I think they're at a much lower risk.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   Here's some stats.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   I have our weighted average by amount of dollars invested is 70% annual growth and over a billion
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   dollars in revenue.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.240]   So the point of the portfolio is that these companies are not startups.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.920]   They're rat-growing mature companies, and that's basically the best kind of venture,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.240]   in my opinion.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.640]   You can't get into those companies because, yes, you can get companies that you wish you
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.400]   could get open AI at the startup, or you wish you could get whatever, Uber at startup.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.440]   But the problem is you also get a hundred other ones that aren't.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   Sure.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.440]   So you're saying that later stage investing in private growth companies is more attractive
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.840]   because it has a proven roadmap.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.120]   It's growing revenue, it could be generating cash flow.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.160]   The thing is, you can't get in because everybody can see the trajectory of the company's growth
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:39.040]   and everybody wants in, but only a certain number of institutional investors or individual
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.960]   investors can invest.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   We got in, which was the part that the venture community said was impossible.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.800]   We were fortunate and lucky because in 2023 there was enough disruption in the market
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.640]   that we could basically provide a solution and capital and a differentiated approach
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.000]   that allowed us to get access.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Now we have that portfolio.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.080]   Hopefully we can then compound that success and those relationships with those companies
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   to do it again.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.120]   But if you look at the portfolio, I can list some of the companies that we invested in.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   This is at Canva.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.080]   There's a service Titan we invested in.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.480]   Here's one that's interesting, Anduril.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.760]   Are you familiar with them?
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.760]   No.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   So Anduril is application of AI to defense.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   Defense.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   That's big bucks.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.720]   That's a well that keeps on giving.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.000]   And I believe, they are aiming to, and I believe they'll be successful in becoming the next
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.880]   prime, like the next Lockheed Martin.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   And they are radically different than existing government contractors.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.520]   I mean, everything about them is different.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   And so let me give you this, let me like state it as a problem statement.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.720]   So if you look at the future of defense versus the past, basically you were looking at fighting
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.840]   the Soviet Union, and that's what the defense industry was designed to do.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.480]   And that basically meant massive amounts of really expensive hardware, you know, airplanes
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.760]   and aircraft carriers.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.560]   But Anduril was launched in 2017, but Ukraine has proven it out that the war is being driven
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.880]   by drones.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.400]   It loses 10,000 drones a month.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:29.840]   And so the risk of a swarm of autonomous AI controlled drones is such a radical departure
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.480]   from how we think about defense.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:44.120]   A thousand low cost drones could sink a $5 billion aircraft carrier or attack a city.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:52.640]   And so the defense of four drones and basically how all that connects to all military hardware
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.080]   and the people on the ground and in the air is changing rapidly.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   It's being driven by software, not by hardware.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.700]   And the primes, the big primes are not software companies.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:13.480]   And so there's just like total break in the way the industry needs to work.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:20.220]   And Anduril is, I mean, I think they're like the Tesla of defense industry, or they're
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.560]   like the SpaceX of the defense industry.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.020]   They're taking a radically different approach and they're succeeding.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.480]   And so I understand there's people going to be just as worried about the risks of it,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.100]   but you basically have to recognize how critically important it is, especially in the world.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:46.000]   This is how Hamas surprised Israel also, and this is what the Houthis are doing in the
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Red Sea today.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.940]   I mean, they're attacking with drones.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.180]   And so anyways, this is going to become critically important.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.500]   And we invested in Anduril and that was, I think, a really good example of an application
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.700]   of AI that is like a sector that is going to be transformed.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.940]   No, I mean, thanks for sharing that with me.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.300]   I've never heard of them.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.000]   And what you said makes a lot of sense in terms of defense, saving lives, protecting
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.420]   lives and using technology and money to defend freedoms versus lives.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.580]   I mean, it's pretty important stuff.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.780]   Oh, that's fascinating.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.860]   And so I named the three big investments we made in the applications, but they're each
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.060]   category dominant for their categories.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.220]   And same thing with data infrastructure.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.260]   Last time we talked about Databricks, they're absolutely category dominant for data industry.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:47.060]   And we also invest in DBT Labs, and I don't know if you have to be a data nerd to know
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:53.940]   probably that much about them, but basically they are the essential software for data industry.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.540]   Like anybody who's a data professional, data scientist, data engineer, uses them.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:07.740]   They've really transformed how data is transformed and understood inside our organizations.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.120]   It did it for us.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.820]   We have a lot of data, our real estate and investors, and we adopted DBT a couple of
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:20.660]   years ago and it just absolutely changed how we built and what was possible.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.380]   And then we wanted to see them, we want to invest in you.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:32.220]   And we ended up actually using us, Fundrise, and the application of DBT is like a marketing
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.220]   case study.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.140]   So I spent a lot of time trying to build a relationship with them, and then we were able
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140]   to invest in them.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.480]   And they're a singular company, there's nobody that's like a number two, and they are essential
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   and transformative.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.660]   So that's a company that most people never heard of, and it's just awesome, just awesome
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.660]   that we invested in them.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.660]   They're awesome.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.940]   It really sounds like a great plan in terms of your value add to be an investor in these
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.940]   companies.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.380]   Because if you're like, let's say a VC at a VC shop, right, you've got relationships,
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.860]   so your value add is, well, you have a good track record, you know other portfolio companies,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.420]   you can make introductions, help with hiring and marketing, whatnot.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.420]   But for Fundrise, it's like, you've got connections, you've got a team, you've got a company, you've
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.740]   got dollars, you can also become a client and help spread the good word about the company
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.740]   as well.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:26.700]   So to me, it seems like you all have a competitive advantage over a traditional VC who is not
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.900]   actually implementing that product in a multi-hundred person company.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.180]   Yeah, I think we have a small advantage and a big advantage.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.340]   The small advantage is that when I'm talking to somebody at those companies, I'm talking
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.060]   to a peer, I'm a customer, I understand the product, we use the product, we literally
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.380]   use almost all the products we've invested in.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.780]   And I think that makes us just a very different kind of party.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:57.700]   And then second, we have 2 million users and we are a marketing distribution platform.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.020]   I was talking to one of our companies, we told them we were going to send an investor
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.140]   update out, I don't know, a million people, and they're like, "What's it cost us?
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   How much do we pay you?"
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.140]   Yeah, you get the exposure if you let us invest in you.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:21.440]   Yeah, I mean, millions of potential customers, brand awareness, potentially if they ever
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.620]   go public, those are millions of retail investors.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.860]   I think about Databricks as an example.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.420]   Most people never heard of them, and they're going to go public probably in the next couple
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.420]   of years.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.540]   And the more people know about them, the more I think they'll be impressed.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:39.940]   And so there's just a value to the brand awareness that we can bring that's distinct, or as you
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.820]   said, competitive advantage over traditional venture funds who bring a different value.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.340]   I mean, I'm not going to try to bring the kind of value venture funds bring.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.340]   That's not realistic.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.340]   Right.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.340]   No, it's interesting.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:58.060]   Can we transition to talk about how an investor invests in an open-ended, permanent venture
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.260]   capital fund, such as the Innovation Fund?
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.620]   Because as you told us in a previous episode when we were talking about real estate, time
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.820]   is linear, but things happen in a nonlinear fashion.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.660]   And so the good thing about Innovation Fund is you can click on the link and you can see
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.280]   what y'all are holding, and then you can make a determination based on your holding whether
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.620]   you want to invest and how much.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:27.900]   But the way venture or private companies get valued is pretty chunky, right?
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.300]   It's like a revaluation upward or downward after another funding round.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.460]   So can you talk to us about the mechanics of, if someone wants to invest, they look
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.480]   at the portfolio like, "This is great, I'm going to invest $1,000, $10,000."
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.100]   How do they capture the returns of the fund?
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.100]   Yes.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.060]   I mean, this is, like I said, the same thing happens in real estate, where you basically
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.540]   have private market and public market, and people in the public market transact every
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.900]   second and expect change to happen every second.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.420]   In the private markets, it's the real world, right?
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   Like you're building companies, you're building buildings, you're under construction with
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.220]   a 200-unit apartment building.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.180]   What's the value of the building when the concrete's up and the roof's on and the glass
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.020]   is in, but you haven't put in the toilets?
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.260]   It's really difficult because you would look at that building and say, "Once it's opened
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:26.180]   and there's a certificate of occupancy, then it's a completed building and there's a binary
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.580]   change."
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.020]   And the same thing happens with tech companies, like they're worth $100 million, and then
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.340]   they raise a round and they're worth a billion.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.380]   And the day before they raised, were they worth $100 million?
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.020]   The day after they raised, are they worth a billion?
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.340]   And that's a very challenging dynamic in the private markets, because in both instances,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:50.100]   whether there's a building or a company, the change didn't happen overnight.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:56.500]   But when the building is completed and people are living in it, there is a step change difference.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.820]   When the company gets valued by a venture fund and they raise a billion dollars, there
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.940]   is a step change difference.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:09.100]   So we need to look at both sets of data, data that's binary, like if something changes,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.100]   that's an event, like a fundraising round.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   That's easy.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:18.060]   Or data that's non-binary, that's incremental, like the revenue has increased or they got
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.700]   a new big customer enterprise sale.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:29.900]   Take today, today we've built a pretty remarkable portfolio of private companies, but we can't
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.580]   really revalue them until there's some external input that changes the facts.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.500]   You make venture investments, you know that it takes a while before you really see external
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.460]   changes in valuation.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.100]   In terms of the fund mechanics though, so let's say a company was valued at a hundred
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.620]   million, raises capital, and now it's valued at five hundred million.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.700]   How does, and let's say the innovation fund holds that company, do you all revalue the
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.740]   company to be worth five hundred million, or do you have discretion to say, well, it's
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.980]   not five hundred million, you have a discount at two hundred fifty million?
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.580]   How much discretion do you have to value these companies, or what is the standard practice?
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.660]   Yeah, well, so our valuations get audited.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:20.040]   Every single investment gets audited by our auditor, so it's part of the fund structure
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.060]   that we're in, which is a 1940 Act registered investment company.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.980]   So they show up and they basically do independent valuation as well.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.660]   But ultimately, even when a venture fund invests in a company, they're doing independent valuation,
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.700]   and so typically there's a whole book, there's this massive book that's put out about how
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.660]   you look at valuation, and the best way to value something is a third-party independent
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:48.540]   transaction like a public market IPO or a third-party venture fund, and that's basically
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.700]   likely to end up being the valuation we would take.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.660]   But if it was an inside round, right, if it's an inside round, and so are they as independent,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.820]   that's more challenging.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.820]   Were there structured terms in it?
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.660]   Okay, headline valuation is $500, but there are all these structured terms around pref
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.060]   multiples and cram downs and things like that.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.180]   So yeah, you can't just look at the headline and take the evaluation.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.640]   You have to look at the fundamentals of the business, and you have to look at the terms
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   of it.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   Got it, okay.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.460]   Alright, so it's a little bit of an art as well as a science.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.340]   You know, as an investor, let's say I have a view that, okay, things are getting better,
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.780]   okay, rates are coming down, risk appetite is going up, public equities are up, you know,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:39.860]   24% for the S&P 500 in 2023, M&A is probably likely going to come back, the IPO market
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.920]   is likely going to come back, there's going to be a window of opportunity for private
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.940]   companies to go public.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:50.120]   Therefore, would it not be strategic to look at companies that are at the cusp of going
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:55.460]   public and invest in them before they go public to then capture that upside?
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:00.980]   I mean, obviously, the IPO valuation could decline, but in general, in a bull market
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:07.180]   or in a growing risk appetite market, those valuations are going to continue to increase.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.820]   So what do you think about that strategy?
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.180]   Yeah, I mean, without naming names, because one of the things I have to be sensitive to
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:17.980]   is the companies don't want me talking about them, and I mean, I'm not their CEO.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:25.100]   But if you look at our portfolio, the three most likely, sort of most exciting next companies
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.420]   to go public are in our portfolio.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.460]   Yeah, and we can all see that, and I think we can all make a deduction as to which ones
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.460]   they could be.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.780]   Yeah, and I think that'll be very validating for people.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.340]   I mean, again, this funny thing about tech is that, unless you're in the tech industry,
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.100]   you really haven't heard of all these companies.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:48.980]   We're not talking about name brands in most cases, but it's, yeah, I believe that some
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.620]   of these companies will go public the next year or two.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.940]   I think that they're really good companies, there's no question about that in my mind.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.860]   And exactly how the market values it, again, I'm not a short-term investor.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.940]   Even when some of these great companies went public, it didn't mean that they were no longer
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.500]   a good investment.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.380]   We have to have some of the fund in liquid assets because investors redeem every quarter,
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:18.620]   and so the way we did that in 2023, and even now we have the portfolio in bonds of tech
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:24.340]   companies, we basically felt like, when we started deploying the innovation fund, that
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:30.740]   our investors were not looking for us to take public market risk that they could take themselves.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.420]   So we focused on private tech companies, and then we had the rest of the portfolio in public
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.200]   tech bonds, which actually are not that easy to buy.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.260]   They usually hold lots that are a million dollars, and most people aren't buying public
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.260]   tech bonds.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.260]   We got pretty good yields.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.460]   I mean, it was a good time to buy tech bonds, and so we have to have some of the portfolio
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:55.420]   in liquid assets in order, basically, to have this hybrid fund, this crossover fund, democratizes
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.820]   investing in private markets, because otherwise there'd be no liquidity, and investors expect
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.580]   some limited amount of liquidity when they invest.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.020]   So let's say one of your portfolio companies goes public next year, there's a six-month
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.740]   lock-up period after IPO.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.580]   What is the decision process then, in terms of selling in the public market to capture
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.940]   that gain and liquidity, riding it out?
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.300]   Is there some type of standard which you all will operate, or is it dependent?
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.860]   No, it's going to be a micro-decision, a ground-up.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.580]   You look at the company, you look at what basically is worth pricing, its growth, etc.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.500]   And then you look at the portfolio.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.340]   And one of the great things about private markets, it's a funny thing about private
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.900]   markets, is actually, in some instances, you get more information than public markets.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.660]   Like a venture investor who invests in a company gets way more information than a public market
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.100]   S1.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:54.260]   And so today, at least if you look at the construction of the portfolio, the macros
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:01.020]   we invested in are really early in their growth cycle, AI is like a year old.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.980]   I mean, I don't think we would be a seller, I think we'd be, like, one of the reasons
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:11.020]   a company takes your money is because they want you to be a long-term holder.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.020]   They don't want somebody to just trade you, right?
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.900]   That's actually not a value-add partner.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.500]   And so, to get the best companies, you need to be like Warren Buffett.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:27.300]   You need to be low-touch, helpful if they want your help, and a long-term investor.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.620]   That's how you basically, I think, attract the type of companies that we want to invest
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.620]   in.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.620]   Right.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   No, no, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.060]   You don't want to be, you know, I don't know, the hedge fund investor who buys on a Monday
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.020]   and sells on a Friday after a 15% pop, right?
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.600]   You want to be long-term, value-added, you're right, low-touch, not a PITA.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.380]   Every time we sell, we trigger capital gains, right?
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.500]   Investor gets these capital gains, flow down to them, so the investor doesn't want, capital
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:02.780]   gains are a huge waste of, you lose, what is it, 37% between state and federal?
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   Right.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.380]   Yeah, I'm just thinking down the line, let's say five years from now, you know, more companies
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.420]   may go public, probably will go public in the portfolio.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:19.620]   And so, eventually, the mix might be a greater percentage of public company exposure versus
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.540]   private company exposure, because right now, it's...
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.540]   That's not our mandate, though.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.860]   I mean, our mandate is to be vast majority private.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   Right.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.580]   Currently, it absolutely is, and I think we can maintain that.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:37.420]   If I look at my lessons from 2021, if we were basically, we wouldn't be making a decision
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:43.420]   that private markets are overpriced, and we would be not investing and predominantly maybe
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:49.180]   back to bonds or something, because part of what the structure of our funds can do, which
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:54.980]   most people can't, most funds can't either, is that you can be allocating to private or
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   public.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.820]   So, that arbitrage between where the multiples or prices are more attractive, it's really
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.540]   uncommon, not just for individual investors, but even institutions.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:09.860]   Like venture funds can't really invest in public stock, and public funds can't invest
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.380]   in private, and that's like an arbitrage opportunity.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   Right.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.380]   Right.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.980]   Well, sounds pretty promising.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:22.620]   In conclusion, what are your thoughts for, I guess, the rest of 2024, and maybe a little
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.220]   bit 2025 in the venture capital land?
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:33.700]   I mean, the venture industry is basically today operating in two different environments.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.460]   Anything that's AI is basically priced like it's 2021.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.300]   Anything that's not AI is almost unpriced.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:50.420]   You have amount of venture capital dollars declined by 50%, 60% in the last two years,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:56.300]   so that's a good sign for investors, but at the same time, there's still markdowns from
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.800]   the peak that haven't happened yet.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.940]   And so, there's a lot of work.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.500]   I mean, the same thing with real estate, right?
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:08.020]   There's still a lot of change or reality to bring to bear on both industries, and that's
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.260]   going to take time.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.460]   The good thing about our fund structure is we don't have to be in a hurry.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.420]   We got a lot of good investments in 2023, and then we may slow down, unless we see something
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.420]   good, right?
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.020]   There's no reason to deploy.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.300]   All right.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:28.980]   Well, it seems like we're also passing the bottom for the venture capital industry, just
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.700]   like we're passing the bottom for the real estate industry.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:37.500]   So, in other words, it sounds like you are very optimistic and bullish, just like I am.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   Optimistic.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.140]   Are you optimistic, too?
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.580]   If we're aligned again, there's something...
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.580]   I'm very optimistic.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.660]   I mean, I live in San Francisco.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.620]   We're a startup city of the world.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.740]   All the AI companies are here.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.500]   Everywhere I go, everybody's talking about AI, whether I'm on the pickleball court, whether
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.620]   I'm playing tennis, I'm in the library, whatever, AI, AI, nonstop, or even at the Starbucks
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.500]   with some guy's laptop out.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.260]   So, it's everywhere.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.620]   I'm maybe a little bit worried about valuations, how are those going to shake out, but it sounds
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:15.180]   to me that investing in AI long-term is worth it.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.220]   And if you want to hedge against an interesting future, you want to have some exposure to
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   AI.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.700]   And so, that's what I'm going to be doing.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.940]   And I want to thank you for having this open-ended fund, where the investment minimum is only
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.420]   $10, and there's liquidity.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.540]   Well, thanks so much for coming on the Financial Samurai Podcast, Ben.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.660]   And maybe what we can do is a mid-year checkup to see how things are going and whether that
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.620]   optimism remains in both real estate and venture.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.220]   Yeah, that would be great.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   I love our conversations.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   All right.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.220]   And when you come out to San Francisco, we're going to grab a beer, and we'll reconvene
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.220]   then.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.220]   All right, everyone.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.220]   Thanks so much for listening.

[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.100]   We will talk to you all later.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.380]   Thanks everyone for listening to the conversation I had with Ben Miller, CEO and co-founder
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.680]   of Fundrise, about his outlook for venture capital in 2024 and beyond.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:14.180]   If you would like to explore the open-ended Fundrise Innovation Fund, you can go to financialsamurai.com/fundrise.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:24.900]   Unlike traditional closed-end venture capital funds, where you commit capital and then hope
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.740]   the fund makes wise investment decisions, you can first see what type of investments
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.940]   the Innovation Fund has made first, before deciding on if and how much to invest.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.860]   Fundrise is a long-time sponsor of Financial Samurai, and Financial Samurai is an investor
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.620]   in Fundrise funds.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.180]   Lastly, if you enjoyed this episode, I'd appreciate a rate, review, and a share.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.340]   Every single episode takes hours to record, edit, and produce.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:51.820]   Thanks so much.
