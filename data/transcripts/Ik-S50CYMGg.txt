[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   say that you decide you want to learn Swahili today and you go down to the
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.080]   local Swahili community center and you're like, cool, I'm going to immerse
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.600]   myself, like good luck, you know?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.220]   You can't even get started.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.960]   So through this lens, explicit practice is a way to bootstrap yourself.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.340]   Likewise, a great way to become a better musician.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.560]   All of the best pianists at sight reading that I knew in
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   university played with churches.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.400]   They were so good at sight reading because, you know, they had to show up
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.320]   every Sunday and they're playing a different thing, new hymn every Sunday.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.360]   So this is immersion also.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660]   And, you know, over time they're learning all these cadences and these things
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.340]   that are really common and whatever, but you can't show up and be the church
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440]   pianist every Sunday in the first place, if you don't already have some decent
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   foundation.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.800]   So this is sort of a bootstrapping argument that one role for explicit
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.240]   practice of this kind is to get yourself into a position where you can more
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.720]   naturalistically reinforce.
