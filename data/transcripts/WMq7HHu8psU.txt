[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the sixth chapter and the fourteenth verse.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I wonder whether there's anybody surprised that I still take this text on this Sunday evening before Christmas.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Is there somebody who says, "Surely on this Sunday you ought at any rate to be preaching on the birth of Christ,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   not on his death, on the incarnation, rather than on the atonement."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Well, my justification for doing this you will see as we proceed with this consideration.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   But I start from this position, that the great apostle doesn't say that he glories in the birth of Christ.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   He glories in the death of Christ, in the cross of Christ.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And this, of course, is a very significant point.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The world is ever ready to glory in the birth of Christ, but what it hates is the death of Christ.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So there is a very real significance in this statement of the great apostle,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   that he glories in the cross of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   As I've been indicating on previous Sunday evenings,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   the cross, the death of our Lord upon the cross, has always been an offense.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It's always been a stumbling block.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But it's the thing in which the great apostle glories.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And the reason he does so, as I've been trying to show, is this.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That he finds in the cross the center of everything.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Everything comes out of the cross.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Everything that he is, crucified to the world and the world unto him and so on.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Everything that he is, everything that he's received, everything he hopes to be,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   it all, he says, comes out of the cross.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And indeed he goes further and says this, that he now sees everything and understands everything
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   in the light of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He's found the key. The key to the understanding of himself, of man,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   of life in this world, of God's purposes of the future, everything.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Here is the key, without which we really do not even begin to understand any one of these things.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now what I want to try to show you tonight is this, that we don't even understand Christmas.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Except we look at it in the light of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So I am going to preach on Christmas. I am going to preach on the incarnation.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But I'm going to do that in a New Testament way and not in a worldly way.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Now the great danger always, with any great person, great personality,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   the great danger always is to fail to look at the life as a whole.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   To divide it up and to concentrate on particular aspects.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That's always a dangerous thing.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   If you really want to understand a man, any great man that's appeared in history,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   you've got to take him as a whole.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's important that you should know something about his birth, his antecedents,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and all that happened to him when he was young and in his formative years and so on.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But the great thing is that you should know the whole.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Each part casts light upon the other parts.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And when you come to something that is crucial, that's the thing on which you must concentrate.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Because it is generally in the light of that that you understand the rest.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Nothing I say is more dangerous than to divide up a life and to concentrate only on certain portions.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Now that's what the world does.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   The world likes Christmas.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But it doesn't like Good Friday.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It likes Christmas. Why?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, of course it can take that and it can idealize it and it can sentimentalize it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's the sort of thing that it really likes.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Something semi-magical, as it were, as it thinks of it.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Something beautiful.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Something that appeals to its imagination.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And something that it can pity in a sense and patronize.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The world has taken hold of Christmas and as we know it uses it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You get appeals this time of the year always for peace in industry, brotherhood, friendliness and so on.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Incidentally, I've noticed this year we've had less of it than I think we've ever had before.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The world is at last, I think, beginning to see that there isn't much in that.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That it's just something with which we delude ourselves for a couple of weeks
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and then forget all about it and go back to the ordinary bitterness of life as it is.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But the world has done that kind of thing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It thinks it understands the spirit of Christmas.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It thinks it understands this idea of a baby in a manger.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Now there's something beautiful, there's something wonderful.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And the world can rhapsodize about that and it can pour out its sentimentality.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And it feels better for having done so.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It feels that it's not so bad after all.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That it can always be tender to a little helpless baby
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and that it likes innocence and purity and beauty and things like that.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So the world, you see, takes it up and it likes to concentrate on this beginning.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But it doesn't like the end of the story.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And yet, you see, that's the thing that the apostle glories in.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And that is what makes me say this evening that it's obvious, therefore,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   that if we really are to understand the meaning of Christmas,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   we must take it in the light of the whole
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and we must take it especially in the light of the end
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and especially in the light of the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Because, you see, you can't stop at this birth.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   There is a babe lying in a manger.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   There are many questions that come to us at once.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Who is he?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Why should we be interested in him?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Why should we be concerned about him?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Why should we go to Bethlehem and have a look at him?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Who is this?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   What's he doing? What happened to him?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   What is this story that we are considering?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Is this the greatest tragedy the world has ever known?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Is this a life of failure, a life of disappointment, a life of defeat?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   What did it lead to?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You don't stop with a babe. He grew up.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   He became a man. What happened to him?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Now, I'm trying to show that you've got to ask all those questions
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and that you can't divide off just this beginning
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and put all your concentration on that and ignore the rest.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Indeed, I want to show that it's the exact opposite to that.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That this is a unique birth.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   That there had never been anything like it before it
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and there's never been anything like it since.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That there is that about this birth
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   which puts it in a class and in a category entirely on its own.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Now then, I put that in the form of this principle.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   That one cannot understand the birth of our Lord
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   except in the light of his death.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Now, that's something you can't say about anybody else
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and it puts a uniqueness upon him immediately at the very beginning.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I want, therefore, to show tonight how the apostle is perfectly justified
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   in saying that he glories in the cross, in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Because it is the thing that explains everything else.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And I want to try to show you
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   that you do not begin to understand this blessed person
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   except you view everything about him, his birth included,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   in the light of his death upon the cross.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Now, let me do it like this.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Before he ever came into this world
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   his coming had been prophesied, it had been predicted.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The Bible is divided into two great books.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   One is called the Old Testament, the other is called the New.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But you know, the real center of the message of birth
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   is just this one self-same person.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   The Old Testament is a book that looks forward to him.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It points to him.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   The Old Testament is rarely a book of prophecies.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   But you say, there's a lot of history in it, of course.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   But the history is rarely bound up with this prophecy.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Even the history of the Jews,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   which takes up the bulk of the Old Testament,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   it's nothing but a preparation for this person.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   That's the case which is made by the Old Testament itself.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   The Old Testament teaches that God took that man Abraham
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and turned him into a nation
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   in order that out of him might come this person,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   this deliverer, this Messiah.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So you begin to find at the very beginning of the Old Testament
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   that there are these foreshadowings,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   these prophecies of his coming.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And this is the interesting thing about them.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Every one of them in some shape or form prophesies his death.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Now let me just give you an example or two to illustrate what I mean.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   The very first prophecy that is given in the Bible
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   about the coming of the babe of Bethlehem into this world
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   is found in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You remember, don't you, how men sinned and fell?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And having sinned, having fallen,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   the men and the women realized their guilt and their unworthiness,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and they felt a sense of shame.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And then they suddenly heard the voice of God,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and they went and hid behind the trees.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They were afraid to meet him.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Until then they'd always rejoiced in his coming,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and had ran to meet him, to have communion with him.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And then they heard the voice of the Lord,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and they ran and hid.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   They're afraid, they're terrified, sense of guilt, and God called them out.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   He said, "Adam, where art thou?"
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And they came out, and he addressed them.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And you remember what he told them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   In its essence, it's this.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   He told them that they'd sinned grievously,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and that they must bear their punishment because of that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   You find it all there in that third chapter of Genesis,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   but I'm concentrating in particular on the 15th verse,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   which is actually the first prophetic utterance
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   concerning the coming of the Son of God into this world.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Listen.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Verse 14, "The Lord God said unto the serpent,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and above every beast of the field.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Upon thy belly shalt thou go,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy life.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And I will put in meaty between thee and the woman,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and between thy seed and her seed.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It shall bruise thy head,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and thou shalt bruise his heel.'"
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now then, here is the prophecy.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Salvation, deliverance, is going to come through the seed of the woman.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   God makes the promise at the very beginning.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Now that's why we rejoice in Christmas.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   God has promised that he's going to send a deliverer into the world.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   You see, because of sin, there is going to be this perpetual warfare
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   between man and evil, man and the devil.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's the cause of all the misery and the unhappiness of the centuries.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's out of this that all wars and pestilences and troubles have come.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But God promises a deliverer.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   One is going to arise who is going to be strong enough to bruise the serpent's head.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Here is the glorious promise of deliverance back.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You notice that accompanying it there at the very beginning is this other statement,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   that the devil and his fosses shall bruise, wound, his heel.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He's going to be wounded.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   The deliverer is going to be wounded.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   There is no deliverance apart from suffering and apart from being wounded.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   So the very first prophecy concerning his coming is one that is accompanied
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   by this foreshadowing of his suffering, his being wounded, his bearing pain and sorrow.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And I could take you right through the Old Testament
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and show you the selfsame principle coming out everywhere.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Take for instance that great 53rd chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   There he is, the deliverer again.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   He comes like a root out of dry ground, unexpected, inexplicable.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   He doesn't naturally arise out of the process of evolution.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   No, no, he suddenly appears, inexplicable.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   That's exactly how the babe of Bethlehem came.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Ah, yes.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   But we notice that his visage is marred.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   We notice that he is led as a lamb to the slaughter.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   We esteem him smitten, stricken of God.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   We see him bearing our sicknesses and our diseases.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   We see him going through an agony of suffering.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Perhaps the high water mark of all prophecy in the Old Testament.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   But you notice that it concentrates upon a suffering Messiah.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   A Messiah who is bruised, who is stricken, who is wounded for our transgressions,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   who bears our sicknesses and diseases.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   My dear friends, you see, this is the Bible
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and it's so different from our worldly way of looking at these things.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now, now, as the Bible predicts the coming of this babe,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   it doesn't go off into the language of fairy tales and of fences.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   The Bible is a realistic book.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And all this sham pretense of happiness at Christmas has no place in the Bible.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Why? Well, because the Bible knows the truth about the world.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It knows it's a place of suffering, it's a place of sin.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   The novels are not true. Life is not a romance.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Life is stark realism. It's blood, sweat, tears, toil, suffering, agony, shame.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   That's the world and the Bible never loses sight of that.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   The Bible has no magic to offer.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It's a very realistic book.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And so it tells us all along in the Old Testament
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   that when the Messiah comes into the world, he's going to suffer.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He's going to end upon a cross.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Everything in the Old Testament points up to this.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It tells us that he's going to be sold for 30 pieces of silver and so on.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But let me sum it all up.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   In the great words of John the Baptist,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   here he is, our Lord, grown up now, sets out in his public ministry.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And the last of the great prophets of Israel was this man called John the Baptist.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Here's the forerunner, here's the herald of his coming.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And do you remember what he said about him?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   He pointed to him and said, "Behold, the greatest teacher the world has ever known.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Behold, the greatest moral exemplar, nothing of the sort.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Behold, he says, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You see, the whole of the prophetic message comes to a point, as it were, a focus,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   in those words of John the Baptist.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   "There he is," he says. "Well, what is he?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Is he a king? Is he a prince? Is he a great military conqueror? No, no.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Now, the apostle Peter, in the same way exactly,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   he sums up the whole of this prophetic message of the Old Testament in these words.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Listen to him.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   In the first epistle, first chapter, verses 10 to 12,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   "Who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   which things the angels desire to look into."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But there's the prophetic message.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   The whole of prophecy is pointing to the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You see, the biblical message doesn't glory in the birth, it glories in the cross.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   The sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Very well then, I am right in saying that the great prophetic message of the Old Testament
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   always points us to this thing in which the Apostle Paul gloried.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And it's exactly the same with all the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Has this ever occurred to you?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   There are people who say, "I'm not interested in the Old Testament. I don't want it.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's all about blood and sacrifices and things like that."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Of course it is.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Because the whole of the teaching of the Old Testament is a teaching that points to the cross.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   That is why, you see, you get it in the case of the two brothers, Abel and Cain.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Abel's sacrifice was accepted, Cain's was refused.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Why? Because Abel brought a blood sacrifice.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   He has sacrificed an animal, whereas Cain just took a kind of vegetable sacrifice.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And God was pleased with the sacrifice of Abel.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Why? Well, he'd already taught the infant human race that sacrifice is essential.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   There it is at the beginning.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And on it goes right away through.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Read your book of Genesis.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And you'll find that the father, the head of the house, was, as it were, a sacrificing priest.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   He led in worship.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And then as you go on and you read those books of Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and so on,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   you say, "I'm utterly bored by it all, all these details about the temple.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   What's the point of all this? What's it got to say?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Why should I be interested in the temple?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Why should I be interested about the measurements and the color of the various things that are put there?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Why should I be concerned about the altar and the various altars in the temple?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   What's it all got to say to me?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Why must I read about all these bulls and goats and the high priest putting his hands upon them
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and then killing them and taking the blood and once a year taking it into the holiest of all in the tabernacle in the temple?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   What's it all got to do with me?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   What's the meaning of an altar?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Why sacrifice? Why blood?"
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And you see there's only one answer.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It is all pointing forward to the cross on which this babe that was born in Bethlehem ultimately died.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's an amazing thing, this.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But the whole of the Old Testament points to this,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   the very thing in which the apostle says that he glories above everything else.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Very well. There is my first point then, that even the preparation for his coming
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   all puts its emphasis upon his death upon the cross.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   But let me put it still more plainly to you.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And this is a very startling thing.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   The cross was the real object of the incarnation.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Now that's the unique message.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me put it to you again in terms of the ninth verse in that second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   that I read to you at the beginning.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Listen to this.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Here's your Christmas message.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Now this is a tremendous statement, you see. Here it is.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   What's that mean?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Well, if you read the first chapter of this great epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   you will find that this babe of Bethlehem is described like this.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and upholding all things by the word of his power,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   when he hath by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   being made so much better than the angels,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And then he goes on in the rest of that first chapter just to say this.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That this babe of Bethlehem, whom he says is the Son of God,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   He is the one, he says, by whom God made the worlds.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   He is the one who upholds all things by the word of his power.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   He made the angels. He made everything else that is.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   But here he says, "We see Jesus, this babe of Bethlehem,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   who was made a little lower than the angels."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   That's another way of saying that he was born as a babe.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   "For a man is lower than the angels.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   The angels are more mighty than men, they're greater than men.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   These bright angelic beings created by God have greater power than men.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Man is lower than the angel."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And this is the astounding thing.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   The Son of God was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   In other words, the babe that is born in Bethlehem is the eternal Son of God.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   God says this man in times past had spoken to the nation of Israel by great men,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   by prophets and seers and patriarchs and people like that.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   But he's now done something amazing. He's spoken unto us in his Son.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Here is one who has come from the glory everlasting and has been born as a helpless babe.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   He's made lower than the angels.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   But why did he ever come like that? Why was he ever born?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Why did the Son of God ever become a man in this world?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Why was he made a little lower than the angels? And you notice his answer.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   "For the suffering of death, that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man."
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   He repeats it again in the 14th verse.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   he also himself likewise took part of the same,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject abounded."
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Do you get it?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   "For as much then as the children, that you and I are partakers of flesh and blood,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   that we are human beings, we are men lower than the angels,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   he also himself likewise took part of the same,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   in order that through death he might destroy him
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   that had the power of death, that is, the devil,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject abounded."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now then, this is, I think, a crucial statement.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   What the man is saying is this,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   that you don't understand the meaning of the Incarnation,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   the coming of the Son of God into this world,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   the birth of the Son of God as Jesus, the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   You don't understand it unless you understand the meaning of his death upon the cross.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   So I, in the name of this great word, make bold to assert again
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   that you don't understand Christmas unless you understand Calvary.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And if you don't understand Calvary, your ideas about Christmas are going to be wrong.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   They're going to be worldly, they're not going to be spiritual.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   You're going to idealize it into something that isn't true.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You don't realize why he came.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   You're going to say, "Marvelous, beautiful, wonderful,"
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and you'll pour out your sentiment,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and you'll forget that this is a world of sin and evil, damned and lost,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and that he came into the world for one reason only,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and that is that he might die.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Now this is an astounding thing.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   The Son of God didn't come into the world in order to teach us.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He did teach, but that isn't why he came into the world.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   He wasn't made a little lower than the angels in order that he might teach us.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   God could teach us, as he did, through prophets
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and through all the other ways that he adopted in the Old Testament.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   That isn't why he came, and there's a very good reason for that.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Let me put it again once and forever clearly in this pulpit.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   If the Lord Jesus Christ had done nothing in this world
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   but give us the teaching that he gave to men and women,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   we would all be damned, every one of us.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   You see how simple it is to talk about the spirit of Jesus
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   and the spirit of Christmas and the Sermon on the Mount
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and the wonderful ethics and morality and so on,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   but my dear friend, what you are asked to do is to live that and to practice that,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and you can't do it.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You see, God had given teaching to the people through the Old Testament prophets.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   The teaching is there in the Ten Commandments and the moral law,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   but the trouble was that nobody could keep it.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And if nobody can keep the Ten Commandments and the moral law,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   how much less can they keep Christ's interpretation of it all in the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It's impossible.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   His teaching condemns us, every one of us.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And in the same way, let me point out that he didn't come into this world
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   in order to give us an example how to live.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   This has been popular, hasn't it?
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Ah, here it is.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Teaching is one thing, but we want help.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   We want the stimulus, a fillip to our endeavor,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and at last here is an example.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And now we've got to set out in the imitation of Christ.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   That was the teaching, Thomas Akempis, "Imitation of Christ,"
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and many followed that line.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But "Imitation of Christ," have you ever considered what it means?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Have you ever considered the demands?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   It's all right, you know, to sit in a comfortable armchair
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and read about the imitation of Christ.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It's beautifully written, it's wonderful literature,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and it's the whole idea, of course, it's marvelous that we rise up and we live
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   this wonderful, idyllic, idealistic life.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   But have you done it? Can you do it?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Has anybody ever succeeded?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Some of the greatest men the world has ever known have tried that,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   and they've ended in utter, absolute despair.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   All the honest ones see that they're complete and entire failures.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   The example of Christ is my greatest condemnation.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   He didn't come into the world to teach, nor to give an example.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   He came, he was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   for the suffering of death,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   that he, by the grace of God, might taste death for every man.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   He came into this world with one deliberate object,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   and that was to die.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And that is why I say that his coming was unique.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Adam was created to live.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   We are all born in order to live.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Here is one who was born in order that he might die.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And according to these men, there's only one explanation of death,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   and that is the grace of God,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   that he, by the grace of God, might taste death for every man.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   If you want to know the meaning of Christmas, it is this,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   that God so loved this world of sin and evil and shame and vileness,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that he sent his only begotten, dearly beloved Son from heaven into it.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   He sent him who'd been with him in the glory everlasting throughout all eternity,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and who was the express image of his person and the brightness of his glory.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   He sends him out of that into this.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And he sends him into it in order that he might die.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   There was only one object in the coming of the Son of God into this world,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and it was because he had come to die.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Why?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And the answer is that it is the only way whereby he can save us.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   By being born as a baby in Bethlehem, he humbles himself in a most amazing manner,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   but that doesn't save us.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I say it with reverence that as God in heaven, he couldn't save us.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   By remaining in heaven, the Son of God even couldn't save us.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The Son of God had to come into this world.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He had to take on him human nature.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   He had to become a man.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Why?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Because there is no other way whereby he can save us.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Well, what is necessary, you say, to our salvation?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Well, this is what is necessary.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Mankind has broken the law of God.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Men have sinned against God.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   He's flouted his laws.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   He's desecrated the sanctities.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   He stands convicted and condemned at the bar of God's eternal judgment.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   God's holy law comes down upon him, and he's convicted and he's condemned,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and he's absolutely hopeless, and the punishment of sin is death.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   How can we be saved?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   This is what is necessary to our salvation.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   The law of God must be honored.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   The law of God must be fulfilled.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   The everlasting law of righteousness, the holy character of God,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   must be vindicated and established as supreme over all.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   There's no compromise in that.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   It's essential.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So if we are to be saved, someone must represent us.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Someone must render on our behalf a perfect obedience to the law of God.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Someone must bear the punishment of sin meted out by the law of God.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And there was no man that could do it.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Adam had tried and had failed.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Adam was our first representative and he failed.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   The devil defeated him and down he went, bringing calamity upon himself
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   and all who've come out of him.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Men cannot do it.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his own son,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   God said, "I'll send my own son.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I'll make him a man.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'll make him add human nature to himself
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and there is the second man, the representative of a new humanity.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   He will render perfect obedience to my law
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and he will bear the punishment of the sins of men.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I will make him my lamb.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   I will lay the iniquity of men upon him.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I will smite him in their place.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I will deal with sins in him."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And without that no one could ever be saved.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So you see, he was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   not that you and I might admire and sentimentalize over the beautiful babe
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   in the manger in Bethlehem
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and feel how beautiful and how wonderful and how wrong of the world
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   not to make room for them in the inn
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   so that he might be born in a bed instead of in the straw
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and, oh, indulge in all our little fancies
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and our hypocrisy and our shame and our utter vileness.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   No, no.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   He was made a little lower than the angels
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   for the suffering of death.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   He was born in order that he might die.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   It is the cross that explains the incarnation.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I don't see why he should be made a little lower than the angels
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   unless I understand the message of the cross.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   The evil of the world and the evil in my own heart
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and the righteousness of God and his holy law
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and the absolute necessity of a sacrifice and atonement,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   a substitute for me and for my sins.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It is the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ that alone explains
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   the babyhood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and all the miracle of Bethlehem.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   It's the cross that alone explains it,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   for in order that.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   That's why he came.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   But let me hurry on to show you this.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It is the cross alone that explains
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   some of the most extraordinary things that were ever said about him.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   You remember the archangel Gabriel when he went to Mary
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   to announce his coming, he said astounding things about him.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   He called him a holy thing and he said that his kingdom
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   was going to have no end and that he should reign over all and forever and ever.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   King! How is he going to do it, this helpless babe?
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And it's on the cross he obtained his victory.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It was there that he was able to say that the prince of this world had been cast out.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   It is there he triumphed over the principalities and powers,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   putting them to an open shame and triumphing over them by it.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   It explains that. And then it explains the extraordinary statements made by old Zacharias.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   You remember the father of John the Baptist.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   He was muddled, he couldn't understand,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   but suddenly he is given divine revelation and inspiration,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and he cries out saying, "God hath visited
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   and redeemed his people."
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   He said, "It's all right, this son that's been born to me and to Elizabeth
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   is going to be the forerunner of this great deliverer, this Messiah.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   God's done it, he saw it proleptically, he saw it as if it had already happened.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   This is prophetic vision. He's done it.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   God hath visited and has redeemed his people.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   This little babe is going to be the redeemer.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   How is he going to redeem? He's going to redeem by being the Lamb of God,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   the lamb that God is providing.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   He looks, you see, immediately to the cross.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   It's the only explanation of his statement.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   It is likewise the only explanation of the statement, you remember,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   that was made by the angels and by the angelic hosts
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   to the shepherds who were watching their flocks by night.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Suddenly the angel appears to the shepherds and they're frightened.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   for behold I bring you tidings of great joy,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   which shall be to all people.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   which is Christ the Lord."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   What significant terms! A Saviour! He's a Christ, he's the Anointed One.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   What's it all mean? Oh, he's going to deliver.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   This is the one that is prophesied and predicted.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And he's going to do it by making a sorrow, an offering, and a sacrifice for sin.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But let me give you another extraordinary statement.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   You remember that very beautiful story we are told of how
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   when his mother had taken this infant Jesus into the temple to make her offering,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   a great old man. This same man was just and devout,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And he came by the Spirit into the temple,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   the man took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   which thou hast prepared before the face of all people,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   We read that Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Then listen, "And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother,"
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   listen to this, this child has only just been born,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   but this is what this man filled with the Spirit says to Mary, the mother of our Lord,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   'Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   and for a sign which shall be spoken again,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   yea, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.'"
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He tells of this young mother and the child's only newly born,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   he says, "Look here, because of this child, a sword is going to pierce through thine own soul also."
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   He is prophesying the cross and the death on Calvary's hill.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   All these things were said about him the moment he was born, the cross alone explains it.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   These things are meaningless gibberish, unless you see the meaning of the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   The cross also explains everything that happened to him.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Everybody knows the story how King Herod tried to kill him,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   murdered all those male infants in order to try to do so.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   What made him do it?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Oh, what made him do it was not merely concern about his own throne,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   he had become a tool of the devil at that point.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And it's the devil who is trying to defeat this great act of this Messiah
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   that is going to set men and women free.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   What's the meaning of the antagonism of the authorities,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   the Pharisees, the scribes, the Sadducees, the doctors of the law?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   What's the meaning of it all?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Ah, it's just this enmity that he's come to deal with.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   It's the foe that he's come to conquer.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And then think of an astonishing incident in his life,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   that which took place on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Do you remember it?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   One day our Lord took Peter and James and John,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   and he took them up onto a great mountain,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and there he was transfigured before them.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And his very face became filled with glory,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and his very clothing began to shine in a manner above the shining of the best fuller,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   that the best fuller can produce.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   He was transfigured and transformed.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   What's the meaning of this?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   And two men appeared in a like shining manner,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Moses and Elias, Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   One of the most extraordinary things that ever happened to this person,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   whom we are considering together.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   What's the meaning of it?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Well, the record will tell you.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   They discussed with him the exodus that he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   They were discussing his death with him,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   the representative of the law and the representative of the prophets.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   They knew he'd come for this, and they were discussing it with him.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   It's the only explanation.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   You see, if you don't understand the cross,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   you don't understand the history of this person as you have it in the four Gospels.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   In exactly the same way, the cross, his death upon the cross,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   is the only explanation of some of the extraordinary things that he did himself,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   his behavior while he was here.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Look at this babe, watch him growing up, see some of the things that he did.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   One day he went to John the Baptist and asked John the Baptist to baptize him,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and John, really naturally, demurred and objected to doing this.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   What is the meaning of this?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   What is the explanation of this?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And the answer is given to us in all these Gospels.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   John couldn't understand this, and he put it to him.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   He said, "I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   John said, "I can't baptize you. You ought to be baptizing me.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   I'm a sinful man, you are without sin. Why do you come to me to be baptized?"
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And Jesus answering said unto him, "Suffer it to be so now,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Then John suffered him. What's that mean?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It means this, my friend.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   He had been born as a baby in Bethlehem. He had come into this world.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   He was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   in order that he might redeem us from our sins.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   What's the meaning of his baptism?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Oh, he's identifying himself with us and our sins.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   He was without sin. He had no need to be baptized.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   He's identifying himself.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He says, "It's thus, and thus alone, that it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Can you give me an exposition, I wonder, of the shortest verse in the Bible?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   What is the shortest verse in the Bible? It's this, "Jesus wept."
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Why did he weep?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   "Ah," you say, "he was weeping because his friend Lazarus had died.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   He was feeling sorrowful. It was but natural human sympathy."
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   No, no, that's quite wrong.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   He knew that he was going to raise Lazarus. He'd gone there to do it.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Why did he weep?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   "He wept and he groaned in the Spirit because
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   he was looking into the face of sin, this horror that has entered into the world
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and that has brought death into the world and all suffering into the world.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And he knew that before he could deal with it and set his people free,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   he'd got to pass through that himself. He groaned, he wept.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   He had been warned that Herod and the authorities in Jerusalem wanted to arrest him,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   and yet I'm told that he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And yet there's nothing more remarkable about him than his lack of hurry.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   He seems to know what's happening.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   How do you explain the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   when he's to be seen sweating great drops of blood?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   What's the matter?
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Is he just afraid of death?
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Is he less than the martyrs?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Is he less than many a human being that's died for a noble cause?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Why is he sweating?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Why does he say, "If it be possible, let this cup pass by"?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Oh, it's because he knows what his death is going to involve,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   the agony of being separated from his father,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   the thing he'd come into the world in order to do,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and yet he knows it's going to be so terrible.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   So he agonizes in the Garden and he sweats drops of blood.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   You can't understand these things
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   unless you understand the meaning of the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And in the same way you don't understand his teaching.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   He keeps on talking about the hour.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He says, "My hour has not yet come."
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   He says, "Your time is always with you.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Mine hour has not yet come."
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And there just before the cross he says, "The hour is come."
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   The hour. He'd come for an hour, for an event, for an act.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Everything points to the hour.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   What is this? Oh, it's his death upon the cross.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   He'd come for this hour. He says, "What shall I say?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Father, deliver me from this hour,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   but for this hour came I into the world."
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   He says it himself.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   He came into the world in order that he might arrive
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   at the hour of his death when the sun was darkened
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   and the graves were opened and the veil of the temple was rent.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   The hour.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   He was born for that hour.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And so he was able to say, "The things concerning me have an end."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   He says, "I am the good shepherd,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   and the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   He says, "No man taketh my life from me.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   I lay it down and I take it up again."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   He knows what he's doing. He's come to do it.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   You don't understand his life, his birth, his life, his teaching,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   the things that happen to him.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Nothing is understood except in the light of his death upon the cross.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   But here, to me, is one of the most marvelous and wonderful things of all.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Why does the apostle Paul glory in his death on the cross rather than in his birth?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   The apostle has given himself a very wonderful answer to that question
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   in his great epistle to the Philippians and in the second chapter,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   where he puts it in these words.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Listen to this. Here's the account of it all.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   who, being in the form of God,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   but made himself of no reputation,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   and took upon him the form of a servant,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and was made in the likeness of men,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   and being found in fashion as a man,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   he humbled himself and became obedient unto death,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   even the death of the cross;
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   wherefore God also hath highly exalted him,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   and given him a name that is above every name, etc."
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   What does it mean?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Well, I like to think of it like this.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   The cross is the very lowest point
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   of the journey of the Son of God.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   It is the focal point of his humiliation.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   It is the lowest depths that he ever reached.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Have you ever thought about the journey of the Son of God?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Here it is.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He starts from eternity. He was in the form of God.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   He was God, God the Son.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   "The Word that was in the beginning,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   with God, and the Word which was God,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   there he is in the glory everlasting,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   he'd always been there, that's his home,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   in the bosom of the Father."
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   But he sets out upon a journey,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   and he comes out of the glory,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   laying aside the signs of that glory,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   making himself of no reputation.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   "And he is born in the likeness of men."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   "He took upon him the form of a servant
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   and was made in the likeness of men."
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   There's his birth at Bethlehem,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   but you notice, it's only a station on the journey.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   He didn't come to arrive in Bethlehem,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   he just stops there.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   That's a stopping point, that's a halting point,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   that's a place where he, as it were,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   spends a night in his journey.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   But he goes on.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   "And being found in fashion as a man,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   he humbled himself."
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   He did all that we find described
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   in the pages of the four Gospels, and he suffered.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   The contradiction of sinners against himself
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   was tempted in all points like as we are,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   but he went on,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   "And he humbled himself and became obedient."
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   "And obedient unto death."
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Listen, "Even the death of the cross."
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   And there is the limit of the downward journey.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   "Even the death of the cross."
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   The death of a felon, the death of a culprit,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   the death of one who has broken the law.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   "Cursed is every one that dieth upon a tree."
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   And there he is, dying on a tree,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   the lowest depth.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   He came from the height of glory,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   there, and there's the depth.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   And from that moment he begins the return journey.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Wherefore,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   "God hath highly exalted him."
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   It started in the resurrection,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   and then in the appearances,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and then in the ascension,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   and then the passing through the heavens
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   and the seating at the right hand of God
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   in the glory everlasting.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Why do I glory in the cross rather than in Bethlehem?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Bethlehem's merely a stage, it's a step.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   He came to go down to the depths,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   even the death of the cross.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   That's the lowest one.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And then he began the return journey.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   And there he is, back in the glory,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   which he had with the Father from the beginning.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Seated at his right hand in all the splendor
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and the wonder of it all.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Leaving the courts of heaven and being born as a babe,
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   being made Lord of the angels,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   is wonderful beyond description.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Sharing life with men and women
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and working as a carpenter
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   is something that imagination buggles at.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   The fact that he should be tempted and tried
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   in all points like as we are yet without sin,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   it's amazing and astonishing.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   But by the side of the cross is nothing.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   There God the Son dies.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   The author of life expires.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   He touches the lowest depth
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   from the highest throne of glory
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   to the cross of deepest woe.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   There is the journey, the span.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   He gets the limit.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   And he went to that limit even the death of the cross.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   For you and for me,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   he was born in order that he might die.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   He came into the world to die.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Was made a little lower than the angels
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   for the suffering of death.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   That he by the grace of God
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   might taste death for everyone.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   There's the limit of the descent.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   The lowest point conceivable.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   But he went all the way.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   He trod the winepress alone.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   When all forsook him and fled, he went on.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And he bore it, broke his heart and died.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Wherefore, God hath highly exalted him
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and given him a name that is above every name
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   He has been glorified with this great name above all
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   because, wherefore, he was obedient unto death.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Even the death of the cross.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   God forbid that I should glory.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Not even in the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   But in that babe of Bethlehem who has come there
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   in order that he might undergo the sufferings of death.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   That I through his stripes might be healed.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   He died to make us good.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   He was made a little lower than the angels
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   for the suffering of death.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Amen.
