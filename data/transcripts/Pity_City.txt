[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about pity city
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.960]   why people don't stand up more for themselves and maybe how the fire movement isn't dead yet.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.440]   I don't know if you've heard but the CEO of Herman Miller, those Herman Miller chairs for $750 and up
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.840]   ripped her employees for asking about a raise. How dare they ask about a raise, get stuff done,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   have a listen and then once we listen we'll discuss more about the fire movement and why
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.200]   it's important to stand up for yourself with some other examples as well. Great question Chris, you
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.680]   know a lot of questions came through about how can we stay motivated if we're not going to get a bonus
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.560]   what can we do what can we do some of them were nice and some of them were not so nice so I'm
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.680]   going to address this head on. The most important thing we can do right now is focus on the things
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.080]   that we can control. None of us could have predicted COVID, none of us could have predicted supply
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.640]   chain, none of us could have predicted bank failures but what we can do is stay in front of
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.600]   our customers, provide the best customer service we can, get our orders out our door, treat each
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.400]   other well, be kind, be respectful, focus on the future because it will be bright. It's not good
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.560]   to be in a situation we're in today but we're not going to be here forever. It is going to get
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.640]   better so lead. Lead by example, treat people well, talk to them, be kind and get after it.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.760]   Don't ask about what are we going to do if we don't get a bonus. Get the damn 26 million dollars,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.440]   spend your time and your effort thinking about the 26 million dollars we need and not thinking about
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   what are you going to do if we don't get a bonus. All right can I get some commitment for that? I
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.960]   would appreciate that. I had an old boss who said to me one time, you can visit pity city but you
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.640]   can't live there so people leave pity city, let's get it done. Thank you, have a great day. Damn,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.600]   well what do you think folks? Are you inspired by the talk or are you a little miffed, a little
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.280]   irate? Well if I heard that I'd be like wow you know what I'm gonna leave pity city and this job
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.600]   behind and I'm gonna check out what else is there to do because when you're feeling down the last
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   thing you want to do is get pissed on by your boss who it turns out had a 1.29 million dollar bonus
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.680]   in 2022 and a 1.129 million bonus in 2021 and their total compensation in 2022 was over five
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.800]   million dollars. So come on now if you're making mega million dollars I don't think it's wise to
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.280]   piss on your employees. 26 million dollar order? Man if I got a 26 million dollar order for my
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   products I would demand at least what a 500,000 maybe a million dollar bonus. I don't know is
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.720]   that too much nowadays two and a half to five percent of the order amount as a salesperson?
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.400]   It sounds to me like these type of orders are more appropriate for a c-level executive earning
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.480]   one and a half to five million dollars. If Andy Owen the CEO received a zero bonus and cut her
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.160]   salary her rally cry for employees to work harder and not care as much about their compensation
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   would have been taken way better. But she's a top 0.1 percent earner who makes millions a year
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.440]   and unfortunately I just found out she is also a fellow William and Mary alumni. Sorry folks
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.720]   most graduates I've met from this fine public institution are quite humble they're pretty low
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.960]   key so she doesn't speak for all of us. I think it's very important for all employees to know
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:53.760]   that public company CEOs care most about profitability second about their people and
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   they only care about their people to the extent that their people their employees are being as
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   productive as possible to generate as much money as possible. You don't see the executives from
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.960]   Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, Credit Suisse saying look I'm going to give you guys back my
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   millions and millions of dollars in compensation from 2021 and 2022 because hey those investment
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.880]   decisions caused our banks our companies to get torpedoed into the ground and resulting in
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   billions of dollars of shareholder value loss and thousands and thousands of jobs lost. No you don't
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.120]   hear that the reason why is because everybody is out there for themselves. The executives number
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.480]   one goal is to make shareholders money and to make themselves money. Please if you are an employee
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   even a middle manager your job is to not make your job your life instead you should increasingly view
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.720]   your day job as a place for transaction not for spiritual growth. Your day job is there to mainly
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.760]   make you money so you can have more options to do what you want and that's mostly it. Potentially
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.920]   making friends out of colleagues and feeling like you have a purpose at your day job are side
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.520]   benefits. It's kind of sad but it's true these are side benefits. If you receive them great but don't
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   expect them. Conversely your boss is there to extract as much productivity out of you as possible
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.280]   to make as much money as possible from you and the firm. Think like management not like an employee.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.840]   We talked in the past about how meritocracy is declining. People aren't rewarded as much for
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.120]   their hard work and accomplishments as they were in the past and the reason why is because of society
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.360]   and office politics. Office politics is growing folks. The higher you climb on the corporate
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.200]   ladder the more office politicking you need to do. You need to continuously sell yourself
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.680]   internally as much as you sell yourself externally to get paid and promoted. After every review you
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.400]   must highlight your accomplishments and the value you have provided to your company. Then you've got
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:18.160]   to come up with an agreed upon bonus amount, salary amount, title by a certain date. Keep
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   their feet to the fire. You need this all in writing because if you can perform you need to
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.800]   get paid. None of this hey in the future you know you're sacrificing for the team you'll get paid
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.480]   and rewarded and promoted two years from now if you're a loyal soldier. That two years might never
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.280]   come. Look out for yourself first. A written plan is a must to hold your managers accountable. I was
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   a manager once and I was managing my managers in my career to get to VP level by 27 and executive
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.960]   director level by 31. But I hit that ceiling that glass ceiling where I couldn't get to managing
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   director. I tried for one year. I held them accountable. I said this is my performance
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.000]   and then they said sorry you're not going to get promoted and we're not going to pay you as much.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.240]   You know you got to subsidize the fixed income department. Sorry it's just one team one dream.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   I get it. So instead of complaining I figured a way out and that way out was to negotiate a
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.840]   severance so I can get all my deferred compensation of three years of cash in stock plus my seven year
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.920]   bullet of this investment in mortgage backed securities out of Japan and other countries that
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.360]   management forced us to make as part of our bonus back in 2010. And it wasn't going to get paid out
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.840]   until 2017 and there was no way I was going to leave that money behind. So I decided to take
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.400]   action for a suboptimal situation and I'm better for it and that is what I want all listeners to
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.840]   do. It's fine to visit pity city you know the place where you feel sorry for yourself and all
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:00.560]   your problems. I think we've all been there before but complaining why life isn't fair is not the
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.320]   financial samurai way. We're all given different strengths and weaknesses. Some of us have serious
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.720]   disabilities to overcome. 15% of the world's population has some disability. How we make the
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.440]   most of our differences is what matters and we're always going to fight on. Negotiating a severance
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   sounds probably foreign probably weird to most folks. The constant feedback I get from some
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.920]   people is this. Sam I could never do that to my employer and negotiate a severance. I am valued
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.440]   so much. The reality is these are the same people who are too weak to fight for their pay and
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   promotion. As a result they get passed over for the people who do. I wanted my wife on this podcast
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.440]   to share her side of the story about you know why she didn't want to negotiate her severance for a
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:58.480]   whole year even though I had negotiated mine in 2012. But she's dealing with a passport fire drill
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.440]   because she lost it and she now needs to find another one before she goes on a trip to Japan.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.160]   But what my wife has done is help me update my classic book How to Engineer Your Layoff,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.040]   Make a Small Fortune by Saying Goodbye that I first wrote in 2012. It's now on its sixth edition.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:24.880]   It has 50 more pages of strategy. It talks about life and work post-pandemic and it is the number
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.960]   one source for helping you negotiate a severance for yourself so you can be free. Just know that
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.480]   soon after you leave your job you will be replaced. Your old bosses and colleagues will forget all
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.320]   about you. Well maybe not instantly but within about a month or two months you're going to be
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.520]   old news folks and another one is just going to next person up going to take your place and do
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:57.360]   your job. So please don't get married to your job. Think about it more as a transaction as a way
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.640]   to get money, to save money, to invest more money so you can one day be free. Now if you love your
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:12.400]   job, awesome. However the reality is only about 30% of folks are engaged at work. A full 70%
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:20.000]   not engaged or dislike their jobs. And the longer you do your job, well the less interested you will
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.160]   be in your job. Come on now, think about it. 20 years doing the same thing. I don't care who you
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.080]   are, you're going to get bored kind of going to that amazing conference in Hong Kong or Switzerland
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:39.840]   after the 20th consecutive time. This is why unless you work in an organization that provides
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.440]   a golden parachute, a pension package, you need to figure out a way to negotiate a severance.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.560]   Unlock those golden handcuffs. Today it is exceedingly rare for an employee to remain
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.000]   with one firm for their entire career and receive a pension upon retirement. The average person
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.400]   changes jobs every three to five years. The average person has three careers in their lifetime. And
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.360]   each time they change jobs presents an opportunity to negotiate a severance package. Given the
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.680]   transactional nature of work, the nature of a severance negotiation implies that an exiting
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.160]   employee provides value in lieu of receiving a severance. This value can be in the form of
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.840]   cost savings, right? No longer do they have to pay you 500,000 or 200,000, they can hire a cheap
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:37.040]   replacement. Or you can train your replacement for as long as possible to provide a smooth
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.480]   transition. You can tell your employer, look, I'm getting out of the industry and I don't want to go
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:50.080]   to a competitor, so don't worry. And you can say, I also agree not to air any dirty company secrets
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.560]   or say anything bad about you, my manager. The last thing a company wants is a disgruntled
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.360]   employee writing a tell-all article in a major publication about shady things that were going
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.720]   on inside the firm. Reputation matters most. It can take a hundred years to build and a minute
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.800]   to destroy, especially now, thanks to social media and the internet. Recently, we've seen tons of
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.720]   mass layoffs from large tech organizations. How do they lay them off? They lock their employees out
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.880]   one day at 3am and they send a mass email. There's not a lot of empathy that goes into laying
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:36.720]   employees off nowadays, folks. Laying people off is difficult. It's emotionally taxing. So if you
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.640]   can think more like a manager, if you can think about your manager, ironically, and help with the
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.720]   layoff process, it's likely easier to get a better severance package. And I talk about this in my
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.520]   book, How to Engineer Your Layoff. Please don't get too emotionally attached to your job. I've
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.080]   been out of the workforce since 2012, right? So that's like 11 years. And the people who are most
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.320]   depressed after work, after early retirement, fake retirement, sabbatical, are the people who got way
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   wrapped up in their jobs. Their identity was their job. They love to tell everybody, "I am the vice
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:20.240]   president of procurement, of marketing, of business development. I just got a raise and a promotion.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.320]   I am the big kahuna, LinkedIn profile, update, update, update." You know, these people, man,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.560]   they suffered the most once they no longer had their jobs, their title, their positions,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:39.280]   that steady cash flow. Be careful. Be careful. Find other outlets, whether it's through friends,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.720]   families, hobbies, side hustles. And for me, I found an outlet through writing, and now I like
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.120]   to podcast. And now there's tennis and pickleball, right? Fine. Diversify your interest, folks.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.160]   Don't go all in on your employer. Because in this hyper competitive world, you could find yourself
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:03.040]   jobless the very next month. I hope you don't. If you need that job, just know, things are as
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.920]   precarious as ever. So maybe the FIRE movement is going to stay long term. Because FIRE,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.080]   Financial Independence Retire Early, really is about saving and investing as much money as
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.000]   possible. So you could have as much passive income as possible to cover your basic living expenses.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.920]   So you can do more of what you want to have options to live the life that you want. So maybe
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.120]   I was premature about saying FIRE is becoming obsolete, because work is becoming more flexible.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.080]   I myself am considering going back to work. I think being a teacher, I think in Hawaii,
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.120]   at a couple schools that I'd like my kids to go to, sounds like a good idea. I could be a teacher
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:50.400]   in writing, in media, business, finance, or tennis again. I did teach high school tennis. I was a
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.560]   high school tennis coach for three years. And that was pretty rewarding and pretty fun. But that is
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.400]   the power of FIRE, because these jobs aren't going to pay me a lot. But at least I have the investments
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:07.440]   to help provide for my family. One final point, and it's on cognitive dissonance. And I think it's
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.040]   real among the rich and the powerful. As I've written in the past, no matter how rich you get,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.160]   you often never feel rich or rich enough, because so many people have so much more. It's this
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.960]   constant comparison that creates constant anxiety that's really hard to quell. And so I stumbled
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.720]   across this really fascinating survey. And there's been a number of these surveys in the United
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:40.240]   States about United States real and perceived income gap. Now, less than 0.5% of American
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.000]   households earn more than a million dollars. But the survey participants said they believed
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.120]   about 10% of the US population makes a million dollars. Now a $500,000 income is the threshold,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:00.560]   the cutoff point for a top 1% income. Survey participants believed that roughly 19% of US
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:07.200]   households earn more than $500,000. So based on this survey, I think our perceptions about
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.040]   how much money we have, if we have money is kind of warped, and how much money other people have,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.760]   if we don't have money is kind of warped as well. So the more you know the facts,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.920]   hopefully by listening to this podcast, reading Financial Samurai, reading books, the better you
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   will be. More education, the better. So in conclusion, I hope all employees fight to get
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.840]   the best pay possible. If you do, you'll boost your chances of reaching financial freedom sooner.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   And if you don't, you may end up bitter as you work way longer than you should. The reality is
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.240]   nobody will care more about your finances than you. Loyalty is an excellent trait. It is a
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.320]   Financial Samurai trait. But loyalty also goes both ways. If your CEO is making mega millions
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.800]   while paying you peanuts and talking to you in a condescending manner, you've got to leave.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.840]   Don't spend the best years of your life working for an organization that takes you for granted.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:14.240]   Because if you do, you will look back with regret. And regret is the killer feeling that just grows
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:20.080]   over time. Thanks so much everyone for listening. If you want to pick up the latest copy of How to
