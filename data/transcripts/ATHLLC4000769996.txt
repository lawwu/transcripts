[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.880]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you join me as I try to find all the
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.040]   deals, hacks, and tricks there are.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.760]   And today we're talking about side hustles, ways you can monetize your spare
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.680]   time and hopefully start to build the foundation for some real passive income.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   And we're joined by the chief side hustler himself, Nick Loeber.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.560]   He's the founder of Side Hustle Nation, the host of the Side Hustle Show podcast,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.640]   and has quite a few side hustles under his belt, including self-publishing a
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840]   book, flipping products on eBay, and starting multiple online businesses.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.200]   In our conversation, we'll talk about easy side hustles to get started with, how to
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.640]   think about bigger opportunities that could replace your job, and how to come
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   up with your next business idea.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.160]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.600]   Nick, thanks for being here.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   What is going on, man?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   Happy to be here.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.800]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.040]   I want to jump right into how you became the side hustle guy.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   I became the side hustle guy by coming out of a low point, like a soul-searching
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.360]   low point of what do I want to do?
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.520]   What do I want to be known for?
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280]   What do I want people to find when somebody Googles you?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000]   And you kind of go through all of these business startup questions that I have
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760]   posed to my audience hundreds of times.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.120]   Like, what do you never get tired about talking about?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   You know, what lights you up?
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   What do people come to you for advice for?
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.000]   But it was kind of going through a low point and, you know, I'd started a bunch
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.520]   of other projects on the side and was looking for the next thing.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.680]   And this idea of a lower risk brand of entrepreneurship, because that was my
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.520]   background look, start something low risk, started on the side, build it up as you
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.360]   have time and deconstructing, like, where does the money come from?
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   Deconstructing business ideas and business models was and still is fascinating to me.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.400]   And with that, I rebranded my long running personal blog that nobody ever read.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.640]   Rebranded NickLoper.com, DecideHustleNation.com in kind of spring
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.280]   2013 and fired up the old podcast mic and started asking other people questions.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.960]   And it's been an incredible journey since then.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.800]   Yeah, you've done hundreds of episodes, talked to so many people.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.160]   I guess I just want to start off so people understand one of the cool things you said,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.640]   you know, and me coming from a background where starting an entrepreneurial endeavor
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.840]   in Silicon Valley can often be something that takes millions of dollars and you hire
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.640]   lots of people.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.520]   How do you tell people what a side hustle is as opposed to other entrepreneurial
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   endeavors?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.160]   And that's a good point because that was kind of the narrative that I was hearing.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.280]   An entrepreneur is somebody who raises venture capital, eventually takes this
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.960]   company public like they want to go big.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.680]   And I was like, well, there's this other flavor, this like lifestyle entrepreneur
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.840]   who, you know, maybe they don't even ever want to quit their job, but they still want
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.120]   to, you know, use their free time more effectively, more productively.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.760]   Maybe they want to, you know, scratch this creative itch on the side.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.160]   But yeah, so side hustle broadly defined anything that you're doing outside of
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.400]   traditional job to make extra money ranging from bartending, delivering pizzas,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.600]   driving Uber, all the way up to, you know, starting a company, starting a business.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.120]   I will say there is more of an entrepreneurial connotation to it rather than just
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.280]   taking on a second job.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.720]   So generations ago, this might've been known as moonlighting, but today it's more
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.000]   like, okay, this is my side hustle.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.760]   This is something that maybe long-term has the potential to be a little more time
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.440]   leveraged.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   It could be something that maybe replaces that day job income if you want it to.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.480]   There's this positive upside connotation that doesn't necessarily come with that
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   second job.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.560]   And was there a, an original side hustle that got this all started for you?
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.960]   It was called shoesniper.com and its latest iteration.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.080]   I don't think it exists anymore because it's been shut down for several years, but
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   this would pull in the product catalogs from Zappos, Amazon, all these other footwear
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.560]   retailers, and it would spit back out where you could find the best price on your next
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.160]   pair of shoes.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.640]   This was, you know, in the early days of the internet, some of your listeners might
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.000]   be young enough to remember, like comparison shopping was a thing back in the day before
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   everyone just went to Amazon by default.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.640]   It was like, oh, there are several stores that sell this thing that I want.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.160]   And so the big idea for me was, well, what if instead of trying to compare every
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.640]   product under the sun, like, what if we focused on this one niche and we did it
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   better than everybody else by, you know, having product level integrations and tighter
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.520]   kind of like comparison algorithms and more accurate algorithms.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.960]   And that was the thing that was, I kind of naively thought I could be the shoe guy.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.920]   Like, that's just this, I just, I'm the dude who sells shoes on the internet.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.480]   But that was the thing that let me quit my job after three years of nights and weekends,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.440]   like try to hustle that thing to the point of sustainability.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.840]   I don't even think it had replaced my day job salary by the time it was.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.920]   It was time to quit, but it had at least it was at least covering my monthly expenses.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   And I could see with an extra 40, 50 hours a week to dedicate to it, how you'd get to
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.400]   that level and beyond.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.520]   And at that point, had you figured out that this whole space was where you wanted to
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.800]   spend time, you had a side hustle, it turned into a full time thing, and then side
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.400]   hustles became your side hustle?
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.080]   It did. That was like five years later.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.720]   So I quit my job, started the shoe operation like in '05, quit my job in '08, started
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.400]   Side Hustle Nation in 2013.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.440]   So it's just, you know, had a few years of entrepreneurial experience.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.920]   I called it retired at 25, but it turned out to be anything but a retirement.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.360]   It was like, I'm still working all the time.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.600]   There's a lot of maintenance required.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.720]   Like shoes is very seasonal, like constantly turning over inventory and stuff.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.240]   So there's a lot of upkeep involved in that.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.480]   But it was still a pretty fun operation to try and optimize all of the inventory and
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.920]   ad listings and the conversion rates on the page and stuff.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.600]   It was a cool, it was definitely a cool first business.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.880]   Yeah. And so that was your first one.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.920]   When you talk to people who are probably most often working a full time job and
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.400]   they're thinking, wow, I could generate some side income, I could pursue some
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.760]   passions. Are there things you advise them to do to get started?
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   The passion question is an interesting one, and maybe we could start there.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.480]   Because Nick Huber, who runs a podcast called Sweaty Startup, was on the Side
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680]   Hustle show last year.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.720]   And he said, Nick, under no circumstance should you start a business around your
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.080]   passion? I was like, well, why not?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   You know, that seems like reasonable advice.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   He's like, look, if you're passionate about it, other people probably are too,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   right? Yoga, craft beer, whatever it is.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.920]   The world doesn't care about your passion necessarily.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.520]   And when people are passionate about things, they behave irrationally.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.760]   Like they work for free.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.800]   It's like, no, no, no. Under no circumstance, start a business around your
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   passion. Start a business around solving a problem instead.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.520]   And bonus points if it's a problem that you're at least somewhat interested in or
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.520]   excited about.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   And then, because I found that passion tends to follow doing the work.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.040]   Like in college, I was painting houses as like my college job, my college side
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.280]   hustle, and I had no passion for painting houses.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.880]   But by the end of a couple of summers of doing this, you couldn't help but walking
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.600]   through a neighborhood and looking up under the eaves and like, oh, there's a
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.640]   paint job waiting to happen.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.040]   I'll scrape that, I better make a note, come give these guys an estimate on the
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.280]   weekend. It came from doing the work, it came from embedding yourself in that
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.680]   space. And same thing with podcasting.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   I had no passion for podcasting.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.160]   When I got started, it would have been impossible to.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.000]   I didn't know what I was doing, how it all worked.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.720]   But over the course of now eight years of doing it and 450 episodes of the side
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.160]   hustle show, it's become a part of my identity.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.800]   It's definitely become a huge passion of mine.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.520]   Yeah, well, I'm not sure I took that advice because this entire podcast was I'm
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.040]   passionate about finding all the deals, all the hacks, and I turned that into a
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   project. But for me, I guess it doesn't make a lot of money.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So it's not a it's not a side hustle yet.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.400]   It's more of just an outlet for creativity.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.440]   Well, I like that. I like that approach, too, though.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.400]   It's like, here's something that I'm curious about.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   Here's something that I'm interested in.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.960]   And here's a unique medium to to go out and explore that.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.520]   Right. Because that is kind of the second part of the equation.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.000]   OK, what's what's the problem in my life?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   I need more hacks. And then the second part is like, well, how do I go find them?
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.160]   I'm going to go. I'm going to go talk to people.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.680]   Yeah. And one of the reasons when I talk to all of our listeners about why they're
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.280]   really excited about a lot of different hacks is that they end up saving money.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.200]   They save time. It allows them to go travel places.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   So I think one of the coolest things about side hustles is allows you to generate
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.680]   that extra income. And you have a challenge I saw on your site, a five day, five
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.760]   hundred dollar challenge. I assume the premise is that anyone can get started
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.520]   doing this and make some extra money in a short period of time.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.760]   Are there specific types of side hustles that are easy to get started for a
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.960]   beginner to make a little bit of extra cash?
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.320]   Yes, absolutely. So at the very low end of the spectrum, like, what can I do to
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.240]   kind of just toe dip into the side hustle world?
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.840]   Right. So this is like credit card rewards.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.760]   Like you're the expert on this stuff.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.800]   This is like cashback apps.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.200]   This is just no brainer stuff to add to your phone.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.800]   These are online market research studies.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.680]   I just did one last week where I got paid 50 bucks in Amazon credit to talk about
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.800]   my video editing process. I was like, this is anybody can go do this stuff.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.120]   Where are you finding them?
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.600]   What are there? Is there a list of them on your site?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.640]   And do you have ones that you recommend checking out when it comes to some of
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   these market research things?
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.840]   My top two are userinterviews.com and respondent.io.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.640]   But the advantage that both of these have over like a swag box or something is that
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.760]   they like they are looking for industry professionals and will usually pay for
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.280]   that expertise, you know, 50, 100, 150, 200 bucks an hour versus, you know, three
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.160]   to three dollars an hour or whatever the equivalent would be just like doing these
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.520]   kind of brainless little surveys while you're watching TV.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.800]   So a little bit more involved, but, you know, from the comfort of your home, I've
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.520]   done a handful of these different studies and I find that stuff interesting.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.600]   And it's like, well, shoot, if I can qualify for it, somebody else with more
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.000]   professional credentials could probably qualify for even more of these.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.120]   Those would be kind of low hanging fruit stuff.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.920]   On the product side, we see people just getting involved in the eBay or Facebook
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.640]   marketplace game where it's, you know, start by clearing out your garage,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.320]   clearing out your attic, you know, what is all this stuff that's collecting
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.800]   dust where it could be collecting dollars.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.080]   And then we see people kind of taking that to the next level where, you know,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.160]   it would be sourcing at garage sales, yard sales, estate sales, Craigslist.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.240]   We've even seen people going like from the free section of Craigslist
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   onto Facebook marketplace.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600]   There's like this weird arbitrage thing that's going on right now.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.040]   But those would be kind of the very low hanging fruit type of side hustles
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.840]   without getting into the freelancing or consulting or like selling a service
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.920]   type of operation, which probably be the next level up.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.440]   And of course, another one to consider is just all of the gig economy apps.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.920]   Maybe your long-term upside potential isn't really strong with a DoorDash or
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.320]   an Uber Eats or something like that.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.800]   But if you need to make money in the near term, like it's hard to beat this
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.840]   kind of plug and play functionality that they've built.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.040]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.840]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.960]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.920]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.960]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.160]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.520]   37,000.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.040]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.400]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.960]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.280]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   25.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.640]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.480]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.200]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.800]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.400]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.240]   system with one source of truth.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.200]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.560]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.360]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.160]   consistently excellent performance, absolutely free at allthehacks.com/netsuite.

[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.360]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.520]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.240]   is actually so good for you.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.000]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.880]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.960]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.400]   250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.640]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.520]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.680]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.000]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.280]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.000]   Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.120]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.760]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.800]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.200]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.520]   happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   world, but you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.320]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:11.120]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.200]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.760]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.360]   And do you have a metric for how you compare these in your mind?
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.040]   Is it dollars per hour?
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.720]   Is it things you can do in small blocks of time?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   How do you think about that?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.040]   So think about dollars per hour is a good kind of baseline metric, but it can be
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.520]   misleading because you're like, Oh, I made 50 bucks an hour, but you can't, you
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.680]   couldn't do that eight hours a day.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.440]   You know, it's like, well, the opportunity came up and I made my 50 bucks and then
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.600]   it was kind of gone and the same thing with Instacart.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.200]   Like if you're, you know, cranking out Instacart orders and it's like, Oh,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.160]   you know, you may have spurts where you're making 25, 30 an hour and you're
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.120]   like, this is great.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.000]   And then you might have hit kind of this drive spell where you're like, uh, you
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.280]   know, maybe I'm making 10, 15, I got to pay for gas on top of this.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.160]   So there's this natural downward pressure and any of these like driving related
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.600]   services is a natural downward pressure on price because it's a skill that almost
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   everybody has, you know, it's like, uh, there's only, there's only so much you
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.160]   can do to, uh, to differentiate yourself there.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.520]   But I do like the hourly rate metric.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.960]   I do like kind of thinking of how can I, what can I do to fit into the gaps in my
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.440]   day?
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.640]   Even we have people on the podcast, like building online businesses, building
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.800]   these blog empires with a couple young kids at home.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.560]   I'm like, how are you getting this done?
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.280]   And she described like the cracks in her day.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.440]   And I was like, Oh, I really liked that metaphor where it's like, you know, the
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.600]   nap time here or the, you know, play group over here, you're, you know, you're
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   responding to emails.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.480]   I don't know.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.480]   There's, there's always ways to get it done.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.120]   If that makes sense.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.920]   Are there good side hustles for those 15 minute gaps?
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.240]   Obviously you're not going to hop in the car and drive to the grocery store and do
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.760]   some Instacart shopping with a 15, 20 minute gap.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.120]   But are there things that you've seen that work really well for people who only have
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   small blips of time, but maybe you could stack them over the course of a few days?
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.280]   Yeah, that's a challenging one where I might go with that.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.840]   One that my wife is involved in is just print on demand.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.920]   And so she has t-shirts on Redbubble and Merch by Amazon.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.800]   And I want to say a couple other places, but you know, with a 15 minute gap, she
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.040]   could probably design a t-shirt or at least kind of get a template design and
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.200]   she was in front of her computer.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.040]   So that's kind of one way to go.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.480]   And then there's some like uploading time related to that.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   And what's cool there is once it's created Amazon or Redbubble or these other
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.600]   marketplaces are handling all the shipping and fulfillment, you set your own price.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.280]   You're just making a little margin on top of that.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.080]   And it's like, OK, it's not a huge moneymaker, but she had like some Father's
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.560]   Day related one that just recently sold.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.960]   And she's like, yes, you know, get a little sale notification.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.560]   It's just, you know, it's play money.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.440]   But if you took it seriously and you were consistent about creating that type of
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.120]   stuff, it can definitely add up.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.040]   And same thing with the online business.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.720]   If you are going to commit to writing a book, I want to go the self-publish
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.000]   route, if you want to start this blog or online based business, you have 15
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.480]   minute gaps, which it's easy to dismiss and say, I've only got 15 minutes.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.240]   What am I going to get done?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.400]   If you sat down and use those 15 minutes to outline content or to draft your next
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.280]   email or to start creating this blog post, you kind of start chipping away at it.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.920]   And I find that momentum tends to build a little bit.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.560]   And I've definitely found that when tackling really, really long articles and
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.760]   blog posts, like one of the things I think put Side Hustle Nation on the map in its
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.440]   earlier days was like these mega list posts where it's 5,000 words and it has all
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:55.960]   these ideas.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.000]   But some of these, I've got 40 hours into some of these posts, but the only way to
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.880]   tackle it was kind of like, okay, one step at a time in the, in the gaps that are
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.240]   allowed.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.760]   Yeah, it's funny you say this.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.480]   So I have tried to start a blog for, I don't know, almost a decade.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.280]   And I I've always gotten like a one post in and then realized that I'm not going to
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.160]   keep doing this.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.640]   But I also realized like that one post could be valuable.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:25.240]   Is there a way for someone who's not ready to commit to blogging full time, but
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.680]   might have something interesting that they want to put together or something?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.520]   Is there an easy way to do that on like a one or two post basis without starting a
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:32.960]   blog?
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.440]   Yeah, I would just put it up on Medium, put it up on LinkedIn versus going through
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.200]   the trouble of setting up your own domain and hosting, and then it goes stale and
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.680]   then the domain expires and all that stuff.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.440]   So I would just go to some of these writing marketplaces as they were.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.680]   Cool.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.840]   And I want to go back to the, the side hustle your wife has.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.880]   Was it t-shirts or what kind of things is she designing?
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.280]   Yeah, she's made t-shirts, she's made the socks, she's made mugs, I think she made
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.840]   stickers, like I think she sold a crapload of Eclipse stickers.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   What was that like 2017, 2018, whenever that big Eclipse was going on, she had a
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.880]   great month and we were like, we just need another Eclipse to come along.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.720]   I got to wait another 37 years or whatever it was.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.000]   How does that work?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.080]   So I actually, for our anniversary this year, I got my wife this funny t-shirt on
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.800]   Amazon that just said Epic Wife since 2012.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.480]   I couldn't help but think, how is this happening?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.920]   Like, are these even designed?
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.640]   Did someone just make a logo and as soon as I order it, it gets printed?
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.320]   Is that something that if you had a idea for a funny mug or a cool sticker, like
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   you obviously don't have to go buy a printing press or anything like that.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.280]   How does that hustle work?
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.160]   Right.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.520]   It's all print on demand.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.880]   So no, no screen printing machine in your basement or anything like that.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.840]   You upload this digital file.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.440]   So you create some clever saying, most of these are like just text based.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.080]   So not, you know, no crazy artistry required.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.720]   Upload that digital file to Amazon.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.120]   Set your price, set what kind of colors, t-shirts you want it to be on.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.800]   And they have a whole lot of other products now as well.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.240]   And then when somebody orders it, it's all, it's completely hands off.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.280]   And then it just shows up in your report as royalties earned.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.760]   When we first got started on this, it was like right around Trump's inauguration.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.240]   So the meme of the day was alternative facts.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.080]   You know, the, I forget who it was, like the press secretary was like, Oh, the
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.040]   president presented an alternative fact.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.640]   And we were like, that's just an alternative fact.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   It's like such an interesting way to phrase it.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.320]   And so we made like, I went to the gym today, hashtag alternative facts or
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.280]   something, it's, it's kind of a creative outlet and it doesn't take a ton of time
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.360]   to create, like the people who are doing really, really well at it have thousands
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.840]   and thousands of designs where it becomes very much a volume game.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.720]   And of course there's an 80/20 distribution to everything that sells,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.840]   but you know, for one-off stuff, it can be fun.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.880]   And she's, and she's done custom stuff for, for family and friends too.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.800]   Like, cause now, you know, other people know that she's into it.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.920]   Like our buddy's going to his golf tournament.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.320]   Hey, would you put, would you put this picture on a shirt?
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.360]   It was just like his buddy like passed out or something.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.600]   I don't know.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.320]   And they just, she listed it on Amazon.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   And he, you know, he may be the only person who ever buys it, but it's just
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.800]   like, yeah, I'll make you a custom shirt.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.520]   It's kind of a fun like distribution center to have in your backyard, basically
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.240]   where, you know, it's all prime eligible and pretty affordable because I don't
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.800]   know how they're making money on it, but very, uh, it's pretty cool.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.720]   So the shirt I got was less than $20 for a shirt that I, I, now that I think
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.440]   about it, I noticed there are a bunch of styles of the same kind of shirt.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.520]   And I'm wondering if it was just someone uploaded 10 different
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.720]   designs of the same shirt.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.480]   Uh, yeah, we would be remiss if we didn't mention like once something
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.800]   sells the software and the bots kind of come out and say, Oh, this is a hot
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.120]   seller.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   Let's make a copycat.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Let's make a duplicate of it because there's so little barrier to entry.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.040]   It becomes kind of like, well, I got to keep coming up with the next design
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.160]   rather than fighting copyright trolls and stuff.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.040]   Yep.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.160]   You mentioned another side hustle about, you know, delivery.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.120]   And one of the challenges is it's such a low barrier to entry.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.640]   Are there any skills that, you know, taking a quick course or getting
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   registered to do something kind of unlocks some side hustle income?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.080]   I know when we purchased our home, I talked to the person who came to our
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.520]   house to do our notarizing for the home purchase said that this was their
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.720]   little side hustle, you know, a couple, couple of days a week they do evening,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.840]   evening, things like that.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.160]   I have no idea how hard it is to become a notary.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.240]   I don't know if that's a good one, but are there things like that, that can
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.880]   generate income that have a little bit higher barrier to entry that might make
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.080]   the sustainability of making more money higher?
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.600]   The notary one is actually a perfect example.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.280]   That's one of the most, I don't know, I don't know why I say surprising,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.120]   but out of all of the episodes that we've done, the one that I get an
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.040]   outsized feedback response to is on this mobile notary side hustle, because it's
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.080]   not, it's not zero, but there's, there's a little bit of startup costs in terms
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   of education, equipment, and certification, but like, you know, maybe
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.160]   you're a thousand bucks and then you're going out and making a hundred
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.000]   bucks for every signing appointment.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.800]   We've seen people, especially with this low interest rate environment and all
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.120]   the refinancing that's going on, seeing people making eight, nine, 10 grand a
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.200]   month doing this and on the side, it might be a full-time gig at that point
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.280]   for them, but like, if you're just doing it on the side, like, you know, a
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.760]   thousand bucks, 2000 bucks a month.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.360]   It doesn't seem unreasonable, especially since, you know, it's a good gig for
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.760]   nights and weekends because the people presumably signing mortgage documents
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.440]   have jobs, that's what like the bank wants to see to lend you money and, you
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.520]   know, they're working during the day, but they're available to sign evenings
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.280]   and weekends and it works out really well.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.320]   We've got a couple episodes.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.640]   I can send you the links.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.800]   Yeah, I'll put, I'll put links to those in the show notes for sure.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.240]   They talk about that, but that's one that stands out.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.360]   We've seen people level up their skills in like web design.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.880]   We had actually one of the most popular episodes of last year was Chris
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.920]   Mistrick from self-made web designer.com.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:04.200]   I think it's his site where he described learning from Code Academy, learning
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.880]   from free resources online, starting actually locally, selling the skill,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.760]   going on Upwork, bidding on jobs and continuing to double his rates until he
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.000]   started to get pushback or had a harder time getting clients.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.920]   But it was like, you know, I don't know.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.160]   I thought that was a cool example of like learning an in-demand skill, even
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.040]   in what would seem to be, you know, with the rise of Squarespace and Wix.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.400]   And we were like, it's not that hard to design a website anymore, but plenty
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.840]   of people still willing to pay for it because the pie just keeps getting
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.880]   bigger, people who presumably need websites.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.360]   He was able to do really well with that.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.680]   We had another gal who had, I don't know if she had a particular background in
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.480]   finance, but she kind of studied up on like the QuickBooks certification and
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   kind of these other like online accounting programs and was like, I'll
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.000]   become your remote bookkeeper, which I thought was an interesting one.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.760]   And she was doing, you know, 50, 70 bucks an hour equivalent, you know,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   from home, uh, doing, doing books.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.480]   And like, if you like math and numbers and I don't know that kind of appealed
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:11.080]   to me, and then recently this was more of a career change, but I thought, I
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.160]   think the model was illustrative of kind of a broader opportunity.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.960]   So we have Brad Rice and his argument was Salesforce as a software company
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.640]   has grown its customer base far faster than it's been able to grow its
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   ecosystem of qualified service providers, consultants, freelancers
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.400]   to serve that customer base.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.400]   And he's like, and because of that, there is such an in-demand industry.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.440]   And he's like, you know, it's, it's rare to go from not being part of this
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   ecosystem to being like freelancer, uh, you know, solo remote freelancer
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.320]   consultant type of person, but you know, with two, three, four years under your
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.400]   belt, like that's a very common career path.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.040]   And he said he was making 200 grand last year, working 20 hours a week or
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.880]   something, it's like, yeah, sign me up.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.600]   You know, it sounds pretty good.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   But the way we framed that on the side, also show was software with a service,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.960]   like hitching your cart to a popular software product, maybe it's QuickBooks,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.680]   maybe it's Salesforce, maybe it's Asana, maybe it's monday.com, maybe it's, uh,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.520]   air table, you know, all these, you have this, all these kinds of software
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.720]   and there's always more coming out.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.840]   They have their own little, uh, ecosystem of customers.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.080]   And if you can kind of become a go-to player, uh, in that space, like we had
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.480]   on the podcast, Paul Miners out of New Zealand, where he would just create
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.360]   these, uh, he was kind of early adopter in Asana, he'd create these little
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.040]   short videos for YouTube to say like how to do blank in Asana.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   And he just introduced that like, Hey, I'm Paul.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   I'm a, I'm a, an Asana consultant and here's how to do blah, blah, blah in Asana.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.280]   And he was booking like thousands of dollars worth of consulting gigs
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.760]   because, you know, companies were like, that's great.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.240]   Could you come in and train our team?
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.960]   Could you come in and just help us, uh, implement these systems?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.440]   So software with a service is one of these, uh, side hustle models that I
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.560]   think really has some potential, uh, to scale and drive some higher hours per
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.200]   dollar rates.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.320]   I would say to anyone listening, if there's a piece of software or even a, an
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.480]   activity that you feel like you've mastered, there's probably a marketplace
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.120]   for you to turn that into a business.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.720]   I know I always tell people, Oh yeah, I, I hang, uh, TVs.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.920]   Whenever we bought a new TV, I went through the effort to learn how to
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.080]   find, you know, mounted to the studs properly and, and do everything.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.240]   And other people I know hire someone to do that.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.160]   I don't know if there's a good, uh, marketplace for that, but if there's a
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.640]   thing that you've learned how to master and set up and do other people pay for
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   those things and you can find marketplace for that.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.880]   Is there a place for in-person things?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.400]   Like, is there an easy marketplace for me to put myself out there as someone
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.840]   who can tune up someone's bicycle?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.200]   I'd probably look at.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.320]   TaskRabbit or Thumbtack for something like that, especially for the home
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.040]   services, even next door might be worth a look there.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.960]   Cool.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.600]   I mean, I know when we launched this podcast, I wanted to have show notes
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.520]   and, uh, I found this amazing woman in Canada on Fiverr who helps me write all
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.800]   the show notes and finds all the links for everything.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.840]   I know there are a lot of things on Fiverr.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.160]   If you have a microphone, people will pay as we did for the disclosure in some of
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.400]   our episodes for someone to just record a disclosure.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.000]   And if you have a good voice and you have a microphone, you might be
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.560]   able to do that work in a minute.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.680]   Um, so that's another interesting one online where I've found at least on the,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.000]   on the, you know, buyer side, I found a lot of tasks and projects that I wanted
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.680]   to accomplish, even something as simple as we, we upgraded our wireless system
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.760]   in our house and we use unify, which is a ubiquity product, which is kind
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.920]   of designed for the enterprise.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.200]   And so the way you set it up is just more complicated than other things.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.560]   And I thought I have two options.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.800]   I could go learn everything about this and watch all the YouTube videos, or I
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.600]   could find someone who does this for a living and remotely could walk me through
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.520]   the settings and I could pay them, you know, 25, 30, 40, 50 bucks to spend an
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.400]   hour and just walk through everything so I can get it completely done and save
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.560]   myself the five, 10 hours of reading every possible thing about how to set it up.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   And so even if you've just learned how to use a particular tool that doesn't
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.640]   even feel like an enterprise system, like Salesforce, you might still be able to
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.400]   market yourself as an expert, helping someone set things up or, you know, build
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.280]   a, a well-designed presentation and keynote or PowerPoint.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.040]   I know there's, uh, definitely a market for presentation design also.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.360]   All of those, all of those things, Fiverr is a fascinating platform where there's
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.680]   always room for new entry points because the top rated people naturally
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.680]   get busy and flooded with orders.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.920]   And so you go and you want to book this person cause they've got, you
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.400]   know, a thousand five-star reviews.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.560]   And they're like, well, I'm like booked three weeks out.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.720]   And so then you're like, well, okay, well back to the drawing board.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.240]   Like, okay, I'm going to take my chance with this guy with fewer reviews.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.040]   So that's one way to go there.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.640]   Oh, the other thing on that, like if you have a problem that you've overcome,
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.280]   that you've, you've like solved this problem in your own life, record
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.920]   the YouTube video about it.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.960]   I don't care like how boring it is.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   It could just be like a screen recording video.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.160]   The reason is like these tend to, if, if, if it was a problem in your life, other
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.480]   people are looking for how to do it as well.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:32.840]   I had videos on like how to download high resolution images from Instagram.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.360]   It had like 9,000 views before they changed the interface.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.960]   And my little trick didn't work anymore.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.000]   How to create a folder in Gmail.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.080]   I think that's still up there.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.360]   It still generates views, generates ad revenue every month.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.520]   How to, uh, how to stop Dropbox from like taking up your local hard drive
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.280]   storage or something.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.800]   It was like this little unsync checkbox and still generating views and ad
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.640]   revenue every month.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.440]   So, uh, think of these little like mini digital assets that you can create and
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.520]   you, you have to build a certain subscriber base before you can get
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   monetized on YouTube.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.880]   But if you create enough of these, like just, you know, one of them is bound
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.280]   to, to hit after a while.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.320]   It's just kind of like found money.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.360]   It feels like the most passive income in the world to me.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.960]   And do you, you said you have to have a certain subscriber base.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.400]   Can, can anyone not create a YouTube video and start to monetize?
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.040]   How does that work?
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   Your channel needs to have, I want to say a thousand subscribers and maybe 4,000
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.680]   hours of total watch time.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.400]   And then they'll let you turn on monetization.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.800]   And then they'll let you turn on the ads.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.200]   And, and if you had made a couple of those videos, do you, do those generate
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.240]   subscribers or is that harder to get than, than views?
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.120]   Subscribers are probably harder to get than views.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.800]   So it's, you kind of have to have a concerted effort at producing content.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.400]   But if you have one thing that goes viral, it tends to happen faster than, uh, than
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.560]   you might think, or at least it has, uh, in my case.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.600]   Cool.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.640]   Now you also mentioned passive income, which is an interesting, uh, thing that
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.440]   I'm not sure is passive income a side hustle or is it separate?
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.680]   And how do you think about that?
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.960]   I try to think of it as like time leveraged, right?
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.800]   So the, the, the most passive income that I have is just like, you know, straight
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.920]   up dividend income, like it's going to happen, you know, quarter after quarter,
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.120]   whether or not I do anything, the other income streams like income from the blog
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.480]   and come from the podcast income from YouTube, consider those like kind of more
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.880]   like time leveraged income streams where it's like, okay, it takes the same amount
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.160]   of time to produce this blog post.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.040]   If 10 people read it or 10,000 people read it, it takes the same time to produce this
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.960]   video if nobody watches it or, you know, 10,000 people watch it.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.560]   So think of the time leverage element.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:43.160]   And if you think about your income as a pie chart today, I think it's natural for
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.200]   everyone to start out in their career with a hundred percent of that pie chart being
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.400]   active income, like trading time for money.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.280]   But, you know, if the ultimate goal is, you know, retirement or, you know, where
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.520]   work becomes optional, you kind of need to fill in the rest of that pie chart
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.880]   with passive income or time leveraged income.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.600]   And this is the Warren Buffett thing, like, you know, if you don't find a way to
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.480]   make money in your sleep, you're going to work until you die.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   And it's it's true.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.800]   So what can you do in the near term to kind of like grow that little sliver?
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.400]   You know, maybe it's a little sliver of dividend investments or, you know, savings
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.200]   account interest at point four percent or whatever awful percent it is now.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.840]   One of my favorite examples from the side hustle show in that realm was Matt
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.040]   Bochnock, whose side hustle was repairing motorcycles in his garage, mechanical
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.840]   engineer by day, father of three or four by night and repairing motorcycles in his
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:40.000]   garage in Chicago, like hours for dollars, service based business, add on Craigslist,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.600]   like don't pay dealership rates, bring it to me.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.160]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.920]   What Matt did, which I thought was genius, was setting up the camera in the corner of
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.640]   the garage, films himself doing the repairs.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.680]   So now he's got content for YouTube.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.720]   He starts selling these full engine rebuild videos.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.400]   And fast forward, you know, several years of doing this by investing this little
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.920]   speculative amount of time where he wasn't getting paid to build this time leveraged
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.240]   asset. And over the course of several years, you know, now it's not like not really
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.720]   turning wrenches for dollars anymore.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.160]   Now he's making YouTube ad money, making affiliate income from the products he
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.480]   recommends. He's selling full engine rebuild videos.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.160]   Insurance companies have found his channel and are now paying him to do like, would
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.240]   you make a video for our insurance blog?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:31.560]   I thought that was a really cool example of being proactive about about growing that
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.520]   like time leverage piece of the pie, even even though it was somewhat speculative,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.640]   somewhat risky.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.200]   I may not see any return on this, but over time it definitely ended up paying off.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.920]   And I guess on a broader sense, you could think of, OK, how can I get paid over and
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.840]   over again from from work that I do?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.040]   What's like that's like the ultimate time leverage.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.720]   It doesn't necessarily have to be like, how does this scale?
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.440]   But maybe it is taking a percentage of those earnings, putting them into, you know,
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.280]   blue chip dividends.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.280]   Maybe it is creating that tutorial demo video for YouTube.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.200]   But, you know, it's something that has the potential to reach many, many more people
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.440]   than just whoever you were doing it for originally.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.800]   Yeah, I'll just say sometimes it just takes time, right?
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.680]   You make a video, it might not get found the first week, the first month.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.240]   And but keep in mind that the barrier was low.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.400]   So keep trying.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.040]   I know content sometimes takes a while to catch on.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.400]   You know, as I've been growing this podcast, I've been talking to podcasters and almost
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.280]   everyone I talked to said, you know, the first 10, 20, 30, 40 episodes were so hard.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.720]   I can't remember the percent, but it was like if you can get to 20 episodes in a podcast,
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.360]   you're in the top five percent because most people don't make it that far.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.640]   And so the number one piece of podcast audience growth advice I've gotten is just stay in
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   the game.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.480]   So if you're trying some of these things, recording videos of doing things, don't expect
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.600]   that if you just record a video of how to use a piece of software better, that tomorrow
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.940]   it's going to blow up.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.160]   But over time, it might build to something that could be pretty meaningful.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.320]   And the effort is pretty low to get started.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.360]   Yeah, 100 percent.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.560]   I was just pulling up my active campaign demo video that I did for YouTube.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.240]   This was three summers ago and did pretty much nothing, you know, for the first several
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.080]   months of being out there.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.840]   And even today, now three years later, it's only got 23,000 views, so not huge, you know,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.520]   it's not going viral by any means.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:32.040]   But my active campaign affiliate commissions, I think since that time have been five, $6,000.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.240]   So in creating this asset, you know, it just becomes another, you know, I'd like to think
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.200]   of like creating these digital assets that go out into the world and kind of like do
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.680]   your bidding, like these little minions that come back and bring money back to you.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.760]   And that's definitely been probably one of the more successful examples of that.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.680]   But didn't, like you said, didn't have a ton of viral success or instant success out of
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   the gate.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   But it's just one of these things.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.840]   It just kind of keeps churning along, keeps generating views and revenue every month.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.640]   I know there are some larger side hustles that I'm curious how you think fit into someone's
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   journey.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.160]   Like online courses and books and starting a blog, are those things that people should
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.240]   get their feet wet with side hustles before they start something big?
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.800]   Or is that something you could just start out the gate?
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.320]   I like the process of kind of learning as you go with stuff like that.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   So if you go into that with that expectation of like, I, like you said, I'm podcasting,
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.000]   but I'm not making any money from podcasting, right?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.960]   Like if you need to make money quickly, choose a different path.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.260]   And I do like this path over the long run, because you're going to learn some really
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.360]   interesting skill sets, you're probably going to be networking and meeting really interesting
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.280]   people in your niche.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.720]   And hopefully you're building up an audience and a network of your own.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.760]   I mean, that's been the biggest, you know, speaking of life hacks, one of the biggest
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.280]   ones for me has been starting this podcast and it was, you know, $50 mic, corner of the
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.160]   living room, you know, is this thing on type of stuff early on.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.400]   But you know, that's allowed me to have conversations with so many different people.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:09.000]   That's allowed me to make friends really all over the world that I never really anticipated.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.720]   It was just kind of like, oh, you know, people say if you want to have a personal brand,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   you got to have a podcast.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:19.120]   And it was definitely not monetized or not monetized very well in its early days, but
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.560]   definitely turned into a life changing thing.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:27.200]   So I am definitely pro content creation, blog, podcast, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, whatever
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.280]   your channel of choice may be, but just, you know, if you put in the consistent effort,
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.080]   it tends to either find out that you like it and you don't mind that you're not making
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   any money or you find out that you don't like it and you're like, okay, you know, I'll try
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   something else.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:47.100]   So there's really, and it's so inexpensive to start, you really have a very limited downside
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.200]   on that stuff.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.280]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a great addition
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.640]   to your new year routine and I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.800]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.240]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.720]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft from
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.680]   the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade, sign up for a subscription or
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.600]   try one of their starter packs today.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.180]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it and over
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:34.640]   the past year we've gotten so many great coffees from trade, but this last bag of beans from
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.280]   drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe, it's called bark the moon and it's so delicious.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.480]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:51.280]   Right now, trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:42:01.160]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans, allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.000]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.400]   cooking at home?
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen, but one of his top hacks was using the microwave
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   more.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.240]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.800]   AnyDay, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.600]   AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.960]   microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.560]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:41.080]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.840]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.400]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your AnyDay adventure, I highly recommend
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.960]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.200]   It is so good.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo collection they launched last year, you
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.440]   have to check it out.

[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.360]   One, one piece of advice, if anyone out there is thinking of starting a podcast, Ramit Sethi
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.600]   gave me the advice that when you start a podcast, you could always just say you're going to,
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.660]   you know, have season one and not have season two.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.520]   So you could have an eight episode season one and not feel like you've necessarily committed.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.200]   So when I was first getting going, I was like, you know what, maybe I'll just say I'm going
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.120]   to launch one season with eight episodes and see what happens.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.960]   And by the time I'd recorded the third episode, I was like, I love doing this.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.280]   I'm not going to stop at eight, so I don't need to create that structure.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.360]   But anytime you're doing stuff like this, you can always set it up so that it's okay
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.200]   that it's not a forever thing.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:16.360]   I met the host of the Sleep With Me podcast, he goes by Scooter on the podcast, I forget
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:22.160]   his name in real life, and it's a boring bedtime story podcast, not a sex podcast.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.960]   It's like, you know, plug this in as you're going to sleep, he'll tell you a super boring
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.080]   story and eventually you'll fall asleep.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.680]   But what he told me he did was set quit dates.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.280]   So if I am going to put this, you know, arbitrary date on my calendar, three months out, six
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.960]   months out, and I'm not going to think twice about doing my thing, practicing my craft
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   until that date.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.120]   When that day comes, I'm going to re-evaluate, say like, is this something that I want to
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   keep doing?
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   Yes or no.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.560]   And that eliminated the day-to-day doubt that can creep in like, is this worth it?
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.880]   Do I really want to do this today?
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.600]   It's like, nope, it's not quit date yet, so let's keep at it.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   I like that.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.720]   So we talked about some of these smaller things, creating some content, we talked about, you
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.400]   know, some of the things like driving for Lyft or Uber, maybe even becoming a notary,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.880]   things that you can do in your spare time.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.080]   When people start to think about this, eventually a side hustle kind of becomes something that
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.720]   could be bigger.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.240]   And I know some of these different side hustles that you talk about when you interview guests
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.320]   on your show, they're bigger endeavors.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.200]   How do you think people should think about bigger side hustles and things that could
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.920]   actually become full-time jobs?
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:41.200]   So one of the things I think is important to think about from the early days is, okay,
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.360]   you know, aside from just like the dabbling stuff that we talked about, but like, if you're
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.920]   like, okay, this is a business, this is something that I really want to pursue, is trying to
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.240]   find somebody, you know, three, four, five years down the road, what does their life
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   look like?
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.040]   You know, they hit it, they had success, but you know, what's their day-to-day?
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.800]   And is that a win for you, right?
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.600]   Because the last thing you want to do is pursue this path, like really put your energy into
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   it.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.040]   And then, you know, get to the quote unquote destination and have it be like, ah, yeah,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   this isn't awesome.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.040]   Like, this is not what I wanted.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.720]   So try to think ahead to the extent that you can, like, okay, what does success look like?
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.440]   I don't think I'm the world's greatest entrepreneur, probably in the bottom quartile, actually,
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.160]   like in terms of like scaling and systems and all that stuff.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:32.600]   But if you can figure out a way to remove yourself from the technical delivery of the
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:38.000]   work, and if you can build with that intention, if, you know, if that's your goal, right?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.280]   Because there's, you know, different paths sometimes, like, I just, you know, I love
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.760]   cleaning houses, so that's going to be my thing.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.000]   It may be a difference in mentality from the early days, if instead of saying, I'm a freelance
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.960]   writer, saying like, I run a freelance copy agency or freelance writing agency, instead
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.560]   of like, I walk dogs, I have a dog walking company.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.200]   Oh, we had a woman on the show who was like, started a pooper scooper business.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.360]   But if instead of I'm a pooper scooper, no, I run a pet waste removal business.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.200]   And if you can build that margin and expectation from the clients, like, no, it's not going
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.360]   to be me doing the work, but you know, we're going to have qualified professionals come
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.360]   out and do the work.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:19.020]   If you can set that up from the early days, then you're kind of built to scale and potentially
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.160]   built to sell down the road.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:26.220]   And if you have a business with recurring weekly customers, that can become an attractive
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.560]   acquisition target for other companies too.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.880]   So, a lot of these examples, people had a business.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.400]   Are there ways that you suggest people start to generate ideas for a business that they
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.200]   could start on the side and maybe grow into something bigger?
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.220]   Oh yeah, I love talking business idea frameworks.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220]   How much time do we have?
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.000]   We've got a few of these we could actually run through.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.440]   The first is, so everybody says, like, you know, start with your passions, start with
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   your skills.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.200]   I want to flip that and say, well, okay, that's definitely one option.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.960]   But second option is start with pain points.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.520]   And so normally you try and be a little more of an optimistic person, but like you got
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.920]   to put on your pessimistic hat for this one.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.560]   I call this the what sucks method.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.680]   And this is where you have a, I just kind of do this on like a notes app on my phone.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.340]   Like I'm going through over the course of a day or a week or two weeks, note everything
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.240]   that bothers you, everything that's a pain point in your life, everything that somebody
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.520]   else complains to you about, put it in the what sucks file, because on the flip side
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.160]   of that, there might be a business opportunity.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.320]   And that was Erica with her poop scooping business.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:36.960]   She was out in the backyard, cleaning up after her own dog, thinking like, this kind of sucks,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   but you know what?
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.160]   If it sucks for me, it probably sucks for other people too.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.880]   I wonder if, I wonder if people would pay to get this done.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.120]   So that's kind of the what sucks method, trying to connect pains with what people will pay
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.160]   for like in this problem solving mode.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.000]   Another opportunity is that I like is called the rip pivot and jam method, which comes
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.880]   from Dan and Ian in the tropical MBA podcast.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   This is, you know, step one, rip, find another business that you like, blatantly steal that.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.680]   And then step two, really important, pivot that, you know, pivot that to a different
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   audience, different niche, different industry, whatever it may be, and then jam, go do the
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.880]   work and where like, I implemented this in, in real life, like I was researching a failed
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.600]   side hustle of mine in the wine related niche.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.920]   Like I had no, like, I know nothing about wine, I don't care about wine and no business
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   being there.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.440]   But in the process of researching that site, I came across this website that was reviewing
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.640]   wine clubs and you could kind of punch in what you were looking for.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.960]   And they were like, you know, you could have user reviews down at the bottom.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.560]   And of course, you know, looking back, I think these were kind of like manipulated rankings
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.400]   where they, you know, they wanted the one that paid them the most affiliate commission
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   showed up on top.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.440]   But I was like, well, it's a really cool model.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.880]   What could I pivot that to?
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:58.520]   And kind of combining the, the what sucks method as well was like, one of the pain points
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:04.120]   that I had in growing the shoe business was like, where do I find qualified virtual remote
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.400]   outsourced help?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.680]   How do I know which of these companies are legit operators?
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   How does it work?
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.440]   Is this, uh, do I pay payroll taxes?
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.400]   Like, you know, how I do, it was totally green.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.840]   I didn't know anything about it.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:22.440]   So I pivoted the wine club review site to be a virtual assistant review site and actually
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.100]   ran that for close to 10 years before selling it, uh, at the end of last year.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:31.960]   But that became the first and largest, um, virtual assistant company directory and review
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.840]   platform using that rip pivot and jam method.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.880]   And then the final method that I'll share today is what I'll call like the sniper method,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.520]   which I think works really well for service businesses, for e-commerce type of businesses,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.720]   where if you look at Amazon as a shotgun business, right?
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.720]   We sell everything under the sun and we can have one stop shopping the sniper method or
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.200]   the sniper business idea method is like, well, what if we became the go-to place for a tiny
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.560]   sliver of Amazon's catalog?
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.000]   And it's kind of like how, what the shoe business did, right?
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.440]   Instead of, you know, if price grabber was the shotgun back in that day, like, okay,
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.440]   shoe sniper is going to be like, I only want to focus on footwear and I would pick off
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.120]   that little segment of your business.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.200]   You've probably seen that meme where it's like, you know, here's, here's the screenshot
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.140]   of Craigslist and all of the different startups like that are picking off the different sections
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.140]   of Craigslist.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:28.640]   Like here's Airbnb, here's TaskRabbit, here, all these different little apps that kind
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.440]   of pick off little portions of, uh, of a larger business.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.960]   Could you give an example of one thing that someone could do just to kind of bring that
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.760]   last one to life?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.880]   I see ads for like a general handyman type of service, but where it may be more compelling
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.560]   and maybe easier to carve out space.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.600]   Like, what if you became the go-to person, like you mentioned for flat screen TV mounting?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:56.880]   That was a, that's a great one because I feel like it's a skill that you don't need as much
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.960]   skill as a lot of the people who are doing it have.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.360]   So it probably, you could probably build a directory of people who would install TVs
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.560]   in people's homes for, you know, under 50 bucks.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.080]   But I imagine if you call a home theater company and ask them to come install your TV or a
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.400]   handyman, you might be paying a hundred, 150 bucks.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.200]   So someone out there could go start the directory of people to install TVs on your wall and
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:23.800]   probably take a, you know, a small cut of all the transactions and have a good business.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:30.700]   And in the online world, you see general graphic design firms, we do logos, we do book covers,
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.520]   we do web design, like we do t-shirts, you know, we do all this stuff.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.880]   It's like, okay, what if you could carve out a space?
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.680]   Like, look, we know book covers, you know, we've done all of these book covers.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:47.880]   Look at these bestselling things in our portfolio, like be the go-to spot for that specific need.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.680]   I think that would be an example of using the sniper method.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.280]   And even, you could even say like, we only do, you know, vampire romance, or we only
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.040]   do, you know, self-published, self-help books, or, you know, we only do memoirs, you know,
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.560]   there's even sub-niches in there, which could get even more snipier.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.880]   I mean, one thing that that just made me think about when I think about designing book covers,
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.040]   that's probably something someone does for their day job.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.720]   Obviously, you know, if you're doing something for your day job, you should talk to your
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.480]   employer before getting in any trouble.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.600]   But is turning what you do for your profession at work into freelance work that you could
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.200]   do for other people, something that can be a good side hustle?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.800]   It definitely can be, but like you said, be careful with any sort of non-competes that
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.720]   may be going on, because you wouldn't want to risk your livelihood there.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.520]   We've seen some examples, one was Daniel DiPiazza, he ran a site called Rich 20-something.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.280]   But back in the day, he was like working for Sylvan Learning Center or something, like
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.600]   he was a tutor, and he was making 18 bucks an hour as a tutor.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.960]   And he's like, looking at the pricing on the website, like he knows the parents are paying
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.280]   this company 100 bucks an hour, he's like, there's a lot of margin in there, like what
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.240]   if I could just go direct?
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.200]   And so what he ended up doing was like, I'm going to teach this SAT prep class, and I'm
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.560]   not going to do a one-on-one, I'm going to do it in a group setting.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:11.960]   So he had like all of these people come in, just exploded his hourly rate by going one
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.640]   to many, and cutting out the middleman.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.920]   So it's like, I don't know if Sylvan was too happy about that, but so just make sure, you
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.040]   know, that one lended itself well to that type of model.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.320]   But just make sure, you know, I don't want to get anybody in trouble with their day job.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   Yeah, of course.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.760]   But, you know, if you were a designer during your day job, you could probably do freelance
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.040]   design on the side.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.080]   I wouldn't do it for a company that competes with your primary employer, and I'd get permission,
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:42.320]   but yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunities to spin up freelance work around things that
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   you've done in the past.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.160]   And so one thing I didn't ask is, you know, you keep having all these examples of things
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:54.120]   you've tried, you know, you're a full-time side hustler, I guess now, how do you make
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   a living?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.800]   Is it a stack of 20, 30 different side hustles?
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.160]   Is it one primary thing?
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.880]   How have you turned this into your kind of lifestyle?
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.920]   It is a stack, but most of the stacks are in the same deck and that's the Side Hustle
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   Nation deck.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:16.200]   So the two biggest pieces of the pie right now are sponsorships on the podcast and affiliate
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.120]   revenue through the site in the email list.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.960]   The third leg of the stool historically has been my own side hustle experiments that was
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.720]   like, you know, where the virtual assistant site lived.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.920]   That's where the shoe business lived.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.160]   That's where like the self-publishing and the freelancing and the eBay experiments and
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.080]   like all the other stuff kind of lived in that third leg of the stool.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.360]   That's kind of admittedly a shorter leg of the stool these days.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:44.280]   Outside of just side hustles, you know, you optimize so many things in that regard.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.600]   Are there any favorite life, money, travel hacks you have that you want to share with
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600]   people?
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:55.320]   I mean, one thing that has been immensely helpful, especially with a couple young kids
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.160]   is getting the workout in first thing in the morning.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.960]   And this is like just, you know, 10, 20 minutes, usually like body weight stuff, maybe some
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   kettlebells, maybe some bands.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.280]   But just getting that in, I feel a million times better the rest of the day when I have
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.880]   checked that off first thing in the morning.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.080]   And then just like favorite tools wise, I mean, everybody probably knows about Last
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.760]   Pass, Text Expander.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:25.160]   I was singing the praises of Gmail shortcuts just this morning, like flying through email.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:30.120]   Like if you're not using the R and the K and the J and the control enter to send stuff
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.720]   like you're missing out, like I could process stuff really fast that way.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:38.840]   And then other desktop productivity thing that I use all the time is called ClipX for
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:44.000]   Windows, which is a clipboard manager that lets you be like, we'll bring up like the
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.480]   last 25 things I want to say that you've copied and pasted, because I'm always, I don't know.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.120]   Sometimes it's like, I want the third or fourth thing down on the list, but instead of having
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.160]   to go re-grab it again, you can just use ClipX for that.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:01.360]   And I want to say CopyClip is maybe the Mac equivalent of that, but yeah, lots of different
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   tools.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.040]   I use Alfred on the Mac, which is a replacement for the Spotlight Finder.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.080]   And one of its features is that it stores your clipboard and you can go back and look
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.880]   at different things, even things like if you take a screenshot, all kinds of stuff like
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   that.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.680]   So I don't know what I would do without Alfred on the computer, it would add significant
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   time to my day.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.680]   Cool.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   Well, this was fantastic.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.520]   I feel like if I didn't start this podcast, I'd be ready to go start a few other side
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.360]   hustles, but you know, this is really the side hustle for me right now.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.460]   And I'm excited to use some of these tactics to try to help grow it over the next few months
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.120]   and weeks and hopefully years.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.480]   Any other parting advice?
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:44.640]   I mean, the big thing that I like to say is just think of it as an experiment.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.320]   I mean, life is one big experiment and I don't think side hustles are any different.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.960]   I read somewhere that at any given point, Amazon is testing like a thousand little variables
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.540]   on their website, trying to eke out that next like 0.002 conversion rate.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:02.600]   And I think we can apply the same method to our own life, probably on a smaller scale,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.160]   but say like, what are you experimenting with?
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.320]   What are you testing this month?
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.920]   Like maybe it's, you know, doing the workout first thing in the morning.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.880]   Maybe it is starting that podcast.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.120]   Maybe it's making a YouTube video.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.440]   Maybe it's, you know, what happened if I went vegan?
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.440]   What happened?
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.320]   You know, what would happen if I, you know, quit coffee?
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   I don't know.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:26.720]   Like just put out some crazy experiments, just a test, see what would happen and kind
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.920]   of re-evaluate on those results.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:34.680]   But in terms of side hustles, I think this experimenter's mindset just reduces the sting
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.720]   of the inevitable failures that come along the way.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.320]   Cause it's like, you know, the first thing is probably not going to be a hit, but if
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.620]   you've positioned it in your mind as an experiment, you can kind of play scientist in the laboratory,
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:52.280]   you know, dust off and revisit the hypothesis and then go try something new.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   Great advice.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   Thank you.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.760]   Where can people find more about you and all these side hustles online?
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:02.560]   Of course, we'd love to have you tune into the side hustle show in your favorite podcast
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.760]   app, SideHustleNation.com/ideas is a, it's my constantly updated laundry list of, you

[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.620]   beyond some of the ideas that we, that we talked about today.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.620]   That sounds great.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   All right.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.620]   Thank you so much.

[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.840]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.760]   Wow.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.680]   You should definitely check out the amazing list of side hustles on Nick's site.

[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.600]   I know I'm definitely not monetizing my free time like I could, so I'm already trying to
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:43.080]   figure out what types of YouTube videos I can start recording and monetizing, of course.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.600]   Also, I'm actually printing up some great All The Hacks stickers.

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:16.400]   See you next week.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.960]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.760]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.100]   It's called The Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:33.440]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.980]   to save a dollar.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:38.920]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.320]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.660]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:59.620]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   plan.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.040]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.780]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.440]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.300]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.420]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.860]   Just search for The Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.820]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
