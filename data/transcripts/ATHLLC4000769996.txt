[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.880]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you join me as I try to find all
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.040]   the deals, hacks, and tricks there are.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.440]   And today we're talking about side hustles, ways you can monetize your
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.240]   spare time and hopefully start to build the foundation for some real passive
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.120]   income, and we're joined by the chief side hustler himself, Nick Loeber.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.720]   He's the founder of Side Hustle Nation, the host of the Side Hustle Show
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.880]   podcast, and has quite a few side hustles under his belt, including
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.360]   self-publishing a book, flipping products on eBay, and starting
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.840]   multiple online businesses.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680]   In our conversation, we'll talk about easy side hustles to get started with,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.400]   how to think about bigger opportunities that could replace your job, and how to
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.000]   come up with your next business idea.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.160]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.560]   Nick, thanks for being here.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   What is going on, man?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   Happy to be here.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.760]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.040]   I want to jump right into how you became the side hustle guy.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   I became the side hustle guy by coming out of a low point, like a soul
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.320]   searching low point of what do I want to do?
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.520]   What do I want to be known for?
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   What do I want people to find when somebody Googles you?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000]   And you kind of go through all of these business startup questions that I have
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760]   posed to my audience hundreds of times.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.120]   Like, what do you never get tired about talking about?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   You know, what lights you up?
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   What do people come to you for advice for?
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.000]   But it was kind of going through a low point and, you know, I'd started a bunch
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.520]   of other projects on the side and was looking for the next thing.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.680]   And this idea of a lower risk brand of entrepreneurship, because that was my
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.320]   background look, start something low risk, started on the side, build it up
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400]   as you have time and deconstructing, like, where does the money come from?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.360]   Deconstructing business ideas and business models was and still is
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.600]   fascinating to me.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.120]   And with that, I rebranded my long running personal blog that nobody ever
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.680]   read, rebranded NickLoper.com, DecideHustleNation.com in kind of spring
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   2013 and fired up the old podcast mic and started asking other people questions.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.000]   And it's been an incredible journey since then.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.840]   Yeah, you've done hundreds of episodes, talked to so many people.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.240]   I guess I just want to start off.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   So people understand one of the cool things you said, you know, and me coming
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120]   from a background where starting an entrepreneurial endeavor in Silicon
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.160]   Valley can often be something that takes millions of dollars and you hire lots of
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   people.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.560]   How do you tell people what a side hustle is as opposed to other entrepreneurial
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   endeavors?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.200]   And that's a good point because that was kind of the narrative that I was hearing.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.320]   An entrepreneur is somebody who raises venture capital, eventually takes this
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.960]   company public, like they want to go big.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   And I was like, well, there's this other flavor, this like lifestyle
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.240]   entrepreneur who, you know, maybe they don't even ever want to quit their job,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.440]   but they still want to, you know, use their free time more effectively, more
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.160]   productively.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.760]   Maybe they want to, you know, scratch this creative itch on the side.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.160]   But yeah, so side hustle broadly defined anything that you're doing outside of
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.960]   traditional job to make extra money, ranging from bartending, delivering
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   pizzas, driving Uber, all the way up to, you know, starting a company, starting a
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.600]   business.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   I will say there is more of an entrepreneurial connotation to it rather
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.280]   than just taking on a second job.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.400]   So generations ago, this might've been known as moonlighting, but today it's
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   more like, okay, this is my side hustle.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.760]   This is something that maybe long-term has the potential to be a little more time
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.440]   leveraged.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   It could be something that maybe replaces that day job income if you want it to.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   There's this positive upside connotation that doesn't necessarily come with that
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.080]   second job.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.560]   And, and was there a, an original side hustle that got this all started for you?
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.960]   It was called shoesniper.com and its latest iteration.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.120]   I don't think it exists anymore because it's been shut down for several years,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.600]   but this would pull in the product catalogs from Zappos, Amazon, all these
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.800]   other footwear retailers, and it would spit back out where you could find the
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.160]   best price on your next pair of shoes.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.400]   This was, you know, in the early days of the internet, some of your listeners
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.360]   might be young enough to remember like comparison shopping was a thing back in
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.440]   the day before everyone just went to Amazon by default was like, oh, there are
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.680]   several stores that sell this thing that I want.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.160]   And so the big idea for me was, well, what if instead of trying to compare every
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.640]   product under the sun, like, what if we focused on this one niche and we did it
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.680]   better than everybody else by, you know, having product level integrations and
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.480]   tighter kind of like comparison algorithms and more accurate algorithms.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.920]   And that was the thing that was, I kind of naively thought I could be the shoe guy.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.560]   Like this is this, I just, I'm the dude who sells shoes on the internet, but that
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.920]   was the thing that let me quit my job.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.240]   Uh, after three years of nights and weekends, like try to hustle that
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.440]   thing, uh, to the point of sustainability.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.160]   I don't even think it had replaced by day job salary by the time it was, uh,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   it was time to quit, but it had at least, it was at least covering my monthly
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.880]   expenses.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   And I could see with an extra 40, 50 hours a week to dedicate to it, how you'd
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.320]   get to that level, uh, and beyond.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.200]   And at that point, had you figured out that this whole space was where you
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.400]   wanted to spend time?
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.760]   You had a side hustle, it turned into your full-time thing and then side
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   hustles became your side hustle.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   Uh, it did.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.040]   That was like five years later.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.440]   Uh, so quit my job, you know, started the shoe operation like in 05, quit my job in
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.400]   08, started side hustle nation in 2013.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   So it was just, uh, you know, had a few years of entrepreneurial experience.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.880]   I called it retired at 25, but it turned out to be anything but a retirement.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.320]   It was like, I'm still working all the time.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   There's a lot of maintenance required.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   Like shoes is very seasonal, like constantly, uh, turning over inventory
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.680]   and stuff.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.880]   So there's a lot of upkeep, uh, involved in that, but it was still a pretty fun.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.040]   Uh, operation to try and optimize all of the inventory and ad listings and the
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.920]   conversion rates on the page and stuff.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.600]   It was a cool, it was definitely a cool first business.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.920]   And so that was your first one.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.360]   When you talk to people who are probably most often, you know, working a full-time
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.600]   job and they're thinking, wow, I could generate some side income.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.920]   I could pursue some passions.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.800]   Are there things you advise them to do to get started?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.760]   The passion question is an interesting one.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.680]   And maybe we can start there because in Nick Huber, who runs a podcast called
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   sweaty startup was on the side hustle show last year.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.720]   And he said, Nick, under no circumstance, should you start a business around your
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.200]   passion?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.080]   I was like, well, why not?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   You know, that seems like reasonable advice.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   He's like, look, if you're passionate about it, other people probably are too,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.960]   right?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.280]   Yoga, craft beer, whatever it is, the world doesn't care about your passion
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.920]   necessarily.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.520]   And when people are passionate about things, they behave irrationally.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.800]   Like they work for free.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   It's like, no, no, no, under no circumstance, start a business around your
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   passion, start a business around solving a problem instead.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.640]   And, you know, bonus points, if it's a problem that you're at least somewhat
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.520]   interested in or excited about.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.440]   And then, uh, cause I found that passion tends to follow doing the work.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.040]   Like in college, I was painting houses as like my, my college job, my college side
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.360]   hustle.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.240]   And I had no passion for painting houses, but by the end of a couple of summers of
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.960]   doing this, you couldn't help, but walking through a neighborhood and looking up
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.640]   under the eaves and like, oh, there's a paint job waiting to happen.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   I'll get off, scrape that.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.720]   I better make a note.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.400]   You come give these guys an estimate on the weekend.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.640]   It came from doing the work.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.600]   It came from embedding yourself in that space.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   And same, same thing with podcasting.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.160]   Had no passion for podcasting.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.080]   When I got started, it would have been impossible to, I didn't know what I was
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.120]   doing, how it all worked, but over the course of now eight years of doing it in
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   450 episodes of the side hustle show, it's become a part of my identity.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.760]   It's definitely become a huge passion of mine.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.480]   Well, I'm not sure I took that advice because this entire podcast was I'm
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.960]   passionate about finding all the deals, all the hacks.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.720]   And, uh, I turned that into a project, but for me, I guess it doesn't make a lot of
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:47.960]   money.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   So it's not a, it's not a side hustle yet.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.360]   Uh, it's more of just an outlet for creativity.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.240]   Well, I like that.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.400]   I like that approach too, though.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.360]   It's like, here's something that I'm curious about.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.240]   Here's something that I'm interested in and here's a unique medium to, to go out
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.920]   and explore that.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.160]   Right.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.480]   Because that is kind of the second part of the equation.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.680]   Okay.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.920]   What's, what's the problem in my life?
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.880]   I need more hacks.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   And then the second part is like, well, how do I go find them?
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.080]   I'm going to go, I'm going to go talk to people.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.640]   And one of the, the reasons when I talk to all of our listeners about why they're
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   really excited about a lot of different hacks is that they end up saving money.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.160]   They save time and it allows them to go travel places.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.360]   So I think one of the coolest things about side hustles is it allows you to
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.600]   generate that extra income.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   And you have a challenge I saw on your site, a five day, $500 challenge.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.280]   I assume the, the premise is that anyone can get started doing this, uh, and make
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.480]   some extra money in a short period of time.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.720]   Are there specific types of side hustles that are easy to get started for a
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.920]   beginner to make a little bit of extra cash?
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.960]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.440]   So at the very low end of the spectrum, like what can I do to kind of just toe
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.200]   dip into the side hustle world?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   Right?
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.760]   So this is like credit card rewards.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.680]   Like you're the expert on this stuff.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.760]   This is like cashback apps.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.160]   This is just no brainer stuff to add to your phone.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.760]   These are online market research studies.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   Like I just did one last week where I got paid 50 bucks in Amazon credit to talk
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.200]   about my video editing process.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.680]   It was like, this is any, you know, anybody can go do this stuff.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.040]   Where are you finding them?
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.800]   What are there?
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.520]   Is there a list of them on your site?
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   Do you have ones that you recommend checking out when it comes to some
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   of these market research things?
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.760]   My top two are userinterviews.com and respondent.io.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:43.600]   But the advantage that both of these have over like a swag box or something is that
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.680]   they like, they are looking for industry professionals and will usually pay for
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.640]   that expertise, you know, 50, 100, 150, 200 bucks an hour versus, you know,
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.320]   $3 an hour or whatever the equivalent would be just like doing these kind of
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.440]   brainless little surveys while you're watching TV.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.720]   So a little bit more involved, but you know, from the comfort of your home, I've
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.760]   done a handful of these different studies and I find that stuff interesting and it's
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.080]   like, well, shoot, if I can qualify for it, somebody else with more professional
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.920]   credentials could probably qualify for even more of these.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.040]   Those would be kind of low hanging fruit stuff.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.880]   On the product side, we see people just getting involved in the eBay or Facebook
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.600]   marketplace game where it's, you know, start by clearing out your garage,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.560]   clearing out your attic, you know, what is all this stuff that's collecting dust
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.760]   where it could be collecting dollars.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.000]   And then we see people kind of taking that to the next level where, you know,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.120]   it would be sourcing at garage sales, yard sales, estate sales, Craigslist.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.160]   We've even seen people going like from the free section of Craigslist
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.440]   onto Facebook marketplace.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.560]   There's like this weird arbitrage thing that's going on right now.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.960]   But those would be kind of the very low hanging fruit type of side hustles
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.800]   without getting into the freelancing or consulting or like selling a service
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.880]   type of operation, which probably be the next level up.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.360]   And of course, another one to consider is just all of the gig economy apps.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.880]   Maybe your long-term upside potential isn't really strong with a DoorDash or
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.240]   an Uber Eats or something like that.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.920]   But if you need to make money in the near term, like it's hard to beat this kind
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.800]   of plug and play functionality that they've built.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.520]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.240]   I get it.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.520]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.840]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.880]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.320]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.360]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.200]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.600]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.120]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.480]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.680]   ever leaving yours.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.600]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.840]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.200]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.800]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.880]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.800]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.160]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   And do you have a metric for how you compare these in your mind?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.720]   Is it dollars per hour?
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.360]   Is it things you can do in small blocks of time?
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.400]   How do you think about that?
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.680]   So think about dollars per hour is a good kind of baseline metric, but it can be
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.160]   misleading because you're like, Oh, I made 50 bucks an hour, but you can't, you
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.320]   couldn't do that eight hours a day.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.080]   You know, it's like, well, the opportunity came up and I made my 50 bucks and then
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.040]   it was kind of gone.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.280]   And the same thing with Instacart.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.000]   Like if you're, you know, cranking out Instacart orders and it's like, Oh, you
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.080]   know, you may have spurts where you're making 25, 30 an hour and you're like,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.800]   this is great.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.680]   And then you might have hit kind of this drive spell where you're like, uh, you
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.960]   know, maybe I'm making 10, 15, I got to pay for gas on top of this.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.840]   So there's this natural downward pressure in any of these like driving related
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.320]   services is a natural downward pressure on price because it's a skill that almost
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.840]   everybody has, you know, it's like, uh, there's only, there's only so much you
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   can do to, uh, to differentiate yourself there.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   But I do like the hourly rate metric.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.680]   I do like kind of thinking of how can I, what can I do to fit into the gaps in my
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.080]   day?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.320]   Even we have people on the podcast, like building online businesses, building
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.520]   these blog empires with a couple young kids at home.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.280]   I'm like, how are you getting this done?
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.000]   And she described like the cracks in her day.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.120]   And I was like, Oh, I really liked that metaphor where it's like, you know, the
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   nap time here or the, you know, play group over here, you're, you know, you're
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.360]   responding to emails.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.200]   There's, there's always ways to get it done.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.840]   If that makes sense.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.640]   Are there good side hustles for those 15 minute gaps?
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.960]   Obviously you're not going to hop in the car and drive to the grocery store and do
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.480]   some Instacart shopping with a 15, 20 minute gap.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.840]   But are there things that you've seen that work really well for people who only have
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.200]   small blips of time, but maybe you could stack them over the course of a few days?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.000]   Yeah, that's a challenging one where I might go with that.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.560]   One that my wife is involved in is just print on demand.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.640]   And so she has t-shirts on RedBubble and Merch by Amazon.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.520]   And I want to say a couple other places, but you know, with a 15 minute gap, she
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.760]   could probably design a t-shirt or at least kind of get a template design and
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.920]   she was in front of her computer.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.760]   So that's kind of one way to go.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.200]   And then there's some like uploading time related to that.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   And what's cool there is once it's created Amazon or RedBubble or these other
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.880]   marketplaces are handling all the shipping and fulfillment, you set your own
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.960]   price, you're just making a little margin on top of that.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.400]   And it's like, okay, it's not a huge moneymaker, but she had like some
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.280]   Father's Day related one that just recently sold.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.680]   And she's like, yes, you know, get a little sale notification.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.240]   It's just, you know, it's play money.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.120]   But if you took it seriously and you were consistent about creating that type of
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.760]   stuff, it can definitely add up.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.720]   And same thing with the online business.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.440]   If you are going to commit to writing a book, I want to go this self published
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:24.680]   route.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   If you want to start, you know, this blog or online based business, you have 15
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.160]   minute gaps, which it's easy to dismiss and say, I've only got 15 minutes.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.920]   What am I going to get done?
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:40.080]   If you sat down and use those 15 minutes to outline content or to draft your next
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.960]   email or to start creating this blog post, you kind of start chipping away at it.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.600]   And I find that momentum tends to build a little bit.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.240]   And I've definitely found that when tackling really, really long articles and
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   blog posts, like one of the things I think put SideHustle Nation on the map in its
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   earlier days was like these mega list posts where it's 5,000 words and it has all
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.640]   these ideas.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.680]   But some of these, I've got 40 hours into some of these posts, but the only way to
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.560]   tackle it was kind of like, okay, one step at a time in the, in the gaps that are
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:11.920]   allowed.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.440]   Yeah, it's funny you say this.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.200]   So I have tried to start a blog for, I don't know, almost a decade.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.000]   And I, I've always gotten like a one post in and then realized that I'm not going to
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.880]   keep doing this.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.360]   But I also realized like that one post could be valuable.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.960]   Is there a way for someone who's not ready to commit to blogging full time, but
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.400]   might have something interesting that they want to put together or something?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.240]   Is there an easy way to do that on like a one or two post basis without starting a
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.680]   blog?
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.160]   Yeah, I would just put it up on Medium, put it up on LinkedIn versus going through
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.920]   the trouble of setting up your own domain and hosting, and then it goes stale and
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.400]   then the domain expires and all that stuff.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.160]   So I would just go to some of these writing marketplaces as they were.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.400]   Cool.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.560]   And I want to go back to the side hustle your wife has.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.600]   Was it t-shirts or what kind of things is she designing?
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   Yeah, she's made t-shirts, she's made the socks, she's made mugs, I think she made
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.520]   stickers, like I think she sold a crapload of Eclipse stickers.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.160]   What was that like 2017, 2018, whenever that big Eclipse was going on.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.280]   She had a great month and we were like, "Duh, we just need another Eclipse to come
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.560]   along."
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   I gotta wait another 37 years or whatever it was.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.680]   How does that work?
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.760]   So I actually, for our anniversary this year, I got my wife this funny t-shirt on
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.480]   Amazon that just said "Epic Wife" since 2012.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.200]   I couldn't help but think, how is this happening?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.600]   Like, are these even designed?
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.320]   Did someone just make a logo and as soon as I order it, it gets printed?
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.320]   Is that something that if you had an idea for a funny mug or a cool sticker, you
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.040]   obviously don't have to go buy a printing press or anything like that.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.960]   How does that hustle work?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.880]   Right.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.240]   It's all print on demand.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.600]   So no, no screen printing machine in your basement or anything like that.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.560]   You upload this digital file.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.960]   So you create some clever saying.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.000]   Most of these are like just text based, so not, you know, no crazy artistry
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   required, upload that digital file to Amazon, set your price, set what kind of
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.840]   color t-shirts you want it to be on.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.520]   And they have a whole lot of other products now as well.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.920]   And then when somebody orders it, it's all, it's completely hands off.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.000]   And then it just shows up in your report as royalties earned.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.480]   When we first got started on this, it was like right around Trump's inauguration.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.960]   So the meme of the day was "alternative facts."
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.760]   You know, I forget who it was, like the press secretary was like, "Oh, the
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   president presented an alternative fact."
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.280]   And we're like, "Alternative fact is like such an interesting way to phrase it."
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.440]   And so we made like, "I went to the gym today, #alternativefacts" or something.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's a kind of a creative outlet and it doesn't take a ton of time to create.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.200]   Like the people who are doing really, really well at it have thousands and
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.560]   thousands of designs, or it becomes very much a volume game.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.440]   And of course there's an 80/20 distribution to everything that sells.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.560]   But you know, for one-off stuff, it can be fun.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   And she's, and she's done custom stuff for, for family and friends too.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.480]   Like, because now, you know, other people know that she's into it.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.600]   Like our buddy's going to his golf tournament.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.000]   "Hey, would you put, would you put this picture on a shirt?"
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.040]   It was just like, his buddy like passed out or something.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.280]   I don't know.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.000]   And they just let, she listed on Amazon?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.280]   And you know, he may be the only person who ever buys it, but it's just like,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.480]   "Yeah, I'll make you a custom shirt."
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.200]   It's kind of a fun, like, distribution center to have in your backyard, basically.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.480]   Where, you know, it's all Prime eligible and pretty affordable.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   I don't know how they're making money on it, but very, uh, it's pretty cool.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.600]   The shirt I got was less than $20 for a shirt that I, I, now that I think about
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.120]   it, I noticed there were a bunch of styles of the same kind of shirt.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   And I'm wondering if it was just someone uploaded 10 different
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.400]   designs of the same shirt.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.200]   And we would be remiss if we didn't mention like, once something sells, the
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.800]   software and the bots kind of come out and say, "Oh, this is a hot seller.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   Let's make a copycat.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   Let's make a duplicate of it."
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.960]   Because there's so little barrier to entry, it becomes kind of like, "Well, I
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.600]   gotta keep coming up with the next design rather than fighting copyright trolls and
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.880]   stuff."
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.840]   You mentioned another side hustle about, you know, delivery.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.800]   And one of the challenges is it's such a low barrier to entry.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.960]   Are there any skills that, you know, taking a quick course or getting registered to
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.360]   do something kind of unlocks some side hustle income?
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.760]   I know when we purchased our home, I talked to the person who came to our
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.400]   house to do our notarizing for the home purchase, said that this was their little
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.760]   side hustle, you know, a couple, couple of days a week, they do evening, evening,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.520]   things like that.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.840]   I have no idea how hard it is to become a notary.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   I don't know if that's a good one.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.720]   But are there things like that that can generate income that have a little bit
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.800]   higher barrier to entry that might make the sustainability of making more money
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.760]   higher?
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.240]   Yeah, the notary one is actually a perfect example.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.920]   That's one of the most, I don't know, I don't know why I say surprising, but out
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.800]   of all of the episodes that we've done, the one that I get an outsized feedback
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.840]   response to is on this mobile notary side hustle because it's not, it's not zero,
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.880]   but there's a little bit of startup cost in terms of education, equipment, and
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.160]   certification, but like, you know, maybe you're a thousand bucks and then you're
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.680]   going out and making a hundred bucks for every signing appointment.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.560]   We've seen people, especially with this low interest rate environment and all the
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.800]   refinancing that's going on, I've seen people making eight, nine, 10 grand a
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.160]   month doing this.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.960]   And on the side.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.400]   It might be a full-time gig at that point for them, but like, if you're just doing
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.040]   it on the side, like, you know, a thousand bucks, 2000 bucks a month, it doesn't
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.360]   seem unreasonable, especially since, you know, it's a good gig for nights and
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.080]   weekends because the people presumably signing mortgage documents have jobs.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.560]   That's what like the bank wants to see to lend you money and you know, they're
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.760]   working during the day, but they're available to sign evenings and weekends.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.960]   And it works out really well.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.000]   We've got a couple episodes.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.320]   I can send you the links.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.480]   Yeah, I'll put, I'll put links to those in the show notes for sure.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.880]   That talk about that, but that's one that stands out.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.040]   We've seen people level up their skills in like web design.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.600]   We had actually one of the most popular episodes of last year was Chris
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.640]   Mistrick from selfmadewebdesigner.com.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:11.880]   I think it's his site where he described learning from Code Academy, learning
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.280]   from free resources online, starting actually locally, selling the skill, going
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.440]   on to Upwork, bidding on jobs and continuing to double his rates until he
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.720]   started to get pushed back or had a harder time getting clients.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.640]   But it was like, you know, I don't know.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.840]   I thought that was a cool example of like learning an in-demand skill, even
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.720]   in what would seem to be, you know, with the rise of Squarespace and Wix.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.080]   And we like, it's not that hard to design a website anymore, but plenty
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.520]   of people still willing to pay for it because the pie just keeps getting
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.560]   bigger, people who presumably need websites.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.080]   He was able to do really well with that.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.360]   We had another gal who had, I don't know if she had a particular background in
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.160]   finance, but she kind of studied up on like the QuickBooks certification and
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.120]   kind of these other like online accounting programs and was like, I'll
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.560]   become your remote bookkeeper, which I thought was an interesting one.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.400]   And she was doing, you know, 50, 70 bucks an hour equivalent, you know,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.360]   from home, uh, doing, doing books.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.120]   And like, if you like math and numbers and I don't know, that kind of appealed
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.620]   to me.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.920]   And then recently, this was more of a career change, but I thought, I think
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   the model was illustrative of kind of a broader opportunity.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.600]   So we had Brad Rice and his argument was Salesforce as a software company
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.240]   has grown its customer base far faster than it's been able to grow its
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.080]   ecosystem of qualified service providers, consultants, freelancers to
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.320]   serve that customer base.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.040]   And he's like, and because of that, there is such an in-demand industry.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.080]   And he's like, you know, it's, it's rare to go from not being part of this
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   ecosystem to being like freelancer, uh, you know, solo remote freelancer
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.040]   consultant type of person.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.720]   But, you know, with two, three, four years under your belt, like that's a
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.320]   very common career path.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.640]   And he said he was making 200 grand last year, working 20 hours a week or
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.120]   something.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.400]   It's like, yeah, sign me up.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.440]   You know, it sounds pretty good.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.720]   But the way we framed that on the side hustle show was software with a
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   service, like hitching your cart to a popular software product.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.880]   Maybe it's QuickBooks, maybe it's Salesforce, maybe it's Asana, maybe it's
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.160]   Monday.com, maybe it's, uh, Airtable, you know, all these, you have this,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.320]   all these kinds of software and there's always more coming out.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.440]   They have their own little, uh, ecosystem of customers.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.720]   And if you can kind of become a go-to player, uh, in that space, like we had
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.120]   on the podcast, Paul Miners out of New Zealand, where he would just create
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.760]   these, uh, he was kind of early adopter in Asana.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.600]   He'd create these little short videos for YouTube to say like how to do
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.640]   blank in Asana.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.320]   And he just introduced that like, Hey, I'm Paul.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.960]   I'm an Asana consultant and here's how to do blah, blah, blah in Asana.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.320]   And he was booking like thousands of dollars worth of consulting gigs
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.360]   because, you know, companies were like, that's great.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.800]   Could you come in and train our team?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.880]   Could you come in and just help us, uh, implement these systems?
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.040]   So software with a service is one of these, uh, side hustle models that I
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.160]   think really has some potential, uh, to scale and drive some higher hours per
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:15.800]   dollar rates.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I would say to anyone listening, if there's a piece of software or even a, an
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.160]   activity that you feel like you've mastered, there's probably a marketplace
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.840]   for you to turn that into a business.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.320]   I know I always tell people, Oh yeah.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.000]   I, I hang, uh, TVs whenever we bought a new TV, I went through the effort to
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.880]   learn how to find, you know, mount it to the studs properly and do everything.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.040]   And other people I know hire someone to do that.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.720]   I don't know if there's a good, uh, marketplace for that, but if there's
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.000]   a thing that you've learned how to master and set up and do other people
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.640]   pay for those things and you can find marketplace for that.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.480]   Is there a place for in-person things?
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.000]   Like, is there an easy marketplace for me to put myself out there as someone
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.440]   who can tune up someone's bicycle?
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:05.560]   I'd probably look at TaskRabbit or Thumbtack for something like that,
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.640]   especially for the home services, even next door might be worth a look there.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.840]   Cool.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.280]   I mean, I know when we launched this podcast, I wanted to have show notes
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.000]   and, uh, I found this amazing woman in Canada on Fiverr who helps me write
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.720]   all the show notes and finds all the links for everything.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.560]   I know there are a lot of things on Fiverr.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.520]   If you have a microphone, people will pay as we did for the disclosure in
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.480]   some of our episodes for someone to just record a disclosure.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.680]   And if you have a good voice and you have a microphone, you might be
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.600]   able to do that work in a minute.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.360]   Um, so that's another interesting one online where I found at least on the,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.160]   on the, you know, buyer side, I found a lot of tasks and projects
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.440]   that I wanted to accomplish.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.480]   Even something as simple as we, we upgraded our wireless system in our
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.800]   house and we use Unify, which is a Ubiquity product, which is kind of
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.880]   designed for the enterprise.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.960]   And so the way you set it up is just more complicated than other things.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.160]   And I thought I have two options.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.360]   I could go learn everything about this and watch all the YouTube videos,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   or I could find someone who does this for a living and remotely could walk
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.640]   me through the settings and I could pay them, you know, 25, 30, 40, 50 bucks
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.280]   to spend an hour and just walk through everything so I can get it completely
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.720]   done and save myself the.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.280]   Five, 10 hours of reading every possible thing about how to set it up.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.920]   And so even if you've just learned how to use a particular tool that doesn't
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.000]   even feel like an enterprise system, like Salesforce, you might still be
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.360]   able to market yourself as an expert, helping someone set things up or,
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.960]   you know, build a well-designed presentation and keynote or PowerPoint.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.720]   I know there's definitely a market for presentation design also.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.760]   All of those, all of those things.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.040]   Fiverr is a fascinating platform where there's always room for new entry
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.920]   points because the top rated people naturally get busy and flooded with
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.320]   orders.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.520]   And so you go and you want to book this person because they've got, you
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.440]   know, a thousand five-star reviews and they're like, well, I'm like booked
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.160]   three weeks out.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.480]   And so then you're like, well, okay, well back to the drawing board, like,
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.800]   okay, I'm going to take my chance with this guy with fewer reviews.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.560]   So that's one way to go there.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:17.240]   Oh, the other thing on that, like if you have a problem that you've overcome
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.640]   that you've like solved this problem in your own life, record the YouTube
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.000]   video about it.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.480]   I don't care like how boring it is.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.640]   It could just be like a screen recording video.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.720]   The reason is like these tend to, if it was a problem in your life, other
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.440]   people are looking for how to do it as well.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   I had videos on like how to download high resolution images from Instagram.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.960]   It had like 9,000 views before they changed the interface.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   And my little trick didn't work anymore.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.640]   How to create a folder in Gmail.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.760]   I think that's still up there.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.080]   It still generates views, generates ad revenue every month.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:56.120]   How to, uh, how to stop Dropbox from like taking up your local hard drive
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:56.920]   storage or something.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.400]   It was like this little unsync checkbox and still generating views and ad
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.280]   revenue every month.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.080]   So, uh, think of these little like mini digital assets that you can create and
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.760]   you, you have to build a certain subscriber base before you can get monetized
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.640]   on YouTube.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.040]   But if you create enough of these, like just, you know, one of them is bound to
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.840]   hit after a while.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.920]   It's just kind of like found money.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.000]   It feels like the most passive income in the world to me.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.680]   And do you, you said you have to have a certain subscriber base.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.040]   Can, can anyone not create a YouTube video and start to monetize?
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.680]   How does that work?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.920]   Your channel needs to have, I want to say a thousand subscribers and maybe
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.400]   4,000 hours of total watch time.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.080]   And then they'll let you turn on monetization.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.360]   And then they'll let you turn on the ads.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.880]   And, and if you had made a couple of those videos, do you, do those generate
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.000]   subscribers or is that harder to get than, than views?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.720]   Subscribers are probably harder to get than views.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.400]   So it's, you kind of have to have a concerted effort of producing content.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.040]   But if you have one thing that goes viral, it tends to happen faster than, uh, than
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.200]   you might think, or at least it has, uh, in my case.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.560]   Cool.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.320]   Now you also mentioned passive income, which is an interesting, uh, thing that
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.160]   I'm not sure is passive income a side hustle or is it separate?
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.520]   And how do you think about that?
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.600]   I try to think of it as like time leveraged, right?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.160]   So the, the, the most passive income that I have is just like, you know,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.000]   straight up dividend income.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.840]   Like it's going to happen quarter after quarter, whether or not I do anything.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.680]   The other income streams, like income from the blog and come from the podcast
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.920]   income from YouTube, consider those like kind of more like time leveraged income
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.160]   streams where it's like, okay, it takes the same amount of time to produce this
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.720]   blog post.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.400]   If 10 people read it or 10,000 people read it, it takes the same time to produce
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.120]   this video.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.560]   If nobody watches it or, you know, 10,000 people watch it.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.120]   So think of the time leverage element.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.760]   And if you think about your income as a pie chart today, I think it's natural for
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.920]   everyone to start out in their career with a hundred percent of that pie chart being
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.480]   active income, like trading time for money.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.880]   But, you know, if the ultimate goal is, you know, retirement or, you know, where
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.680]   work becomes optional, you kind of need to fill in the rest of that pie chart with
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   passive income or time leveraged income.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.040]   And this is the Warren Buffett thing.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.200]   Like, you know, if you don't find a way to make money in your sleep, you're going
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.560]   to work until you die.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.000]   And it's, it's true.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.400]   So what can you do in the near term to kind of like grow that little sliver, you
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.920]   know, maybe it's a little sliver of dividend investments or, you know, savings
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.920]   account interest at 0.4 percent or whatever awful percent it is now.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.520]   One of my favorite examples from the Side Hustle show in that realm was Matt
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.160]   Bochnock, whose side hustle was repairing motorcycles in his garage.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.640]   Mechanical engineer by day, father of three or four by night, and repairing
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.720]   motorcycles in his garage in Chicago.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.680]   Like, hours for dollars, service-based business.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.560]   Add on Craigslist.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.760]   Like, don't pay dealership rates.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.160]   Bring it to me.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.800]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:55.160]   What Matt did, which I thought was genius, was setting up the camera in the
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.520]   corner of the garage, films himself doing the repairs.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.280]   So now he's got content for YouTube.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.240]   He starts selling these full engine rebuild videos.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:09.400]   And fast forward, you know, several years of doing this by investing this little
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.040]   speculative amount of time where he wasn't getting paid to build this time
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.080]   leveraged asset.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.960]   And over the course of several years, you know, now he's not really turning
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.240]   wrenches for dollars anymore.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.760]   Now he's making YouTube ad money, making affiliate income from the products he
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.260]   recommends.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.040]   He's selling full engine rebuild videos.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.480]   Insurance companies have found his channel and are now paying him to do, like,
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.040]   "Would you make a video for our insurance blog?"
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.320]   I think that was a really cool example of being proactive about growing that
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.080]   time leveraged piece of the pie, even though it was somewhat speculative,
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.120]   somewhat, you know, risky.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.280]   I might not see any return on this, but over time it definitely ended up paying
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:48.840]   off.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.080]   And I guess on a broader sense, you could think of, "Okay, how can I get paid
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.640]   over and over again from work that I do once?"
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.560]   Like, that's like the ultimate time leverage.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.240]   It doesn't necessarily have to be like, "How does this scale?"
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.800]   But maybe it is taking a percentage of those earnings, putting them into, you
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.880]   know, blue chip dividends.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.800]   Maybe it is, you know, creating that tutorial demo video for YouTube.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.400]   But, you know, it's something that has the potential to reach many, many more
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.200]   people than just whoever you were doing it for originally.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.280]   I'll just say, sometimes it just takes time, right?
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.720]   You make a video, it might not get found the first week, the first month.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.960]   But keep in mind that the barrier was low, so keep trying.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.600]   I know content sometimes takes a while to catch on.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.480]   You know, as I've been growing this podcast, I've been talking to podcasters,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.800]   and almost everyone I talked to said, you know, the first 10, 20, 30, 40 episodes
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.840]   were so hard.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.600]   I can't remember the percent, but it was like, if you can get to 20 episodes in
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.840]   a podcast, you're in the top 5%, because most people don't make it that far.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.480]   And so the number one piece of podcast audience growth advice I've gotten is
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.840]   just stay in the game.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.680]   So if you're trying some of these things, recording videos of doing things, don't
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.440]   expect that if you just record a video of how to use a piece of software better,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.360]   that tomorrow it's going to blow up.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.760]   But over time, it might build to something that could be pretty meaningful, and
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.520]   the effort is pretty low to get started.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.000]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.040]   I was just pulling up my active campaign demo video that I did for YouTube.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.600]   This was three summers ago, and did pretty much nothing, you know, for the first
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.680]   several months of being out there.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.920]   And even today, now three years later, it's only got 23,000 views.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.280]   So not huge, you know, it's not going viral by any means.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.920]   But my active campaign affiliate commissions, I think, since that time have
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.680]   been $5,000, $6,000.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.680]   So in creating this asset, you know, it just becomes another, you know, I like to
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.720]   think of like creating these digital assets that go out into the world and kind of like
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.360]   do your bidding.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.960]   Like these little minions that come back and bring money back to you.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.200]   And that's definitely been probably one of the more successful examples of that.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.160]   But didn't, like you said, didn't have a ton of viral success or instant success out
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.800]   of the gate.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.760]   But it's just one of these things.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   It just kind of keeps churning along, keeps generating views and revenue every month.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.880]   I know there are some larger side hustles that I'm curious how you think fit into
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.840]   someone's journey.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   Things like online courses and books and starting a blog.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.240]   Are those things that people should get their feet wet with side hustles before they start
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:21.800]   something big?
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.200]   Or is that something you could just start out the gate?
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.800]   I like the process of kind of learning as you go with stuff like that.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   So if you go into that with that expectation of like, I like you said, I'm podcasting,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.480]   but I'm not making any money from podcasting, right?
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.360]   Like if you need to make money quickly, choose a different path.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.000]   But I do like this path over the long run, because you're going to learn some really
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.200]   interesting skill sets.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.120]   You're probably going to be networking and meeting really interesting people in your
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.600]   niche.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.320]   And hopefully you're building up an audience and a network of your own.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.360]   I mean, that's been the biggest, you know, speaking of life hacks, one of the biggest
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.920]   ones for me has been starting this podcast.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.400]   And it was, you know, $50 mic, corner of the living room.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.520]   You know, is this thing on type of stuff early on.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.840]   But, you know, that's allowed me to have conversations with so many different people.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.600]   That's allowed me to make friends really all over the world that I never really anticipated.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.280]   It was just kind of like, oh, you know, people say, if you want to have a personal brand,
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.320]   you got to have a podcast.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.200]   And it was definitely not monetized or not monetized very well in its early days, but
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.000]   definitely turned into a life changing thing.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.840]   So I am definitely pro content creation, blog, podcast, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, whatever
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.080]   your channel of choice may be.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:43.160]   But just, you know, if you put in the consistent effort, it tends to either find out that you
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.600]   like it and you don't mind that you're not making any money, or you find out that you
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.560]   don't like it and you're like, okay, you know, I'll try something else.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.760]   So there's really, and it's so inexpensive to start, you really have a very limited downside
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.260]   on that stuff.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.440]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.240]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.400]   One piece of advice, if anyone out there is thinking of starting a podcast, Ramit Sethi
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:25.080]   gave me the advice that when you start a podcast, you could always just say you're going to
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.400]   have season one and not have season two.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.360]   So you could have an eight episode season one and not feel like you've necessarily committed.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.120]   So when I was first getting going, I was like, you know what, maybe I'll just say I'm going
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.920]   to launch one season with eight episodes and see what happens.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.840]   And by the time I'd recorded the third episode, I was like, I love doing this.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.880]   I'm not going to stop at eight.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.960]   So I don't need to create that structure.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.400]   But anytime you're doing stuff like this, you can always set it up so that it's okay
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.680]   that it's not a forever thing.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:57.240]   I met the host of the Sleep With Me podcast.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.000]   He goes by Scooter on the podcast.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.600]   I forget his name in real life.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.000]   And it's a boring bedtime story podcast, not a sex podcast.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   It's like, you know, plug this in as you're going to sleep.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.920]   He'll tell you a super boring story and eventually you'll fall asleep.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.560]   But what he told me he did was set quit dates.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.240]   So if I am going to put this, you know, arbitrary date on my calendar, three months out, six
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.960]   months out, and I'm not going to think twice about doing my thing, practicing my craft
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.680]   until that date.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.120]   When that day comes, I'm going to re-evaluate, say like, is this something that I want to
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.840]   keep doing?
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.560]   Yes or no.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:35.400]   And that eliminated the day-to-day doubt that can creep in like, is this worth it?
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.760]   Do I really want to do this today?
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.440]   It's like, nope, it's not quit date yet.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.640]   So let's keep at it.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.320]   I like that.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.240]   So we talked about some of these smaller things, creating some content.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:51.240]   We talked about some of the things like driving for Lyft or Uber, maybe even becoming a notary,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.920]   things that you can do in your spare time.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.200]   When people start to think about this, eventually a side hustle kind of becomes something that
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.480]   could be bigger.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.320]   And I know some of these different side hustles that you talk about when you interview guests
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.200]   on your show, they're bigger endeavors.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.320]   How do you think people should think about bigger side hustles and things that could
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.080]   actually become full-time jobs?
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:24.200]   So one of the things I think is important to think about from the early days is, okay,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.640]   aside from just like the dabbling stuff that we talked about, but if you're like, okay,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.120]   this is a business, this is something that I really want to pursue, is trying to find
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.080]   somebody three, four, five years down the road.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.680]   What does their life look like?
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.720]   They hit it, they had success, but what's their day-to-day?
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.800]   And is that a win for you, right?
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.040]   Because the last thing you want to do is pursue this path, really put your energy into it
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.680]   and then get to the "destination" and have it be like, "Ah, yeah, this isn't awesome.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.560]   This is not what I wanted."
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.040]   So try to think ahead to the extent that you can.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.800]   Like, okay, what does success look like?
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.440]   I don't think I'm the world's greatest entrepreneur, probably in the bottom quartile, actually,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.880]   in terms of scaling and systems and all that stuff.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:15.320]   But if you can figure out a way to remove yourself from the technical delivery of the
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.840]   work and if you can build with that intention, if that's your goal, right?
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.200]   Because there's different paths.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.040]   Sometimes like, "I love cleaning houses, so that's going to be my thing."
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.360]   It may be a difference in mentality from the early days.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.920]   If instead of saying, "I'm a freelance writer," saying like, "I run a freelance copy agency
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.360]   or freelance writing agency," instead of like, "I walk dogs, I have a dog walking
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.240]   company."
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.920]   Oh, we had a woman on the show who started a pooper scooper business.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.160]   But if instead of, "I'm a pooper scooper," no, "I run a pet waste removal business."
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.080]   And if you can build that margin and expectation from the clients, like, "No, it's not going
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.520]   to be me doing the work, but we're going to have qualified professionals come out and
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.320]   do the work."
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.960]   If you can set that up from the early days, then you're kind of built to scale and potentially
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.320]   built to sell down the road.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:09.160]   And if you have a business with recurring weekly customers, that can become an attractive
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.920]   acquisition target for other companies too.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.720]   So a lot of these examples, people had a business.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:21.400]   Are there ways that you suggest people start to generate ideas for a business that they
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.800]   could start on the side and maybe grow into something bigger?
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.600]   I love talking business idea frameworks.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.760]   How much time do we have?
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.840]   We've got a few of these we could actually run through.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.960]   The first is...
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.080]   So everybody says, "Start with your passions, start with your skills."
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.960]   I want to flip that and say, "Well, okay, that's definitely one option."
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.000]   But second option is start with pain points.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.640]   And so normally you try and be a little more of an optimistic person, but you got to put
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.080]   on your pessimistic hat for this one.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.280]   I call this the "What Sucks" method.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.640]   And this is where you have a...
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.840]   I just kind of do this on a notes app on my phone.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:02.600]   I'm going through, over the course of a day or a week or two weeks, note everything that
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.480]   bothers you, everything that's a pain point in your life, everything that somebody else
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.120]   complains to you about, put it in the "What Sucks" file.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.040]   Because on the flip side of that, there might be a business opportunity.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.280]   And that was Erica with her poop scooping business.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.320]   She was out in the backyard, cleaning up after her own dog, thinking like, "This kind of
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.720]   sucks.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.840]   But you know what?
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.080]   If it sucks for me, it probably sucks for other people too.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.720]   I wonder if people would pay to get this done."
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.040]   So that's kind of the "What Sucks" method, trying to connect pains with what people would
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.840]   pay for in this problem-solving mode.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.040]   Another opportunity that I like is called the "Rip, Pivot and Jam" method, which comes
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.240]   from Dan and Ian in the Tropical MBA podcast.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:48.680]   This is step one, rip, find another business that you like, blatantly steal that.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.640]   And then step two, really important, pivot that to a different audience, different niche,
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.720]   different industry, whatever it may be.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.920]   And then jam, go do the work.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.000]   And I implemented this in real life.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.400]   I was researching a failed side hustle of mine in the wine-related niche.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.560]   I know nothing about wine.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.360]   I don't care about wine.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.640]   Had no business being there.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.480]   But in the process of researching that site, I came across this website that was reviewing
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.360]   wine clubs.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.240]   And you could kind of punch in what you were looking for.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.720]   And they were like, you could have user reviews down at the bottom.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.640]   And of course, looking back, I think these were kind of like manipulated rankings where
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.560]   they wanted the one that paid them the most affiliate commission showed up on top.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.200]   But I was like, "Well, this is a really cool model.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.800]   What could I pivot that to?"
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:41.640]   And kind of combining the "What Sucks" method as well was like one of the pain points that
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.080]   I had in growing the shoe business was like, "Where do I find qualified, virtual, remote,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.200]   outsourced help?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.480]   How do I know which of these companies are legit operators?
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.440]   How does it work?
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.240]   Is this... do I pay payroll taxes?"
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.320]   It was totally green.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.680]   I didn't know anything about it.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:05.400]   So I pivoted the wine club review site to be a virtual assistant review site and actually
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.880]   ran that for close to 10 years before selling it at the end of last year.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.480]   But that became the first and largest virtual assistant company directory and review platform
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.040]   using that RIP, pivot, and jam method.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.720]   And then the final method that I'll share today is what I'll call the sniper method,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:29.320]   which I think works really well for service businesses, for e-commerce type of businesses,
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.640]   where if you look at Amazon as a shotgun business, right?
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.560]   We sell everything under the sun and we can have one-stop shopping.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:43.160]   The sniper method or the sniper business idea method is like, "What if we became the go-to
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.680]   place for a tiny sliver of Amazon's catalog?"
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.680]   And it's kind of like what the shoe business did, right?
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.240]   Instead of, you know, if Price Grabber was the shotgun back in that day, like, okay,
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.640]   shoe sniper is going to be like, "I only want to focus on footwear and I'll pick off that
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.320]   little segment of your business."
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.280]   You've probably seen that meme where it's like, you know, "Here's the screenshot of
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.120]   Craigslist and all of the different startups that are picking off the different sections
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:06.840]   of Craigslist.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.200]   Like, here's Airbnb.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.160]   Here's TaskRabbit.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:14.920]   Here's all these different little apps that kind of pick off little portions of a larger
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.720]   business."
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.000]   Could you give an example of one thing that someone could do just to kind of bring that
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.720]   last one to life?
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.880]   I see ads for like a general handyman type of service, but where it may be more compelling
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.560]   or maybe easier to carve out space.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.680]   Like, what if you became the go-to person, like you mentioned, for flat-screen TV mounting?
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:40.040]   That was, that's a great one because I feel like it's a skill that you don't need as much
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.800]   skill as a lot of the people who are doing it have.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.400]   So it probably, you could probably build a directory of people who would install TVs
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.440]   in people's homes for, you know, under 50 bucks.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.120]   But I imagine if you call a home theater company and ask them to come install your TV or a
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.280]   handyman, you might be paying 100, 150 bucks.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.240]   So someone out there could go start the directory of people to install TVs on your wall and
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.440]   probably take a, you know, a small cut of all the transactions and have a good business.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.160]   And in the online world, you see general graphic design firms.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.520]   We do logos.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.560]   We do book covers.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.520]   We do web design.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.480]   Like, we do t-shirts, you know, we do all this stuff.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.800]   It's like, okay, what if you could carve out a space?
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.600]   Like, look, we know book covers.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.520]   You know, we've done all of these book covers.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.760]   Look at these best-selling things in our portfolio.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   Like, be the go-to spot for that specific need.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.800]   I think that would be an example of using the Sniper method.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.000]   And even, you could even say like, we only do, you know, vampire romance or we only do,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.600]   you know, self-published self-help books or, you know, we only do memoirs.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.200]   You know, there's even sub-niches in there, which could get even more snipier.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.600]   I mean, one thing that that just made me think about when I think about designing book covers,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.320]   that's probably something someone does for their day job.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.920]   Obviously, you know, if you're doing something for your day job,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.280]   you should talk to your employer before getting in any trouble.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:08.200]   But is turning what you do for your profession at work into freelance work
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.480]   that you could do for other people something that can be a good side hustle?
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.760]   It definitely can be.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.920]   But like you said, be careful with any sort of non-competes that may be going on
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   because you wouldn't want to risk your livelihood there.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.080]   We've seen some examples.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.160]   One was Daniel DiPiazza.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.320]   He ran a site called Rich 20-something.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.120]   But back in the day, he was like working for Sylvan Learning Center or something.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.240]   Like, he was a tutor and he was making 18 bucks an hour as a tutor.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.640]   And he's like looking at the pricing on the website.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.120]   He's like, he knows the parents are paying this company 100 bucks an hour.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.880]   He's like, there's a lot of margin in there.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.320]   Like, what if I could just go direct?
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.800]   And so what he ended up doing was like,
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.120]   I'm going to teach this SAT prep class and I'm not going to do a one-on-one.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.400]   I'm going to do it in a group setting.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.560]   So he had like all of these people come in,
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:57.480]   just exploded his hourly rate by going one to many and cutting out the middleman.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.200]   So I was like, I don't know if Sylvan was too happy about that.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.400]   But so just make sure, you know, that wasn't,
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.880]   that one lended itself well to that type of model.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.080]   But just make sure, you know,
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.560]   I don't want to get anybody in trouble with their day job.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.520]   Yeah, of course.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.480]   But you know, if you were a designer during your day job,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.960]   you could probably do freelance design on the side.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.920]   I wouldn't do it for a company that competes with your primary employer
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.800]   and I'd get permission.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.560]   But yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunities to spin up freelance
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.200]   work around things that you've done in the past.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.920]   And so one thing I didn't ask is, you know,
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.200]   you keep having all these examples of things you've tried.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.080]   You know, you're a full-time side hustler, I guess.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.640]   Now, how do you make a living?
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.680]   Is it a stack of 20, 30 different side hustles?
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.040]   Is it one primary thing?
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.840]   How have you turned this into your kind of lifestyle?
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:51.000]   It is a stack, but most of the stacks are in the same deck
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.760]   and that's the Side Hustle Nation deck.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.200]   So the two biggest pieces of the pie right now
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.280]   are sponsorships on the podcast
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.960]   and affiliate revenue through the site in the email list.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.720]   The third leg of the stool historically
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   has been my own side hustle experiments.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.520]   That was like, you know, where the virtual assistant site lived.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.680]   That's where the shoe business lived.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.280]   That's where like the self-publishing
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.000]   and the freelancing and the eBay experiments
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.120]   and like all the other stuff
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.880]   kind of lived in that third leg of the stool.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.840]   That's kind of admittedly a shorter leg of the stool these days.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.040]   Outside of just side hustles, you know,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.160]   you optimize so many things in that regard.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.640]   Are there any favorite life, money,
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.440]   travel hacks you have that you want to share with people?
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.960]   I mean, one thing that has been immensely helpful,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.440]   especially with a couple of young kids
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.480]   is getting the workout in first thing in the morning.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.000]   And this is like just, you know, 10, 20 minutes,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.600]   usually like body weight stuff,
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.840]   maybe some kettlebells, maybe some bands.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.120]   But just getting that in,
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.840]   I feel a million times better the rest of the day
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.000]   when I have checked that off first thing in the morning.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.320]   And then just like favorite tools wise,
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.760]   I mean, everybody probably knows about LastPass, TextExpander.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.400]   I was singing the praises of Gmail shortcuts
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.680]   just this morning, just like flying through email.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.160]   Like if you're not using the R and the K and the J
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   and the control enter to send stuff,
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.280]   like you're missing out,
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.040]   like I could process stuff really fast that way.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.000]   And then other desktop productivity thing
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.360]   that I use all the time is called ClipX for Windows,
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.920]   which is a clipboard manager that lets you,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.040]   like will bring up like the last 25 things,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.880]   I want to say that you've copied and pasted.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.080]   'Cause I'm always, I don't know,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.600]   sometimes it's like I want the third or fourth thing
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.240]   down on the list,
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.720]   but instead of having to go re-grab it again,
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.120]   you can just use ClipX for that.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.800]   And I want to say CopyClip
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.040]   is maybe the Mac equivalent of that.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.680]   But yeah, lots of different tools.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.000]   - Yeah, I use Alfred on the Mac,
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.880]   which is a replacement for the Spotlight Finder.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.240]   And one of its features is that it stores your clipboard
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   and you can go back and look at different things.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.080]   Even things like if you take a screenshot,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.120]   all kinds of stuff like that.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.400]   So I don't know what I would do
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.080]   without Alfred on the computer.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.400]   It would add significant time to my day.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.680]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.640]   - Cool.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.000]   Well, this was fantastic.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.760]   I feel like if I didn't start this podcast,
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.000]   I'd be ready to go start a few other side hustles.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.200]   But this is really the side hustle for me right now.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.680]   And I'm excited to use some of these tactics
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.480]   to try to help grow it over the next few months
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.920]   and weeks and hopefully years.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.200]   Any other parting advice?
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.160]   - I mean, the big thing that I like to say
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.560]   is just think of it as an experiment.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.240]   I mean, life is one big experiment
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.320]   and I don't think side hustles are any different.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.160]   I read somewhere that at any given point,
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.960]   Amazon is testing like a thousand little variables
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:36.600]   on their website,
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.280]   trying to eke out that next like 0.002 conversion rate.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.640]   And I think we can apply the same method to our own life,
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.720]   probably on a smaller scale,
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.960]   but say like, what are you experimenting with?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.160]   What are you testing this month?
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.720]   Like maybe it's doing the workout
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.680]   first thing in the morning.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.600]   Maybe it is starting that podcast.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.880]   Maybe it's making a YouTube video.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.240]   Maybe it's, what happened if I went vegan?
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   What happened, what would happen if I quit coffee?
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.880]   I don't know, just put out some crazy experiments,
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.200]   just to test, see what would happen
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.640]   and kind of reevaluate on those results.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.080]   But in terms of side hustles,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.840]   I think this experimenter's mindset
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   just reduces the sting of the inevitable failures
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.640]   that come along the way.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.120]   'Cause it's like, the first thing
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.800]   is probably not gonna be a hit,
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.840]   but if you've positioned it in your mind as an experiment,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.000]   you can kind of play scientist in the laboratory,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.840]   dust off and revisit the hypothesis
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.120]   and then go try something new.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.440]   - Great advice, thank you.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.040]   Where can people find more about you
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.480]   and all these side hustles online?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.360]   - Of course, we'd love to have you tune into
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   the Side Hustle Show in your favorite podcast app,
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.560]   sidehustlenation.com/ideas is a,
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.400]   it's my constantly updated laundry list
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.240]   of part-time money-making ideas.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.920]   That you could start today.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.080]   There is no opt-in required over there
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.800]   to hopefully get the creative juices flowing
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.600]   beyond some of the ideas that we talked about today.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.280]   - That sounds great.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.560]   All right, thank you so much.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.680]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.800]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.000]   - Wow, you should definitely check out
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.560]   the amazing list of side hustles on Nick's site.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.240]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.000]   I know I'm definitely not monetizing
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.520]   my free time like I could.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.960]   So I'm already trying to figure out
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.280]   what types of YouTube videos I can start recording.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.400]   And monetizing, of course.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.640]   Also, I'm actually printing up
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.400]   some great All The Hacks stickers.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.760]   So if you want me to mail you one,
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.960]   head over to allthehacks.com/stickers.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   And thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.160]   If you're enjoying the show,
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.160]   please consider sharing your favorite episode
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.240]   with a few people you think might enjoy it.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.520]   And if you wanna get in touch,
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.200]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com and @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.800]   That's it for now.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.600]   See you next week.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.760]   (upbeat music)
