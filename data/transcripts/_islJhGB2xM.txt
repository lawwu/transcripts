[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.140]   A podcast listener named Becky writes in with a level of desperation in her words
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.480]   to ask this, "Pastor John, when I first came to Christ I was obsessed with Him, on
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   fire and in love with Him. Slowly that started to fade even though I wanted Him
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.880]   so badly. My husband deployed for six months, we had a bad marriage and it's
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.640]   like I never knew the Lord at all. I committed adultery, turned to pornography,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.080]   began to do drugs and drink alcohol, cut myself, stopped reading my Bible and
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.800]   stopped praying. God tested my faith and I failed miserably for those six months.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120]   Over a year of not feeling God's presence at all, I can't even mentally
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.760]   journal or pray or read my Bible anymore, I can't do it and nobody understands. I
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.320]   feel that if I were truly saved my sin would have gotten smaller and less
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.760]   desirable as Jesus became more desirable, but it didn't. He didn't. The thing is I
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680]   know I loved Jesus. Now all I feel is separation from God. I hardly even feel
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.760]   guilty for the things I did, if at all. I'm terrified of God. I'm terrified for
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.040]   my salvation. I want Him, I miss Him, I need Him, but nobody, nobody understands
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.000]   me. I want to be saved and I don't think I am. I need help. Why is my heart so
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.800]   hardened? Why doesn't God want me back? Can you help me?"
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:34.540]   Becky, your cry for help is mingled with evidences of hope, like a want to be
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:44.080]   saved, and terrors of hopelessness, like I'm getting farther and farther away,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.000]   like a ship sailing to the end of the world or a boat going over a waterfall.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   Now from my distance here, I don't know you well enough to have any clear sense
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.840]   of whether in fact you are born again, but I want to take encouragement from
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.240]   your own testimony that you once loved Christ. You said so. I want to take
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   encouragement from that, but whether or not that's true could have been fake for all
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.760]   I know or even you know. That's not the issue now. I want to help you with this.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.040]   That's not the issue now. The issue now is not the past. The issue is the present
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.600]   and the future. Don't drive yourself crazy trying to analyze the authenticity
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.680]   of the horrible and glorious past. You'll never figure it out. That's just not
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.160]   where assurance is going to be found. Faith comes from hearing, and hearing by
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:01.000]   the Word of God. Faith comes from seeing God at work, often in the lives of others.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.560]   So let me simply give you some beautiful truth from God's Word and then a few
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   stories from God's faithfulness to people like you, and I'm praying now that
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.440]   God might use this to miraculously, not because you deserve it or I'm effective,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   but miraculously awaken new, fresh, sure faith. So two passages of Scripture.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.720]   Let me just read them to you as you listen and pray that God would make them beautiful.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:48.480]   This is Micah, the prophet Micah. I sang a song yesterday based on this text.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   Who is a pardoning God like you? And who has grace so rich and free? And who has
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.040]   grace so rich and free? That song that I love very much comes out of this text.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.080]   It goes like this. Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.560]   transgression? In other words, Becky, there's no God like this. He
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.280]   pardons iniquity. He passes over transgression for the remnant of his
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:27.920]   inheritance. He does not retain his anger forever because he delights in steadfast
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.240]   love. And I would add, way more than judgment. He delights in it. This is his
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.920]   first choice. He will again have compassion on us. He will tread down our
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.560]   iniquities underfoot. Do you hear that, Becky? Not tread you down. He will tread
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   down our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.040]   sea. You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham as you
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:13.000]   have sworn to our fathers from of old. So in Christ, this promise is yours. Who is a
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.520]   pardoning God like thee? And who has grace so rich and free? That's Micah 7, 18 to 20.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   And here's the other text, 1 Timothy 1, 15. Paul says, "The saying is
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.840]   trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. Christ Jesus came into the
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:46.280]   world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost." I think Paul is saying to you,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.480]   Becky, there, "You're not the foremost. I am." Don't compete with Paul here. He is
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.160]   trying to make a case for why mercy shown to him can be mercy shown to you,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.200]   because he's the foremost. He says, "I received mercy for this reason, that in
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:14.240]   me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.520]   example to those like Becky who were to believe in him for eternal life, though
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.320]   they were sinners like me." Verse 17, "To the King of Ages, immortal, invisible, the
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.400]   only God be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen." Indeed, honor and glory for
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:44.480]   such patience. So those are two passages, Micah 7, 18 to 20, 1 Timothy 1, 15 to 17.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:54.880]   Meditate on them long and hard. Quick three stories. 1975, Munich, Germany.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.240]   John Piper is sitting in a German church, learning my German. I was getting enough
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.480]   that I loved this story. I've never forgotten it. A woman standing in white,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.280]   ready to be baptized. She gave her testimony, and her testimony was that she
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.840]   lived all her life as a Jehovah's Witness, and she could never, ever be sure
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.760]   that she was saved. It was driving her crazy. There was no assurance of
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.080]   salvation, and she came to the point of deciding, "I cannot go on like this. I'm
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.500]   certainly gonna take my life." Somehow, God put it in her heart that before she
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.360]   took her life, she would kneel down and open her Bible and read one more time
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.800]   the Gospel of Luke right through, and then she would take her life. And she
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.960]   said that as she got to the end of the book and she saw Jesus in the garden,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:58.720]   agonizing with sweating drops of blood to be obedient for sinners and pay
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:09.040]   their complete price, God saved her soul and removed all doubt and gave her the
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   gift that Jesus is real and he has covered her sin. And she was standing
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   there ready to be baptized two days later. And I thought, "What a marvelous
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.520]   rescue." And he can do that, Becky. Here's the second story. Just this week, I was
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:37.360]   talking to a PhD in theology, asking to tell me his life story, and he told me
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.920]   that he grew up in a Christian home, and when he studied in the university, he
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.640]   threw it all away. He became a relativist, a postmodern, no truth, and lived like it
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:58.440]   for five years. And then he read, for whatever gracious reason, who knows, God
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   put him on to reading a book about the resurrection, and God persuaded him,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.560]   "Jesus really is raised from the dead. I can't escape this, and if Christ is raised
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.760]   from the dead, everything changes." And it did for him. And I said, "How do you
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   account for that?" And he got huge tears in his eyes. I had no idea he was gonna
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.200]   tear up in this conversation. Didn't seem like the person who would do that. And he
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   had no explanation except sheer intervention of divine grace. And the
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.960]   last story, quickly. In 1982, when I was two years into the pastorate, I was
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.520]   reading in Leadership magazine, and there was an article there, it's become iconic
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.020]   for many people. It was called "The War Within," and it was about bondage to
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:00.460]   sexual sin by a pastor, and how for ten years he was an absolute hypocrite. He
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:09.400]   would go to speak at spiritual retreats, and between sessions he would steal away
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:16.160]   and actually go to strip clubs. That's how serious the bondage was. And the
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:24.520]   article was about how he read a novel, and God used a novel about good and evil
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.980]   to open him up to the desire for purity like he'd never known, and this is the
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.960]   one sentence I remember, and maybe this will give some encouragement. He wrote
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:43.800]   this, "I cannot tell you why a prayer that has been prayed for ten years is
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:52.520]   answered on the one thousandth request when God has met it for the first nine
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:00.000]   hundred and ninety-nine with silence." And so Becky, you can read that article. I
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.760]   mean, it's a male-oriented article, but I just googled it,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:14.080]   "Leadership, War Within, Lust," and there it came up. Becky, God may surprise you. I'm
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.120]   praying that he will surprise you stunningly that a prayer you've prayed a
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:29.420]   thousand times will be answered on the one thousand and first time. I don't know
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.880]   why he has delayed, Becky. I don't have an answer for your question about why does
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:43.320]   God stay far away. I don't know why God's timing is the way it is. I just know
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:50.720]   you're not the first. You're not alone, and Jesus in fact told you a parable to
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.520]   the effect—this is Luke 18, 1—he told them a parable to the effect that they
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:05.320]   ought always to pray and not lose heart. So Becky, don't give up. Your answer may
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.940]   be just over the horizon. That is a great word. Thank you for this hope, Pastor John,
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.520]   and Becky, I pray that this episode will serve your soul in these few minutes
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   together. It's not uncommon for us to receive desperate emails like this one.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   If you want to reach out to us with a question that we can air on the podcast,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.920]   please email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. Well, tomorrow we
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.160]   return and we're going to talk about parents who feel that grandparents and
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.200]   seeking to spoil their grandkids are not serving those grandkids. What are parents
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.040]   and grandparents to do? There's a better way forward, and we'll hear from
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.000]   Grandfather John Piper on that tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.640]   listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
