[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   The following is a conversation with Arianna Huffington.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.260]   She's the founder of the Huffington Post in 2005
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.200]   and the founder and CEO of Thrive Global in 2016.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.160]   She's the author of 15 books,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.280]   most recent to being Thrive and Sleep Revolution,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.520]   both international bestsellers.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.660]   These books explore how to both work hard
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.600]   and keep a lifestyle that seeks well-being,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400]   wisdom and wonder.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.240]   We got a chance to sit down for this quick chat
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.400]   after a conference we both spoke at
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.480]   and got right into the big topics of mortality,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.280]   obsession, meaning, happiness and love.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.560]   This conversation is part of the Take It Uneasy podcast.

[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.200]   at Lex Friedman spelled F-R-I-D.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.040]   And now here's my conversation with Arianna Huffington.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.240]   You tell a story of getting recognition for your first book,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   The Female Woman, when you were 23 and sitting in a hotel
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.440]   and wondering is this all there is?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.080]   The old question of meaning and purpose.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.240]   So now, just a couple of few years later,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.840]   let me ask from your perspective now,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.760]   what is the purpose?
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.160]   What is the meaning of life?
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.320]   - Well, if you believe as every major philosophy
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   and every major spiritual tradition argues
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   that life does not end with death,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.840]   but that there is another dimension of consciousness,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.320]   then clearly a full life, a meaningful life
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.800]   includes exploring that dimension.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.700]   And for me, that exploration has been part of my life
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.160]   from my teenage years.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.600]   I went to Shantaniketan University in India
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.880]   when I was 17 to study comparative religion.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   And I always wanted to understand what life was about
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.040]   because I never believed that all this whole experiment
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.960]   ends with each individual death.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400]   So that's for me at the heart of my life.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.760]   I mean, I've always been very active with books,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.960]   with The Huffington Post, now with Thrive Global,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440]   but that's been an underlying dimension
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   that I think gives real meaning to life.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   - So mortality is a really interesting question
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   at the core of all of these philosophies.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880]   So you mentioned also memento mori,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.600]   the Latin remember death,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.240]   the idea that reflecting on one's own mortality
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.440]   puts things into perspective.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.280]   - Yes.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.080]   - In a tough question, perhaps, perhaps not,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.760]   do you often think about your own mortality
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.680]   and what perspective does that help you gain?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.400]   - Yes, I think about it a lot.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.080]   And it does give me perspective
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.400]   and it does help me focus on the things that matter to me
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.320]   in terms of my children, my close friends,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.480]   the impact I want to have through what we're doing at Thrive.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   I have zero interest in what is known as legacy
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.800]   because since I don't think life ends with death,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   I'm just much more interested in what happens to my soul
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   and then what happens to my legacy on earth.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   - Do you have a sense of what happens after you die,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.880]   of soul, is it more of a feeling
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   or do you have a more concrete sense spiritually?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.120]   How do you see the world or what happens to your soul
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   to whoever the heck you were while you were here on earth?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.380]   What does that become in time?
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.320]   - So my sense is that who we are, our personality,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.680]   the body, the mind is like a car that we rented
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.520]   and we return at the airport and get on a plane.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.840]   - And go to another city and rent another car?
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.480]   - No, well rent another car if you believe in reincarnation
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.000]   depending on where you are in your state of evolution.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.680]   But definitely that what survives is the soul.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.460]   And that's why how we live our lives
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.440]   and the choices we make and how we treat others
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.720]   is so central to what happens after our death.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.280]   - All of those elements you believe kind of feed the soul.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   - Yes.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.160]   - So you've also mentioned that
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.600]   on the harsh, challenging part of life
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   that failure is an essential part of life.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.520]   So what may be a major failure
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.800]   that stands out to you for yourself?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   One of the toughest ones for you psychologically
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.480]   to have bounced back from if you ever did bounce back from?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.440]   - Yes, well first of all, I don't think there is an if.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.200]   I don't think there is a single successful person
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   who has not failed along the way.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.240]   I mean, I challenge you to find one.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.040]   If you do, let me know.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.600]   But in my experience, everybody has failed along the way.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.640]   And I think it would be great
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.560]   if successful people talk more about their failures.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.920]   The difference is resilience
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.000]   and how quickly do you get discouraged.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.240]   In my case, actually, probably the hardest failure
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.800]   was when I was 28.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   And my second book, you mentioned my first book,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.280]   which did very well.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.960]   My second book, which was on the crisis
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   in political leadership in the West,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.840]   was rejected by 27 publishers,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.360]   you know, one after the other after the other.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.240]   And by that time, I had run out of money.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.400]   I had been living off the proceeds of my first book.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.560]   And I remember walking kind of depressed
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.200]   down St. James Street in London where I live
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.960]   and thinking, well, maybe my first book was just a fluke
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.880]   and I'm not really a writer and I have to go get a real job.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.560]   And then I saw Barclays Bank in the corner
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.080]   and I walked in and asked to see the manager
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   and asked the manager for what the Brits call an overdraft,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.560]   which is a loan.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.760]   And I had nothing, I had no assets.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.520]   And for some reason, the manager,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.800]   whose name is Ian Bell, gave it to me.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.520]   And that kind of changed my life
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.320]   because it made it possible for me to keep things together
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.400]   for another 13 rejections.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.120]   And at that point, I got an acceptance
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.480]   and I sent Ian Bell a holiday card every year.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.800]   And he's a little bit like, you know, in fairy tales,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.480]   when the hero or the heroine gets lost in a dark forest
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   and suddenly a helpful animal comes out
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.880]   and guides them out of the forest.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.000]   Well, sometimes helpful animals in our lives
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.480]   are in the form of a bank manager.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.680]   They take funny disguises.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.440]   - A modern fairy tale.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.520]   So I spoke with Elon Musk recently on the podcast
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.440]   and you've had a friendly exchange with him on Twitter
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.400]   last year about work hours and sleep.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.040]   So I, myself, as an engineer,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   I'm obsessed with the work I do.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.640]   I keep a schedule closer to one that Elon does, I would say.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.560]   Plus I'm Russian,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.840]   so I believe suffering is good for the soul.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.400]   So how does a singular obsession
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.480]   in the sort of the turmoil of innovation
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.920]   fit into a lifestyle you discuss and thrive?
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.640]   One focused on wellbeing, wisdom, and wonder.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.000]   So how do you score that with like singular obsession?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.120]   - Oh, I think singular obsessions are wonderful.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.400]   All my favorite people are addictive
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   and obsessive personalities.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.280]   But if you're obsessed about whatever it is
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.840]   you're looking to achieve,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.320]   whether it's in research or electric cars
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.220]   or going to the moon or anything,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.080]   you need to look at the science and the data
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.800]   that shows that you're going to be more creative
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.240]   and more productive and more likely
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.040]   to achieve the results of your obsession
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.880]   if you actually take some time to recharge.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.280]   That's really what we're talking about.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.180]   - So your senses, so science and data,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.040]   these things you talk about,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   are things of rational people.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.900]   So you think the impossible can be achieved
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.200]   by rational people or does madness play a role?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.120]   - Madness plays a role.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   But also looking at the results needs to play a role.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.360]   And listen, I have huge admiration for Elon Musk
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.040]   and I wrote the open letter to him with that in mind,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.000]   kind of lovingly and admiringly.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And helping him, I hope, look at the laws of human energy.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.640]   Because if you violate the laws of human energy,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.040]   it's like violating the laws of gravity.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.240]   There are consequences and he's facing the consequences.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   He's being distracted from his amazing obsession.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.000]   - And you think there's a way to do better?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.080]   - Absolutely, I mean, I think he should look
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.040]   at what happened.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.560]   The results of tweeting in the middle of the night
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.480]   because his cognitive impairment makes him do things
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.960]   which he knows he should not be doing.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.560]   And ending up having to step down as chairman,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.760]   pay 20 million, having to go to court to deal with the SEC.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.720]   Who needs that when you are building
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.320]   something amazing for humanity?
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.880]   - You think a more balanced sleep cycle?
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.560]   - It's not really about balance.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.080]   I hate that term.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.960]   Because I agree with you that
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.880]   there's no balance when you are trying
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.840]   to achieve something big.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.120]   I mean, there are times when I've pulled all-nighters.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.320]   There are times when people at Thrive
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.200]   have pulled all-nighters to ship a product.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.840]   In fact, we make that very clear when we hire people.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   We're not a nine to five operation
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.160]   where you just balance things.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.640]   But you need to, after that, take time to recharge.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.200]   And the faster you do it,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.800]   the more effective you're going to be.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   We call it Thrive time.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.440]   So let's say you pulled an all-nighter,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   take some time the next day to recharge
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   before your exhaustion becomes cumulative.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   Either you do stupid things or you fall sick,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.120]   or all the things that we are seeing around us.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.800]   - Catches up to you.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.120]   On another topic, you have evolved throughout the years,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.200]   your political views from, maybe you can correct me,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   but from right of center to left of center.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.400]   Can you take me through your journey of political thought
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.840]   and how you see the evolution
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.360]   of the greater political landscape
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.240]   along with your evolution
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.640]   throughout the last several decades?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   - So my evolution was from being a kind of Republican
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.000]   that's practically extinct now,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.640]   kind of pro-choice, pro-gay rights,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.800]   pro-gun control Republican.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.440]   (both laughing)
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   To someone who realized that my understanding
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.840]   of the role of government was limited.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.440]   I really was a Republican because I thought
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.200]   that the private sector would step up
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   and address inequalities and the need to take care of people
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   at the lower socioeconomically ranks.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.200]   And I saw firsthand this wasn't going to happen
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.000]   and that you needed the raw power
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.880]   of government appropriations to be able to achieve that.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.920]   So it was my shift in my understanding
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.960]   of the role of government
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.320]   that led to my shift in political views.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.080]   I think what's happening right now,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   we're at this moment when the chickens
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.720]   are coming home to roost.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   Like a lot of problems that we've seen coming,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.200]   that we've been discussing at endless conferences.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.360]   I don't know how many conferences I've been at
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.920]   with titles like inclusive capitalism,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.960]   the dangers of growing inequalities.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.920]   We talked about them,
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   but didn't really do anything about them.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.760]   And so the results are different forms of right-wing
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.960]   or left-wing populism.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.200]   And it's a very serious moment,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.680]   but I don't think it's going to be solved
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   by living in a perpetual state of outrage.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.880]   - So you've also launched this incredible platform
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.920]   in 2005 of Huffington Post,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   HuffPost as it's now called.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.080]   What impact do you think it had over the past 14 years
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.840]   on the nature of public discourse?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.640]   So if you look at what that discourse is today,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.200]   the divisiveness,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.720]   what impact does the digitization of our conversation,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   the online, of Twitter,
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   and then of more journalistic type of content
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.400]   like Huffington Post contains,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.760]   what do you think it has done for our discourse?
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.560]   Was it been a positive thing?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.520]   Was it been a catalyst for the divisiveness?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.440]   Or did it simply reveal the divisiveness
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.640]   that was latent there already?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   What do you think?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.040]   - Well, the Huffington Post
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.960]   helped democratize the conversation.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.440]   It helped elevate what blogging was.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.960]   When we launched the Huffington Post in 2005,
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.040]   blogging was dismissed as something
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.560]   that people who couldn't get a job
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.000]   were doing in their parents' basements.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.440]   And because we brought in people
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.720]   who could have written for the New York Times
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   like Walter Cronkite and Nora Ephron and Larry David,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.360]   we elevated the opportunity afforded to all of us
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   to express ourselves.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.720]   But we had very, very careful guidelines.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.440]   So for example, everything was curated.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.920]   We did not allow ad hominem comments.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.280]   At some point before I left the Huffington Post,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.680]   I even ended anonymous comments altogether
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.720]   because it was becoming too hard to police them.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.120]   So from the beginning,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.840]   I wanted to democratize the conversation
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.600]   side by side with investigative journalism
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.360]   and all the things that I loved and honored.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   But at the same time,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.200]   I saw the dangers of the toxicity
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.160]   that can infiltrate these conversations
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   if they're not monitored and if there is no real curation.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.240]   - So one of the core things
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.600]   that emerged from the Huffington Post is,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.120]   I mean, there is a little bit of a viewpoint
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.760]   underlying it, it is left of center.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.160]   - I don't call it left.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.120]   There's definitely a viewpoint.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   In fact, we called our journalism beyond right and left.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.920]   I think the right-left divisions,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.800]   the way of looking at the world in terms of right and left
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.840]   is incredibly obsolete.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:57.000]   Being concerned about growing inequalities
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.720]   is not a left-wing position.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   If you are somebody who cares about law and order,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.960]   you should care about that,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.880]   unless you want the country to be turned
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.680]   into a banana republic with rich people
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.520]   living behind gates with security guards.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.000]   If you care about climate change,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.720]   does that mean you're on the left
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.600]   or does it mean that you want to preserve the planet?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.640]   So I think by looking at the world in right or left,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.240]   we're simply polarizing the conversation.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.600]   - But, so that's a beautiful idea and I share it,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.920]   but nevertheless, it seems that
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.640]   there's a strong gravitational field
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.680]   that pulls people into left and right.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.600]   And no matter what,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.380]   they will place different venues into those polars.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.560]   So it seems that in the public perception,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.400]   Huffington Post kind of gets into the left
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.320]   and there's these opposing forces, Breitbart and so on,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.400]   that get placed somehow into the right.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.840]   And then there's the red team and the blue team.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.320]   I guess my question is, do you see, do you notice this?
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.360]   And do you see a path forward in the coming decade
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.400]   in the era of our current president
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.680]   of maybe bringing us back together
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.320]   and having a healthy disagreement on the issues
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.560]   as opposed to having teams and tribes of red and blue?
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.880]   - I absolutely do.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.040]   I think there are two things that are essential
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.320]   in order to achieve that.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.380]   One is a reverence for facts.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.540]   - Hmm.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.620]   - You and I have the right to our own opinions,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.460]   but we don't have the right to our own set of facts.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.300]   - Yes.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.580]   - So that's number one.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.580]   And number two is to end the view of journalists
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.620]   that Jay Rosen has described as the view from nowhere.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.620]   Like I think climate change is not a matter of opinion.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.960]   So a lot of journalists feel that their position
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.140]   is to have one person who thinks climate change is real
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.980]   and another person who thinks it's not,
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.860]   and their job is to stay in the middle
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.780]   and play Pontius Pilate.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.780]   To me, that's like not at all great journalism.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.500]   And the Huffington Post definitely had a viewpoint,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.340]   as you said.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.620]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.420]   - But it was a viewpoint based on facts.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.900]   - And I actually recommend that people listen
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.540]   to your podcast with especially conversation
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.500]   with Neil deGrasse Tyson that kind of emphasizes,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.900]   it talks about science and the importance
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   of that people have in terms of the seriousness
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.540]   amongst our leaders towards science
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.180]   as a thing that you shouldn't politicize.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.360]   Well, last question.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:49.900]   How do you balance love and ambition?
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.100]   Thinking about your work with Thrive,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.380]   this obsession towards whether it's building electric cars,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.620]   going to Mars, building Huffington Post,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.780]   obsession with your work life,
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.980]   and a genuine deep obsession with your family
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.060]   or people in your life that you love.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.900]   How do you balance that time and energy?
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.460]   - Well, let me give you an example.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:19.460]   Right now, Thrive Global is an obsession,
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.740]   ending the stress and burnout epidemic is our mission.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.900]   And I see it as having a huge impact on our health,
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.660]   on our mental health, and on our performance.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.660]   But at the same time, I have two daughters that I adore.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.660]   And everybody in my office knows that when I get a call
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.180]   from one of my daughters at any point, I will take it.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.020]   And that they are a priority.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.820]   That doesn't mean that I can't also be obsessed
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.100]   about what we're doing and our growth.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.460]   I think this is sort of false dichotomies
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.460]   because I think when we nurture the part of us
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.980]   that is about love, that is about connection,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.780]   we also nurture the deeper parts of our humanity.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.980]   And it's from those parts that wisdom and creativity come.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.900]   - So more love will strengthen all parts of your life
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.340]   and improve productivity in all aspects.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.180]   - Exactly.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.580]   And interestingly enough, Jack Ma,
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:33.180]   hardly a wilting violet in the obsession department,
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.180]   said in Davos last year that what's going to win the future
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   is not just IQ or even EQ, emotional intelligence,
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.040]   but LQ, the love quotient.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.700]   Which is something surprising coming from Jack Ma.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.300]   But I think it's part of the shift that's happening
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   where we recognize that while AI and machine learning
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.420]   are going to take over huge parts of our life
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.740]   and destroy many jobs, the things that AI
