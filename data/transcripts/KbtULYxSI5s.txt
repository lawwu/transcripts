[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   [music]
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.320]   All right. Well, speaking about easy, let's see how easy our
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   questions are this week. Jesse, what is our first call we have
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.800]   on the docket?
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.440]   All right, the first call is from Simon, and he references an
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.280]   article that you were a focus of, and it basically challenges
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.400]   some of your metrics of productivity.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.520]   Hi, Cal. Simon here. I'm calling from New Zealand. Recently, Alan
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.880]   Jacobs, philosopher Alan Jacobs, published a small bit of writing
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.040]   in the Hedgehog Review. The writing is called The Problem
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.520]   with Productivity and the Good Work of Love. And in it, he takes
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.200]   you to task a little bit in one of your New Yorker articles.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.880]   And just has some questions about the way you describe
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.680]   productivity and the metrics of productivity. And his questions
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.520]   are kind of about the way in which those people involved in
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280]   things that are less able to be quantified, how they fit in
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.560]   your, let's say, picture of the world. Would love to hear your
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.720]   response. Cheers.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.360]   Well, Simon, I went back and I read that article. I like the
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.040]   Hedgehog Review. This was an interesting piece, as you
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.200]   mentioned, by Alan Jacobs. He was talking about a piece I wrote
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.440]   for the New Yorker on productivity culture, people's
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   frustration with the notion of productivity, and what we should
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.760]   do about it. So there's a couple points in his piece, if I'm
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   remembering properly. Yeah, so part of this was just saying
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.760]   productivity is hard in a lot of contexts to even measure, like,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.800]   what do we even mean by productivity? And he felt that
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.560]   it's sort of the typical anti-neoliberal critique of this
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.000]   seems to, your language seems to quantify too systemic, too
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.680]   economically blinkered, I would say. Now, this is a, I think
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.360]   this is a common fault line right now in the discussion of
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440]   productivity and anti-productivity. So I would
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.960]   say the popular lane right now in elite discourses when talking
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.640]   about productivity, roughly speaking, falls into the club of
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   the post-capitalist, post-liberal types, where the
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.120]   big things to talk about is how just work itself, we need to
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.960]   rethink work itself, and this drive to produce and to define
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.240]   your life too much by work is a problem, and it's a sort of a
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.560]   necessary outcome of our capitalist systems, and can't we,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.480]   we need to rethink what work means and the role it plays in a
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   life and productivity discourses, typically it's
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.840]   influenced by like, Bayes superstructure theory,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.560]   productivity discourses are really just an opiate of a Zoom
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.440]   equipped bourgeois that is trying to coerce you into giving
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.280]   up more of your labor towards extracting value for the
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   capitalist, etc, etc. So there's a sort of post-capitalist thread
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.480]   that's really popular right now, in, I would say, left-leaning
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.080]   elite discourses, they don't like me. So they think I'm a
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   neoliberal shill, because I think while those are
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000]   interesting philosophical ideas, I'm much more boots on the
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.840]   ground pragmatic, these people at this company right now in
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   this job are stressed out and why and how can we change this
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.720]   company, so they're not so stressed out, like I like to get
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.480]   into the nuts and bolts about how knowledge work actually
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.440]   unfolds, and work in a much more narrow way of what can we do in
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   here pragmatically what's going on. So again, I'm often
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.720]   disparaged by that crowd as some sort of neoliberal shill,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   because I'm not, you know, appropriately having these naval
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.600]   gazing more philosophical grandiose theories about work
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.760]   and life and capitalism, etc, I'm much more narrow. So what
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.920]   I'm arguing about what I argued about in that article is
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.160]   actually something very specific, I'm saying here is
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.280]   let's get boots on the ground ethnographically, in the
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.880]   cubicles, seeing what is frustrating people. And this is
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   again, one of the things I think distinguishes my work, I have
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.320]   such a deeply embedded surveillance network into the
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.680]   world of work, because I have this decade plus career writing
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.160]   about this stuff, or I hear from people constantly. So I
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.600]   really have my finger on the pulse, like what's happening in
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.200]   these type of knowledge work jobs. And what I was pointing
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.520]   out is here is a specific pragmatic issue. We said
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   productivity should be personal, it's up to the
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.360]   individual to figure out how to manage their work and their
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.760]   workload. A necessary consequence of this is that in
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.320]   this informal, you have to figure it on your own type
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.360]   context, people became way overloaded, they have more work
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.240]   than they know how to handle. And it is a almost
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.600]   dehumanizing, cruel act to say, we're going to give you more
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.040]   work than you can handle and like figure it out, forcing you
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   into a position. So there's no sort of professional personal
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   Fifth Amendment here forcing you into a position of having
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.640]   to make these judgment calls between your personal life and
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   your work life. Because the more of your personal life you
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.760]   give up, the more work you can get done. They're just like,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.040]   hey, be productive, and it's up to you to figure out how to do
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.320]   it. And like, this is an untenable situation. We're
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.640]   overloaded, we were in this untenable situation where we
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.360]   have to figure out how to balance our professional lives
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.120]   and our personal lives. And the whole thing is a recipe for
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.560]   frustration and exhaustion, and people are getting fed up with
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   it. And so my argument is, we got to get this off of the
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   individuals. The structure and systems by which we actually
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.320]   figure out things like how much work should you have on your
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.720]   plate? How many projects should someone be working on? How do
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.760]   we communicate and talk about this work? These type of things
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.880]   need to be surfaced and made explicit. So A, it can prevent
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.240]   us from being in these terrible situations where we're
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   overloaded and are being implicitly pushed to just
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.520]   sacrifice more and more of other things that are important to us.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   And it makes it something that we can argue and fight back
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.600]   against. When you say this is how we assign work, and this is
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.160]   how we communicate about work. And if that system is onerous,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.000]   we can all point to that and say, this is an onerous system.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   We don't like this, do something better. It gives you something
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.560]   to push back on. You don't have any targets to push back on,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.720]   which is up to everyone, and work is informal, and we're all
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.560]   sitting back and forth, calendar invites and emailing. Surface
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.000]   and make explicit the systems by which work is assigned, how you
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.040]   collaborate on that work, how much should be on your plate.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.120]   And now we have something to push back on, now we have
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.320]   something to optimize. And now we can actually move past, I
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.440]   think, the excesses in terms of workload, the excesses in terms
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.040]   of sacrifice that our current knowledge work context creates.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   Now, this is like an intensely pragmatic thing. I'm talking
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.320]   about processes for communication and task boards
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   and push versus pull work allocation systems and what we
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.440]   can learn from just-in-time manufacturing and Kanban. None
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.960]   of this is sexy. It's much better to have a substack in a
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.640]   Twitter account and talk about the excesses of capitalism and
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.840]   how we have to, in the sort of the post-capitalist order, we'll
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   all just have, I guess, universal basic incomes and write
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.760]   poetry or whatever. And I'm not being fair to Jacobs, I'm
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.720]   obviously exaggerating here, and that's all fine. And I think
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.240]   it's good to have avant-garde philosophical critique because
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.640]   the avant-garde pulls forward the mainstream, and that's all
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.760]   good. But I'm not on the avant-garde. I like to think of
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.520]   myself more in the cubicle trenches. And so I think this
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.480]   is what I was talking about in that article. This is a core
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.720]   issue right now. It's very pragmatic. Implicit informal
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.200]   systems for work assignment, organization, and collaboration
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.840]   cause issues, and it frustrates and burns people out. So let's
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.200]   make them explicit. I think that's what Jacobs was taking
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.360]   me to task. He was like, "Well, but let's not talk about
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.800]   systems. That seems weird and corporate and capitalist. Let's
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.080]   not talk about systems. Let's not talk about trying to figure
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.760]   out what's more productive. Let's be very careful about the
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.640]   language we use." And I'm like, "That's fine." I think when I
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.720]   write for the Hedgehog Review, I'll be more careful about the
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.360]   appropriate language. But I think this is a concrete issue
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.960]   that I think real people have, and this is a concrete approach
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.240]   to actually solving those issues. I mean, let's get in the
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.920]   trenches and figure out why do you have 200 emails and are
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.200]   working on the weekend? And yes, we could stand back and say,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.760]   "Because of capitalism," but that's not going to fix this
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:37.160]   person's problem next week. And so again, I think both of these
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:44.400]   levels of analysis are important. I talk at my level. I
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.200]   think a lot of the elite discourses talk at another level.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.320]   Both are important. The avant-garde pulls forward. The
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   mainstream. And I also think debate is good. I think this is
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.000]   a useful article, and it's a well-written article. And I
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.040]   think Jacobs is very thoughtful. But there's a lot of other
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.120]   commentators out there where I think the anti-productivity
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.040]   discourse so easily just falls more into, "I want applause. I
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.840]   want applause for how radically critical I am and aren't I
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.400]   smart, and I hate capitalism. Subscribe to my sub stack
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.120]   because I want more money." Yeah, it's like this whole,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.320]   "It's fine, and I'm boring. And I think we get too many emails.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   I want to fix it." So I don't know if that's convincing,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   Simon, but I guess that's my off-the-cuff review. I mean,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.400]   Jesse, if you look at me, see, no one's ever going to
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.480]   associate with me. You just look at me and say, "You can't be a
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.840]   radical. You can't be avant-garde. You have a part in
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.120]   your hair." You know what I mean? So why even try? Why even
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   try? So I was like, "Let's talk about how we need more
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.480]   systematic work assignment policies." No one ever
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.880]   associates me with the word, "intellectually cool." If I did
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   like a beret and had a cigarette in a cigarette holder,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.800]   see, then we might be playing with fire. And if I was like,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.240]   "Here's the thing. Here's the thing." I need an accent, too.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.800]   "Here's the thing. You got to have another column on your
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.240]   Trello board for waiting to hear back." "Waiting to hear
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:30.960]   back" should be its own column. And then I just throw in some
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   of the post-liberal stuff, too. And do better. Zoom is the
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.400]   shackles of the bourgeois. French intellectuals are very
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.680]   cool. And we need to get rid of the capitalism. You do better.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.800]   But also, you should use Calendly when setting up your
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.080]   meetings because it's less email. See, what I'm going to
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.920]   do, I could mix them together. Like the really avant-garde
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:11.960]   philosophical stuff. Like, "As Edward Said taught us well, you
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.280]   should only use email for short questions and also do not
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.520]   other." So I'll mix in post-colonial theory plus my
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.360]   advice for scheduling deep work sessions. But see, no one would
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.080]   buy it from me. I'm not French. I don't have the right accent.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.200]   I'm not suitably angry. I have read all this stuff, by the
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.400]   way. I mean, I get it. I'm on a university campus. It's good
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.760]   stuff. I like the avant-garde.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.200]   The accent was solid.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.720]   It's solid? All right. Do the rest of the episode that way.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.560]   Do the ad reads that way?
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.000]   Yeah. They're not mad at us enough. Yeah. Why does this
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.360]   company even exist? It's just a stooge of the capitalist. The
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:03.400]   only company that I think should exist is, I don't know what
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.760]   company, the Hedgehog Review. The only sponsor we have for
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.480]   the show. And we paid them money. They're paying us. This
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   is a capitalist exchange. It is dirty. No. So we paid them
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:27.480]   money to be on the show as Foucault taught us. The power
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.000]   hierarchy that defines the modern podcast ad agency is
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.800]   itself a vestige of capitalist supremacy. So we could do it.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.160]   We could do it. Again, I've got a part of my haircut. I can't
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.520]   pull it off. I need a Shea t-shirt and shave my head,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   maybe. I don't know. Or I'll just continue to be kind of a
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.880]   dork. It's worked okay so far.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.760]   Having hair is a good thing.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   Having hair is a good thing. That's right. All right. So
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.360]   Simon, there you go. Let's do another call here.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   [MUSIC]
