[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.720]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.660]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited you're here today.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.000]   Our guest, Light Watkins, has over 15 years of experience
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.360]   as a meditation coach,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.000]   and is known for his unique approach to mindfulness,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.280]   making meditation accessible and relevant to people
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.960]   from all walks of life.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880]   He's written several books on the topic,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.940]   and for the past few years,
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.800]   he's been living out of a single backpack
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.240]   after giving away almost all his possessions,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.920]   including a laptop, which led him to develop a concept
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560]   called spiritual minimalism,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.720]   which he discusses in his new book, "Travel Light,"
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.520]   and is something I found far more fascinating
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.000]   the more I dug into it.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   So today, we're gonna talk a lot about meditation.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.800]   We're gonna break down some of the common misconceptions,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.280]   different methods to get started,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.720]   hacks to incorporate into your daily routine,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.620]   benefits and science behind it all, and a lot more,
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.440]   but we'll also dive into travel, spiritual minimalism,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.720]   and plenty of other things.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.940]   I am really excited to get this conversation going
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.800]   and share all of these topics with you,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.960]   Light, thank you for being here.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.800]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.240]   I'm excited to be here on all the hacks.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.000]   - Yeah, so I wanna start the conversation
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.440]   in the meditation arena,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.200]   because it's where I first came across you,
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   and it seems like everyone I know, myself included,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   have taken our own invitation to try meditation.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.640]   We've started it, and so few people I know
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.220]   have done it consistently,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.280]   and I think you have a little bit of a contrarian view here.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.840]   Let's just start, what are people getting wrong
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.120]   when they think about starting meditating?
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.160]   - Oh, man, so many things.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.720]   Just a little context.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.920]   I consider myself to be a meditation dabbler
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.200]   for several years, so I was one of those people.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840]   You know, I would start, and then I would stop
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   for a long stretch of time, and come back to it,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.760]   and to pick it up again, and then just do it
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.360]   for a week or two, and then stop,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   and then I met a teacher in Los Angeles in 2003,
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.960]   who gave me what I now recognize
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   as a more minimalist approach to meditation,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.680]   and what I realized was that I was just doing way too much.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.200]   I was doing too much, and that was one of the reasons
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   why I was having so many clunky experiences,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.580]   and I was labeling my mind as a monkey mind,
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.260]   and so I would say one of the biggest misconceptions
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.960]   is that you need to do all these things.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.200]   You need to let go of this, and notice that,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960]   and witness your thoughts like clouds in the sky,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.000]   and focus on your breath, and vision the white light,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.260]   and you don't need to do any of that stuff.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.160]   In fact, it works a lot better, and when I say better,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   I mean you have more delightful experiences
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.460]   if you do less, and then if you do least,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.800]   and ultimately, if you can do nothing,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.680]   and just practice pure being, that's when it works the best,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.640]   so I learned how to do that.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000]   I learned how to operate in concert with my thinking mind,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.720]   and that was a big game changer for me.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.520]   It literally made me an enthusiastic daily meditator
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.260]   within a couple of days, and before that,
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.360]   I was probably one of the most reluctant meditators,
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.960]   'cause I just felt like my mind was all over the place.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.920]   I was sitting there with my eyes closed,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.260]   waiting for the time to pass.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.380]   My body was writhing in pain.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.720]   It just felt like torture,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.140]   and then it would feel like dessert, and it was amazing,
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140]   and I recognized that I wanted to be on this mission
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.120]   to help introduce as many people as possible to this feeling.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   You don't have to be somewhere laid out
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.800]   with an eye mask on in the middle of nowhere.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   It's like you bring that serenity
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.920]   from that experience wherever you are,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.200]   so you can have that experience in the back of an Uber.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   You can have it on an airplane.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.640]   You can have it in your aunt's living room.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.920]   You can have it in your office chair,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.560]   wherever you happen to be sitting,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.000]   and you have the ability to close your eyes
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   for 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.480]   you can drop right into that experience,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.600]   and that's the power of that shift
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   I experienced in meditation,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.000]   and I'm excited to introduce
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.680]   as many people as possible to that,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.880]   and all the books I've written
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.280]   have been about exposing those misconceptions,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   and my most recent book, "Travel Light," same thing.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.480]   It's just like this bare-bones, minimalist approach,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.880]   stripping away things that I consider to be unnecessary
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.400]   for having that particular experience.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.520]   - And what does the science say?
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.240]   When you strip all that stuff away,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.200]   do you have the same impact on your life
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.800]   and the same outcomes?
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.640]   - You know, it's interesting.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.600]   The science, actually,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320]   there's been a lot of people studying meditation recently,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.160]   okay?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   The godfather of meditation research
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.960]   is this guy named Dr. Herbert Benson.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.360]   He's a Harvard cardiologist.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   He studied the stress response for many, many years.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.840]   He was one of Walter Cannon's protégés.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.240]   Walter Cannon was the professor
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.920]   who coined the term fight-flight reaction at Harvard.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.520]   And Benson was tracked down by these meditators
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.000]   from the local Cambridge Transcendental Meditation Center,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.520]   'cause no one had ever really studied it properly,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   and this is like in the late 1960s, early 1970s,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.640]   and he dismissed them.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.400]   He said, "No, I'm not studying you guys,"
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.800]   because back then, studying something like meditation
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.680]   would be akin to studying spirit animals now.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.600]   Like, no serious professor is gonna bring in people
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.400]   who claim to have a spirit animal
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.120]   into the laboratory and study them.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.320]   But they kept coming back, they were persistent,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.720]   and eventually, he figured he had nothing to lose.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.920]   And when he connected them
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.840]   to all the different measuring devices,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.880]   he was shocked by what he saw.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.760]   He basically, again, this is somebody
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   who was probably one of the world's experts
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360]   in the fight-or-flight reaction.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.280]   He saw that everything that happens
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.560]   in the fight-or-flight reaction
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   goes in the opposite direction
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   during what he later coined as the relaxation response.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.960]   He's the one that came up
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.880]   with the term relaxation response.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.600]   He wrote a New York Times bestselling book
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   about the effects of meditation
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.600]   called "The Relaxation Response."
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.280]   And the reason why his research is relevant to this day
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   is because back then,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.160]   they could test anything they wanted to.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.000]   Nowadays, you can only test one or two things,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.920]   and there's gotta be time apart,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.280]   and you can't stick rectal thermometers up in the people
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.920]   and do all these kind of invasive measurements.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.160]   Well, he was able to do everything.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.680]   It was completely unrestricted.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   It was free-range.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.480]   And so, he's got the most thorough results
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.680]   of anyone who's ever tested meditation.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.760]   And so, the relaxation response,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.560]   according to his research,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.680]   gets triggered by three essential things.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.320]   Number one, you have to be sitting comfortably, right?
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   So, we think about meditation,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.400]   and we think about it as someone sitting with their, what,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.960]   back straight, shoulders back, chin up,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   ideally with your legs crossed,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.560]   maybe even with your fingers together.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.440]   That's the sort of classical posture for meditation.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.800]   But to trigger this response that he saw
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.440]   where you go in the opposite direction of the fight-or-flight,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.760]   you have to actually sit with back support.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.320]   You don't need to cross your legs.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.400]   You don't need to hold your shoulders back.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.240]   Even your chin can be dropping forward
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.320]   as though it looks like you're falling asleep,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.520]   but that's not actually what's happening.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.200]   Then, he said, you need a passive attitude,
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.640]   passive attitude, which means the opposite of focus.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.000]   Focus is an active attitude.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.440]   You're trying to exclude experiences.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.400]   You're trying to exclude the noise, the distracting thoughts,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.760]   the distracting sensations, right?
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   And you're supposed to be thinking
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   about the fact that you're meditating.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   Well, he said, don't do that.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.240]   Just let whatever your mind is thinking about
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.600]   come into the experience.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.200]   And then third, you want some sort of anchor point
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.040]   to come back to, whether it's your breath,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.200]   whether it's a mantra, whether it's a word, a sound,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   something that's actually soothing to you,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.360]   something that is sort of like your happy word or anchor.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.160]   And if you have the combination of those three things,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.000]   you can have the most profound experiences
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.400]   in the meditation.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.320]   And then if you continue exposing yourself to this state,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.200]   this relaxation response over and over and over,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.320]   eventually you can stabilize it.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.960]   Your body can stabilize it.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.640]   So this is another thing, another misconception
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   that people have about meditation
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.760]   is that I can just meditate every now and again
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.640]   and I'll still get the benefits from it.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.920]   But it doesn't work like that.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.600]   It's kind of like working out, right?
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.240]   Let's say you just worked out on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.840]   Are you going to get as strong working out twice a week
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.560]   as you would get working out five times a week?
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   It's still beneficial to work out twice a week
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.880]   versus not at all.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.680]   But if you want to stabilize the strength,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   if you want to cultivate it so that it's there all the time,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.560]   you need to do it more often.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600]   And the same applies to meditation.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   It needs to be a daily practice.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.120]   And that's because the main thing that's keeping you
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   from feeling fulfilled, happy, content, peaceful,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   that thing isn't taking any days off.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.160]   And that is the stress.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.560]   The stress is coming in every day.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.360]   The stress is like P90X or something.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.840]   It's like working on you every day.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.560]   So in order to counterbalance that,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.600]   you need to do the thing that is like kryptonite distress,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.760]   which is the meditation,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.480]   because the meditation supplies the body with biochemicals
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   that can dissolve the stress.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.800]   You need to do that every day.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.240]   - So I think for some people listening,
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.640]   the idea of, "Oh man, so if I want to get started with this,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.240]   I need to commit to a daily practice forever,"
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.560]   can be daunting.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.800]   But I know when you wrote "Blissmore,"
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.280]   you talked about how you could succeed in meditation
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.120]   without really trying.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.720]   So how can we break this down for someone
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.760]   that maybe feels like what you just said is overwhelming
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.640]   and will take a lot of work
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.560]   and maybe realize that it doesn't have to be that hard?
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.520]   - And I would go further and say it shouldn't be that.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.880]   You're not going to do it if it feels hard to do.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   We don't do things as humans,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.600]   we don't do anything that's hard to do on a consistent basis.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.720]   So we have to get meditation out of the chore category.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.520]   It's out of the "I have to" category
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.200]   into the "I get to" category.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.240]   'Cause last time I checked, people who are chain smokers,
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.680]   they don't need any willpower to smoke a cigarette.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.320]   Coffee drinkers don't need any willpower
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   to drink a cup of coffee in the morning.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.800]   Sugar addicts don't need a willpower
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.320]   to eat that muffin in the morning, right?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.960]   They get up and they are craving those experiences
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.480]   because they have conditioned their body
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.920]   to become effectively addicted to those experiences.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.040]   And guess what?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.920]   Meditation can get there as well.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.840]   So in order to get there,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.580]   you have to learn how to do it in a way
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.340]   that feels legitimately enjoyable.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.740]   Not that you're faking like it feels enjoyable,
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.820]   it has to literally feel like it's enjoyable.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.660]   And there's like a couple of things
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.660]   that people do to spoil the experience.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.400]   And one of those things is they treat their mind
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.760]   like a monkey mind.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.500]   You know that term monkey mind?
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   Which implies that your mind is exceptionally busy, right?
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.560]   Now, I don't wanna negate the idea
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.220]   that you have lots of thoughts.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.300]   I believe you when you say that your mind is very busy.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.860]   'Cause guess what?
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.900]   Everybody's mind is busy.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.540]   My mind is busy, my mind has all kinds of thoughts.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.540]   The problem is we think it's not supposed to happen.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.260]   We think that our mind is just supposed
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.940]   to just automatically stop having all these thoughts
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.620]   the moment we close our eyes.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.420]   And that's not the case.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.340]   The mind is gonna have thoughts
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.140]   in the same way that the ocean is gonna be wavy.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.660]   We know water is wavy and the mind thinks.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.140]   And so what we need to do is understand
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.700]   how to move around in concert
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.800]   with the thinking mind during meditation
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.440]   in the same way that you learn how to swim.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.940]   When you learn how to swim,
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.300]   the wavy water is no longer an issue.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.980]   In fact, it's quite enjoyable.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.740]   If you don't know how to swim, then it's a nightmare.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.020]   The water is a nightmare.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.300]   The same water that someone else is enjoying for you
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.740]   is a nightmare 'cause it's gonna potentially drown you.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.340]   And guess what?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.660]   You increase the chances of the water drowning you
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.220]   by doing too much.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.060]   The person who knows how to swim does less
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.020]   and they can just like actually float there
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.180]   by doing nothing.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.300]   By doing nothing, the water will actually support you.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.380]   You'll float.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.580]   By trying to move and fight the water, you drown yourself.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.140]   Same is true with the mind.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.140]   By doing too much, the thoughts start to drown you.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.500]   By doing less, you can actually move through your mind
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.740]   in a very gradual way.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.900]   And the more you can embrace the thinking mind,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.680]   and in fact, you can get to the point,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.300]   you're celebrating it.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.700]   And what I mean by that is not that you're sitting there
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   imagining yourself at a mind party or anything like that,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.380]   but you're just understanding that this is a legitimate
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.900]   a part of the experience and it's a necessary part
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.340]   in order for you to reach that state of depth
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.460]   that you ultimately want to get to.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.580]   And what you'll find is that by adopting this added,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.300]   this genuine attitude of nonchalance,
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.740]   the thoughts start to become fewer and fewer,
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.340]   the mind settles more and more,
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.900]   and eventually you can drop into a state
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.900]   where you're no longer aware that you're even thinking.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.940]   Now, when you're in that state,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.220]   literally there's no awareness.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.380]   You never know you're there while you're there
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.940]   'cause thinking that, oh, I'm here,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.780]   that means you're not there anymore.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.380]   So it's through this mechanism
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.060]   of using your nonchalant attitude
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.580]   to kind of steer your way back into that state,
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.300]   you keep losing awareness.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.220]   For people who think, oh, no, that's not possible,
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.820]   I'm giving you an experience that you've already had
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   to show you that it is indeed possible
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.260]   because you've already experienced it, okay?
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.420]   Everybody has had the experience of sitting on their couch
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.820]   or sitting on their bed, and it's late at night,
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.860]   and you're trying to read a book
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.660]   or you're trying to watch a television show,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.820]   and then time goes by,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.620]   and you're stuck on this one line in the book,
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.100]   or large portions of the show have passed,
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.500]   and you don't remember what happened, right?
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   There was a gap in your awareness,
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.180]   but you don't remember sleeping,
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.620]   you also don't remember reading or watching the show.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.540]   So where were you?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.620]   You're in this other state, this other state,
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.620]   and that loss of awareness
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.380]   is symptomatic of a transition of consciousness.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.020]   You're actually about to move away
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.780]   from your waking consciousness,
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.460]   which is where you were aware of what you're reading,
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.620]   into your sleeping consciousness.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.540]   And anytime there's a shift in your consciousness state,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.860]   there's a loss of awareness.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.580]   And that relaxation response that I referred to earlier,
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.860]   Herbert Benson's work,
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.340]   he identified that as a fourth state of consciousness.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.140]   There's the sleeping state, which we all have,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.860]   the dreaming state, the waking state,
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.460]   and now we have the meditation state, the fourth state.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.620]   And so when you're going into the fourth state,
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.740]   there's a loss of awareness,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.140]   and it's consistent with the same thing you experience
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.460]   going from waking to dreaming to sleeping
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.780]   and back to waking.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.500]   - Okay, so with that example,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.540]   I can recall a situation like that
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.580]   as recently as I think last night.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.020]   For me, it's if I'm really tired
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.260]   and I'm reading my daughter a book,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.620]   every now and then,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.260]   I'll notice that I just read a line of the book
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.780]   that wasn't in the book.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.300]   I just made something random up non-intentionally,
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.220]   and I'm like, I don't know where that came from.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.660]   Obviously, I wasn't sleeping 'cause I was reading,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.620]   but I didn't read what was on the page.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.100]   - I feel like I might be late to the game with this,
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.300]   but I'll share it anyways.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.580]   So earlier this year,
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.260]   I got sick and felt incredibly dehydrated.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.640]   Instead of just drinking water,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.460]   I decided to try Element,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.840]   which is an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.340]   and has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.660]   That means a lot of salt with no sugar.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.020]   It was so amazing
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.820]   that not only do we keep it in the kitchen all the time now,
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.860]   but I also reached out to them to work together,
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.260]   and now I am so excited
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.300]   they're a sponsor for today's episode.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.460]   Honestly, I can't believe I never realized
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.660]   the importance of replenishing electrolytes,
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.180]   whether it's after a few cocktails, working out,
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.860]   or you just wanna keep up with an active lifestyle.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.700]   And it makes sense
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.500]   because some common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.820]   include headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue,
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.180]   and sleeplessness.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.780]   So when it came to how to get those electrolytes,
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.420]   Element was an easy choice
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   because there's no sugar, no coloring,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.020]   no artificial ingredients,
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.620]   and on top of that, it tastes so good.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.320]   My favorite is Lemon Habanero,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.260]   but you don't have to take my word for it.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.900]   You can try it out risk-free
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.220]   because Element has a no-questions-asked refund policy.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.980]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.220]   with any purchase.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.220]   That's eight single-serving packs free
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.700]   with any Element order.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.860]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.180]   or share Element with a salty friend.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.340]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/lmnt.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.340]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.740]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, L-M-N-T.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.580]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day,
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.140]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.040]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.140]   for this episode.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.340]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.000]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.540]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.340]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.420]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.260]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.960]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.500]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.020]   And it's not just for men.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.420]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.060]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.500]   I think I have three pairs of them,
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.000]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.060]   I've ever owned.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.860]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.940]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.860]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.020]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.260]   or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.220]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.540]   And for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.020]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.100]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i,
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.860]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.260]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.380]   - Okay, so you've sold me.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.180]   What process would you walk someone through
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.740]   or method to try this out?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.340]   If someone listening is like, "Okay, can I start this?"
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.420]   How would you get them going?
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.260]   - It's not too dissimilar from what Herbert Benson described.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.980]   You sit comfortably, you close your eyes.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.940]   And when I say sit comfortably, I mean sitting upright.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.180]   You can lean back on something,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.020]   but you need to sit.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.980]   This is not a practice you do lying down.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.300]   You sit upright, you're comfortable.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.940]   You lean back on something for back support.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.860]   You close your eyes.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.340]   And immediately, you're gonna get hit
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.660]   with a wave of thoughts.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.740]   Now you're in the water, okay?
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.060]   If you just treat your thoughts like you're in water,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.340]   and the idea is not to fight the thoughts at all,
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.860]   not even a little bit.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.260]   Don't judge them.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.940]   Don't shame yourself for having them.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.340]   Don't think that you have too many or too little
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.660]   or anything like that.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.820]   It's just like just going into water.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.540]   Sometimes it's a little bit cold or it's warm
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.340]   or it's a little choppy or there's an undercurrent.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.980]   You may notice the quality of the thoughts,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.980]   but you're not even trying to do that.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.300]   It's just a natural inclination
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.420]   when we are moving into a body of water, right?
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.660]   So same thing with meditation.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.580]   You may notice the texture of your thoughts
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.980]   or the color or the quality of the thoughts,
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.820]   but there's no judgment around the idea
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.020]   that you're in this body of thinking.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   And you give yourself some time
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.620]   to just kind of acclimate, right?
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.340]   Eyes closed.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.220]   And then you just start to literally do less.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.780]   You start to literally do less.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.540]   You start to just shift away from the tendency
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.020]   to control the experience,
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.460]   which is what we all have in the beginning,
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.180]   to this idea that, okay, well, I'm just gonna enjoy it
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.820]   for whatever it is.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.060]   I don't have any expectation.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.060]   I don't have any anticipation of any kind of result.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.540]   And you have some sort of timing device
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.940]   that you're using to track how much time has gone by.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.740]   And whatever you said you were gonna sit for 10 minutes
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.700]   or 15 minutes, you just have that experience
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.980]   and then keep peeking at the clock
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.580]   whenever you are curious about the clock.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.340]   No judgment around how much time is passing.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.740]   And then eventually you'll see that 10 or 15 minutes
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.300]   have passed and then you slowly come out.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.020]   And I mean, I break all this down in my book, "Travel Light."
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.340]   There's a whole 10-step process,
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.620]   but that's essentially what it is.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.020]   If you wanna use your breathing as a sort of anchor point
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.700]   to come back to, if you are aware that you're meditating,
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.460]   but you're just thinking about taxes
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.900]   or you're just thinking about dinner or something like that,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.780]   you come back to your breathing.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.620]   But guess what?
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.500]   You go right back to your dinner thoughts
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.260]   or your to-do lists, and that's fine too.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.820]   It's not about trying to keep that stuff away.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   It's about seeing that all as a part of the experience.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.300]   So most of it is just your attitude,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.180]   really, at the end of the day.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.220]   - Let's say you're sitting down and you're thinking,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.340]   "Dinner, ah, what am I gonna make for dinner?"
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.300]   Would you try to encourage someone to maybe say,
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.620]   "I can think about that later,"
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.780]   or just, "Think about it.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.260]   "Think what you're gonna make for dinner.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.380]   "Make the mental grocery list of what you need to buy."
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.020]   Or, "Acknowledge that you're having that thought
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.980]   "and that you can come back to it."
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.700]   They seem like two paths you could take.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.300]   - Okay, this is an interesting point.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.420]   When you say, "Come back to it," right?
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.460]   Where are you going to go when you say, "Come back to it?"
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.700]   Okay, I'm gonna come back to this thought.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.700]   Where are you gonna go?
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.540]   Some other thought about something else.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.380]   So you may as well just indulge yourself.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.700]   This is a practice of indulgence.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.820]   Indulge yourself in whatever's happening
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.820]   and just know that you can't screw it up, really.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.060]   So the more you practice this lack of resistance,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.700]   the deeper you will set yourself up
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.380]   to go in the meditation.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.820]   And eventually, again, as you go deeper,
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.820]   just like when you were reading the book to your child,
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.100]   you're never gonna know the part
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.860]   where you drop off the abyss and you lose that awareness.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.380]   And if you look for it, it's not gonna happen.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.220]   You're sitting there going,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.140]   "Okay, I wanna lose awareness now.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.220]   "When am I gonna lose awareness?
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.820]   "I can't wait to lose awareness."
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.700]   You're gonna be aware the whole time.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.220]   So you legitimately want to be just indulgent
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.540]   in whatever you're thinking about.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.180]   And then without even realizing it,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.020]   you'll drop off, the time will start going by faster,
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.180]   and the experience will feel really good.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.540]   And you'll be one of those meditators
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.540]   that you don't want the time to end.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.380]   Now, the beauty of that is when you come out, guess what?
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.980]   You'll have a more orderly thinking
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.820]   because the mind has this beautiful way
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.740]   of organizing the things that are most important,
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.860]   second most important, third most important.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.140]   You'll start to make connections
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.780]   between things that seem to be unrelated.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.660]   You'll start to spot themes in your life,
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.820]   which will allow you to then prioritize
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.860]   what you should be doing now
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.580]   versus what you thought you should have been doing.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.780]   For instance,
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.460]   "Oh, is it more important to send this email right now?
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.220]   "Or is it more important to spend time with my kid
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.980]   "reading my story?"
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.780]   A lot of people are confused about that.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.900]   And a lot of people may say,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.300]   "Oh, the email is more important."
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.420]   Or, "Spending time with my kid is more important."
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   And it's not to say that spending time with your kid
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.060]   is always the most important thing.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.140]   Sometimes I can imagine scenarios
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.100]   where sending that email is more important
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.660]   or you won't have a house to read a story to your kid,
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.780]   but you have to be able to discern that
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.540]   without putting too much thought into it.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.380]   Because as I talk about in "Travel Light,"
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.060]   the heart voice is your internal GPS
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.380]   that a lot of times we'll hear, but we'll ignore
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.340]   in ways that we would never ignore
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.460]   our actual GPS in our phones
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.980]   when we're trying to get somewhere.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.620]   It'd be ridiculous to ignore it.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.380]   Every now and again, we do it 'cause it just,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.420]   no, this can't be the right turn.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.420]   We ignore it.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.340]   And then what does it do?
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.780]   It reroutes so that we still end up at the destination.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.580]   We just take a little bit of a scenic route.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.180]   And so the heart voice does the same thing.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.900]   You can't really screw up.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.220]   You just end up taking the scenic route sometimes,
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.460]   but it'll always guide you on what to do next
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.540]   if you're listening to it.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.100]   - Any tips for paying attention to it or prioritizing it?
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   I think sometimes we all know what we wanna be doing
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.380]   and we're not doing it.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.820]   - In the book, I liken this to sports,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.660]   like a basketball arena, right?
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.660]   So you have the players on the floor, that's you.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.380]   And then you have all of the fans
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.620]   and those are the voices in your head.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.260]   And so the heart voice,
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.620]   which is also known as the still small voice,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.460]   the heart voice is usually up in the nosebleeds.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.380]   And down on the floor seats, you have the fear voice,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.260]   the voice of social conditioning,
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.500]   the voice of your parents and teachers and coaches,
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.260]   the news, right?
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.020]   All the voices that you've listened to the most
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.500]   in your life.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.900]   And so those are the voices that the player,
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.820]   you would hear the loudest in your awareness,
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.180]   not even just in meditation, but in life in general.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.660]   And the still small voice,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.020]   they're shouting as loud as they can,
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   but you can barely hear them just because of proximity.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.620]   It's so far away because we haven't been listening
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.500]   to that still small voice.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.060]   The still small voice is the one that's telling us
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.380]   to do the right thing, to stop looking for shortcuts,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.700]   (laughs)
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.540]   to go the extra mile, right?
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.540]   Somebody said there's never a traffic jam on the extra mile
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.740]   'cause so few people take it.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.660]   And this is basically reminding us
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.340]   that there is no way to happiness, happiness is a way.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.100]   All the cliches, give what you wanna receive,
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.180]   there's no throwaway moments in life.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.140]   All these cliches,
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.060]   that's what the still small voice is reminding us of always.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.500]   And when we start listening to it more and more
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.420]   and acting upon it,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.220]   then effectively we move them out of the nosebleeds
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.100]   and down to the floor seats.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.660]   And that's where we want them to be.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.740]   We don't want them to be a still small voice.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.940]   We want them to be a loud, annoying voice,
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.940]   like the floor seat people,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.980]   because that way it's harder to ignore it.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.220]   And what you'll find is the more you listen to it,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.260]   A, it's gonna take you out of your comfort zone
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.580]   more often than not,
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.660]   but you're always gonna be at the right place
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.660]   and at the right time for you.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.980]   Everything that's wonderful in your life,
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.940]   the best stories you have usually are describing moments
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.940]   where you listen to that voice,
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.580]   where something told you to dot, dot, dot,
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.220]   and you did it and this amazing thing happened.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.700]   And that's the thing you now talk about on podcasts
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.460]   and you write about in your books
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.140]   and you make movies and songs and choreographed dances about
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.100]   because that's what the heart does.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.940]   It always takes us on this little adventure.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.340]   Whereas not listening to the heart is what creates drama.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.340]   So you're either creating adventure in your life
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.260]   by listening to it,
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.020]   or you're creating drama in your life by ignoring it.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.660]   There is no neutral path.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.140]   It's either adventure or drama.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.820]   And if you look at drama,
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.060]   you could always reverse engineer it back to a moment
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.940]   where you ignored your heart.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.780]   - Interesting.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.780]   I know one other thing you've talked about,
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.220]   just finding ways to create more of those moments
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.180]   where they become stories you tell,
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.740]   is just being more present.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.900]   Any tricks for either being more present
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.740]   or getting other people you're around to also do that?
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.780]   - Good luck with that.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.780]   Let's start with you.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.580]   It's hard enough to get you present.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.780]   But the one hack I would use for getting present
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.460]   is you have to become radically grateful,
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.780]   become radically grateful.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.740]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.820]   is you have to be really intentional
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.740]   about finding as many things as possible
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.460]   that you can be grateful for in this moment.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.100]   There's this guy named Brad Lee.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.980]   He's big on social media.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.740]   He uses this one example that I just love.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.500]   He says, "If I were to give you $10 million
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:18.100]   "just as a gift, how would you feel about that?
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.420]   "If I just gave you $10 million."
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.940]   And then of course the person he's talking to says,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.340]   "I feel amazing, that'd be great if I had $10 million."
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.420]   Okay, what if there was a catch?
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.020]   And the one catch is you can't wake up tomorrow.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.140]   Would you still be excited about that $10 million?
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.060]   Would you still take it?
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.100]   And everyone would say, "No, I wouldn't take it.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.340]   "If I couldn't wake up tomorrow, no."
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.380]   He says, "So what you're saying is just by waking up,
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.700]   "it's the equivalent of someone giving you $10 million.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.780]   "When you wake up in the morning, are you grateful
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.060]   "like somebody just gave you $10 million?"
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.620]   Obviously the answer is no,
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.460]   because we take that for granted.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.420]   But if we ran that thought experiment,
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.500]   we'd all say the same thing.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.220]   We'd love to have $10 million,
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.180]   but not if it means we can't wake up in the morning.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.220]   So right off the bat,
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.620]   that's something you can be grateful for.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.740]   I woke up today.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.140]   I woke up today, I have all these opportunities,
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.100]   all these possibilities.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.580]   I can breathe, I can taste, I can smell,
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.620]   I can see, I can feel, I can walk, I can run.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.380]   You can just go down the list
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.860]   and just start thinking of all the things
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.860]   that you're grateful for.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.740]   I saw a guy here in Mexico City the other day.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.580]   I was just walking down the street with a buddy of mine.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.940]   This guy was on crutches and he was tethered to this dolly
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.060]   where he was carrying all this crap.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.220]   And he was like in the middle of the street,
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.060]   stumbling his way down the street.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.900]   One of his legs was like disfigured.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.740]   I was like, man, that guy would give anything
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.700]   to just be able to walk normally
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.580]   and not have to rely on these crutches.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.540]   And here we are walking,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.220]   just completely taking it for granted.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.620]   And I just dropped into gratitude in that moment.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.900]   You can't see it for yourself
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.860]   when you see other people
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.220]   who don't have the same blessings that you have.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.140]   Hopefully, you know, use that as an opportunity
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.340]   to remind yourself how blessed you are.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.420]   If you're huffing and puffing 'cause the elevator's out
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.300]   and you just walked up three flights of stairs,
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.140]   there's somebody out there
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.940]   that's not that far away from you right now
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.660]   that would give anything to be able to walk up
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.580]   those three flights of stairs, right?
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.900]   If your television is not working 'cause the cable's out,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.260]   but you can see there's somebody out there
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.340]   that's not far from you that would give anything
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.580]   to be able to see that the television doesn't work.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.860]   So, you know, just radically dropping into gratitude
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.740]   will get you right into that present moment.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.140]   And then from the present moment,
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.660]   you'll be able to see other things,
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.740]   other opportunities that are hiding all around you.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.780]   And it's kind of like those magic eye puzzles,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.100]   you know, those magic eye puzzles,
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.740]   that those patterns that if you--
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.100]   - I was never good at those.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.220]   - Yeah, some people aren't
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.620]   because you're always trying to find the thing.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.900]   But if you just surrender to it
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.340]   and you just allow it to be as chaotic as it wants to be
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.540]   without trying to control it,
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.700]   that's the condition that needs to happen.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.300]   It's not that it's a suggestion.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.420]   It needs to happen in order for the image to be revealed.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.340]   And so life can be like that too.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.460]   The more you surrender to what is happening
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.500]   instead of playing the woulda, coulda, shoulda game.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.060]   And that, again, that's presence.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.100]   That's a foundation of presence.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.340]   You'll start to see things and feel things
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.740]   that other people would not have an easy time
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.780]   seeing or experiencing
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.260]   because you really have to be connected to that moment
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.020]   in order to have that download, to have that epiphany.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.460]   And then every moment becomes special and sentimental.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.540]   And it's not just the old China set
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.140]   that your auntie's grandmother passed down
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.900]   sitting in the drawer somewhere collecting dust.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.940]   Everything is sentimental,
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.340]   just like that China set is sentimental
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.420]   because you're present.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.980]   So there's a relationship between presence
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.540]   and feeling that sense of connection
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.140]   with all of the things that are around you.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.940]   And that way, everything is special.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.300]   - And that doesn't mean you can't also
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.780]   have huge, big, ambitious projects at work
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.100]   and be excited and you just need to live in the moment
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.180]   and just accept that everything is what it is, right?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.660]   - All right, so I'll give you the difference
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.980]   in those two experiences.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.220]   There's two kinds of people out in the world, okay?
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.620]   There's people who are looking for happiness
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.460]   on the other side of that project.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.020]   And there are people who are engaging in that project
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.740]   because they feel a sense of happiness inside,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.180]   because they feel a sense of fulfillment inside.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.660]   So they're informed by where to put that attention next.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.340]   And that project seems like a perfect outlet
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.060]   for what they already have.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.780]   In other words, they're not looking to get happier
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.260]   on the yonder side of that achievement.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.180]   And that's a big mistake that we oftentimes make
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.500]   is we think that the project or the achievement
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.980]   is going to lead to happiness.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.260]   And so we'll indulge ourselves in this project
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.900]   a lot of times at the expense of our health,
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.220]   at the expense of our relationships,
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.780]   at the expense of our connection to family,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.740]   because we think that, "Oh, I'm gonna make all this money
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.860]   "and then everybody's gonna be happy
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.740]   "once I become a multimillionaire."
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.460]   And oftentimes the opposite happens, right?
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.300]   Starting with you.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.500]   If that was true that achieving things
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.180]   would make you happier in a lasting way,
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.300]   then think about it.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.820]   You would still be as happy as you were
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.380]   the day you walked across the stage
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.940]   to get your high school diploma.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.300]   Remember that day, how happy you were?
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.780]   And the day you got your first real job?
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.660]   And the day you got the promotion?
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.620]   And the day you got your Tesla?
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.180]   And the day you moved into the nice house, right?
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.260]   There were these spikes of dopamine and joy and serotonin,
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.180]   but then after a week or a month,
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.300]   you settled back into wherever you were
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.540]   before you achieved the thing.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.540]   And that's kind of how it goes.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.460]   And so the whole spiritual perspective
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.580]   is that happiness is not found outside through achievements.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.580]   It's found inside through cultivating it
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.060]   with your inner work, practices like meditation,
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.500]   practices like gratitude,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.620]   feeling more present, more in the moment.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.100]   And if you do that,
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.500]   then not only are you gonna have the spike of joy,
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.460]   but it's gonna become stable at some point.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.260]   And it increases the baseline level of fulfillment,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.340]   contentedness, peace, and joy.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.940]   And the way you know it's happening
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.940]   is that you need less and less to feel content.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   You're able to let go of control more and more to be present.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.260]   So yeah, that's where you start to shift in the why,
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.380]   why you're doing the things that you're doing.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.300]   It's not to try to get happy, it's because you're happy.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.020]   That's why you took this job.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   That's why you dated this person.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.900]   That's why you're engaging in this particular project.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.300]   And everybody else on the outside may not understand.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.180]   Why did you give up being an investment banker
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.620]   to work at a homeless shelter, right?
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.740]   That's what felt aligned with the happiness
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.940]   that I have inside.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.100]   And that's how I wanted to contribute.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.780]   And so you were feeling like your soul was being sucked
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.940]   in the investment banking situation.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.020]   And in the homeless shelter, you're lit up inside.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.420]   And then what ends up happening
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.740]   is because you're so engaged and present
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.620]   in that homeless shelter position, somebody notices.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.620]   And then they tap you to become the head of social workers
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.940]   in that city, and then in that district,
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.100]   and then in that state.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.940]   And then next thing you know,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.860]   you're on some panel in the White House
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.940]   helping to engineer legislation around that work
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.380]   because you're the one that's obviously so engaged in it.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.420]   And that took a leap of faith away from something
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.380]   that you thought was the higher paying job,
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.940]   but actually compared to how it was making you feel inside,
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.300]   it was the lower paying job.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.420]   And the surface level, lower paying job
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.700]   was actually the higher paying job
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.660]   because it lit you up more.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.580]   And then it ultimately manifested
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.860]   in you making five times more
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.300]   'cause now you're a thought leader in that space.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.580]   You're on the keynote circuit.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.780]   You're writing books about it
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.940]   because you are so passionate about that work.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.460]   And that's what we need to understand
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.860]   is that again, the heart is already guiding you,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.460]   but it's always gonna take you out of your comfort zone
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.780]   and into your growth zone.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.020]   And that's exactly where you want to be
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.580]   because that's where you need to be
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.940]   in order to stretch into the potential
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.380]   to fulfill that vision that you have for yourself.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.420]   - I've even found that maybe the role
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.620]   at the homeless shelter in this example
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.740]   doesn't turn into the thing at the White House
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.580]   that's so much more lucrative for you,
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.820]   but maybe it puts you in the right state of mind
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.700]   to find another project that you start that becomes that.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.220]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.060]   I get it.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.780]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.660]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.740]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.660]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.620]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.540]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.340]   take care of the supplies.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.140]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.980]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.420]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.380]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.860]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.940]   that you got through another week.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.020]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.580]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.340]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.420]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.100]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.660]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.640]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.680]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.500]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.580]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.220]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.700]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.340]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.620]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.640]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.880]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.740]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.860]   and even listeners about identity theft
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.100]   and phishing scams causing so much pain and hassle.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.660]   And it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.020]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.480]   and protect our personal data.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.580]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.180]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.180]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.540]   When I first looked up our family,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.740]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there,
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.900]   but thankfully I started using Delete.me
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.540]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.540]   removed from the web.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.460]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.740]   for this episode.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.620]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.180]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.540]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.300]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.140]   and get that removed as well.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.900]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.540]   and on average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.300]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.380]   When I first signed up, I was actually skeptical
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.500]   about needing a service on an ongoing basis,
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.420]   but these data brokers are relentless.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.300]   And I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.140]   throughout the year.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.140]   So I love having a service that continuously sends me
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.340]   updated reports on all the removals
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.900]   they're doing in the background.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.100]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.180]   removed from the web, go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.620]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.620]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.220]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.700]   and supporting the show.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.540]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.900]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.660]   I spent a lot of time talking about money
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.940]   and there's this whole financial independence,
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.420]   retire early movement.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.300]   And what I've seen is that people who end up saving up
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.540]   enough money to retire,
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.280]   thinking they're never gonna do anything,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.580]   end up spending their time on things they love
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.900]   and then creating these second careers,
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.140]   which actually meant they probably could have retired per se
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.180]   in quotes a lot earlier because when you have the time
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.260]   and space to find things you're excited about
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.300]   and only work on those, very often, not always,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.100]   but very often they end up turning into things
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.740]   that can support you and your family
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.260]   in ways that you probably didn't imagine beforehand.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.420]   - Yeah, a hundred percent, man.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.220]   And you know, there's all roads lead to Rome.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.740]   All roads lead to your purpose.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.780]   You can't screw it up, actually.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.540]   So even if you stay in that investment banking job
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.020]   long enough, eventually it'll become so painful
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.060]   if it's not aligned.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.620]   Sometimes it's aligned.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.380]   You know, you end up, again, like somebody like Jamie Dimon
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.780]   and you're creating policy or at least influencing policy
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.260]   that could be bringing economic empowerment
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.620]   to certain communities and things like that.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.180]   Or you're writing about it or you're speaking about it.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.380]   But either way, you can't really go wrong.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.100]   My work is all about just awareness,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.140]   bringing more awareness to doing the things
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.420]   that you're doing.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.260]   And checking in and seeing if this feels aligned
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.420]   because I want all the listeners
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.980]   to have the adventurous route.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   I don't want you being in a hospital
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.580]   and you can't use half your body
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.060]   because you stayed in it too long
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.260]   and then it manifested physically.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.700]   And even that's a part of your purpose.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.900]   Maybe you'll end up writing about that, right?
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.020]   But that's not the more enjoyable path.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.260]   The more enjoyable path is the path of the unknown
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.540]   where you're choosing this consciously.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.460]   You're choosing, I'm gonna leave this
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.460]   and I'm gonna do this other thing
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.580]   because it lights me up inside.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.340]   I don't know how it's gonna turn out,
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:29.820]   but I'm trusting that it's going to lead me somewhere
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.660]   that is gonna allow me to become more useful.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.220]   So if retiring early lights me up inside,
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.660]   then that's gonna lead me somewhere
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.020]   that's gonna allow me to become more useful.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.420]   If continuing to work lights me up inside,
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.620]   then that's gonna lead me somewhere.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.140]   You know, if you're like the Picasso
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.060]   where Picasso isn't thinking about retiring from painting
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.860]   'cause he loves it so much.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.820]   So if your work is so close to your heart in that way,
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.540]   you're not thinking about when am I gonna retire, right?
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.100]   All you're thinking about is when can I go
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.980]   and keep creating and keep finding solutions.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.820]   So whatever path you're on,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.300]   you're gonna eventually arrive at the awareness
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.140]   that you've been on your purpose the entire time,
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.820]   that everything was preparing you.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.300]   - And what would you say to someone who's like,
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.020]   gosh, I know I'm not in the right thing.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.660]   I don't know what the alternative is.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.060]   They hate the investment banking job,
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.020]   but they don't have an alternative right now.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.700]   They don't have the thing that lights them up.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.180]   - So I'll tell you what they do have though.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.460]   They have curiosity about something.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.220]   And the reason why they may dismiss it
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.420]   is 'cause it doesn't make sense.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:35.260]   It doesn't align with whatever they think their thing is.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.900]   And I'll give you an example about this, okay?
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.180]   So I remember one time I was teaching meditation,
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.140]   which I've been doing for 15 plus years now.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.260]   I was teaching meditation in New York City,
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.420]   staying at an Airbnb.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.780]   And I'm thinking, you know, it's my dream job,
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.940]   and I just wanna get as many people as possible
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.780]   into these meditation trainings
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.380]   and expose people to this knowledge.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:02.580]   So I'm walking through Union Square one night,
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.260]   which is in the middle of Manhattan,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.100]   on my way back to my apartment after teaching a class.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.180]   Something tells me to go to Barnes and Noble,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.940]   which is at the north end of Union Square,
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.940]   and to get a Rubik's Cube and to learn how to solve it.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.780]   Just out of the blue.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.420]   Like again, it's 9.45 at night.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.900]   I get this intuitive hit.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.460]   And then immediately I started thinking,
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.220]   well, it's almost 10 o'clock.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.500]   They're probably closed.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.660]   I'm kinda tired.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.620]   Just wanna go home.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.660]   But again, I had been doing so much inner work
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.300]   that my still small voice
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.900]   now became the loud, annoying voice.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.620]   It was like, get your ass up in Barnes and Noble right now.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.300]   Get that Rubik's Cube, hurry up before they close.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.060]   So I'm like, okay, fine.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   So I go and I get the Rubik's Cube,
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.660]   'cause I spent a lot of time in that Barnes and Noble,
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.580]   so I knew where the toy section was
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.940]   and they had one Rubik's Cube left.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.700]   I paid for it.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.540]   I was like the last person in the checkout lane
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.940]   before they closed.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.340]   And I get home and my friend calls.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.900]   This is my friend who I talk to him about money
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.700]   and all that all the time and business strategy.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.900]   And he goes, what are you doing?
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.700]   And I said, I just got a Rubik's Cube
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.500]   and I'm learning how to solve it.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.780]   He goes, what?
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.940]   I said, yeah, I got a Rubik's Cube.
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.180]   He goes, what are you doing playing with the Rubik's?
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.220]   And he starts giving me all this litany of reasons
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.060]   why I need to put the Rubik's Cube aside
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:24.740]   and spend that energy on more productive things.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.180]   So this isn't the first time I bewildered my friends
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.060]   with my weird, quirky interests.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.340]   So I just kind of ignored it.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.620]   And I went on Google and I researched
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.460]   how do you solve a Rubik's Cube?
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.900]   'Cause I had no idea.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.780]   Turns out there's an algorithm to solving the Rubik's Cube.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.220]   And you just have to memorize this sequence
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.140]   and you can solve a cube.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.940]   I thought you had to be a genius to solve a Rubik's Cube.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.820]   It turns out that's not how it works.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.540]   So I started going through the sequence
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.820]   and mastering the terms.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.740]   And it took me about three days to finally learn
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.820]   how to solve the Rubik's Cube within a few minutes,
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.180]   which is the most amazing thing.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.500]   If you're ever on a New York subway
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.980]   and you pull out a Rubik's Cube and you start solving it,
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.820]   it's incredible.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.060]   People are like gawking at you
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.700]   'cause they think you're a genius,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.620]   but you're not a genius.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.700]   You just learned the sequence.
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.700]   So anyways, I'm bringing this Rubik's Cube
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.900]   with me everywhere I go now
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.500]   'cause it's like a little party trick.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.100]   And then it dawns on me one day
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.220]   that the way you solve a Rubik's Cube,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.460]   which is how everybody solves it,
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.540]   you solve it in rows.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.580]   You start with the bottom row, the middle row,
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.620]   then the top row, and then you do some more turns
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.220]   and the whole thing gets solved.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.300]   The way that works is very similar
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.340]   to the way meditation works.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.500]   It works essentially in levels.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.340]   So the base level is like rest gets restored,
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:49.340]   and then from there, your immune system comes back online,
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.420]   and then your reproduction system comes back online,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.180]   and then your hormonal balancing system,
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.140]   the endocrine system comes back online, et cetera.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.660]   And then the whole thing comes back into balance.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.060]   I never would have guessed that there was a connection
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.700]   between a Rubik's Cube and meditation.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.340]   I was so curious about it
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.620]   that I decided to make a video.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.420]   This is back in like 2006 or seven.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.820]   So there was this new website, newish website, YouTube,
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.420]   and I was like, I'm gonna do a YouTube video,
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.100]   my first YouTube video.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.340]   And I got my point and shoot camera.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.820]   There were no smartphones.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.260]   And I turned my living room in Venice, California
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.580]   into like a little makeshift studio.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.940]   I was like setting it up on shoe boxes and stuff.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.820]   Then I created this video
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.460]   where I demonstrated solving the Rubik's Cube,
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.860]   and then I had to learn how to put captions over it.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   And that video, I uploaded it, it went viral.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.660]   And people in the meditation community
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.700]   started sharing it like wildfire.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.860]   And guess what?
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.980]   More people came to learn meditation.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.580]   The thing that I wanted ultimately,
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:00.260]   my heart voice knew that that's what I wanted.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.140]   And it took me on this really beautiful,
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.860]   adventurous path to get the result that I was after
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.260]   that I never could have imagined in a million years.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.860]   The first step was to take your ass in Barnes & Noble
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.060]   and get that thing, get that Rubik's Cube,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.580]   and then spend a few days learning how to solve it,
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.660]   and then use it as a party trick,
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.220]   and then figure out how to make a YouTube video,
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.020]   figure out how to do captions, iMovie.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.140]   So the whole path took a lot of work.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.300]   It took a lot of focus.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.260]   It took a lot of saying no to things
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.900]   because I was working so intently on this project.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.220]   But the end result was I had this thing
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:41.060]   that was now driving people to learn how to meditate.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.660]   And that's how curiosity works.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.500]   You never know where it's gonna lead to.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   You just trust that if it's genuine and it's sincere,
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.380]   and your intentions are good,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.700]   and you follow through with it,
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.140]   and it's not harming anybody,
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.460]   it's gonna lead you to the place
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.340]   that you've always envisioned for yourself,
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.740]   but in the most unpredictable and amazing way possible.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.580]   - So the answer, I guess,
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.300]   is if you don't know what you should be doing,
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.140]   just follow the curiosity and see where it goes.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.420]   - Follow the curiosity.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.060]   That's the gateway to your purpose.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.020]   I say in the book,
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.780]   you don't have to ever worry about your purpose.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.340]   Just follow your curiosity and your purpose will find you.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.180]   - I love that.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.020]   - That's the hack.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.260]   That's the hack to finding your purpose
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.940]   is follow your curiosity relentlessly, no judgment.
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.180]   - And just see where it takes you.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.380]   You mentioned meditation a few times,
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.620]   and it brought me back to a few questions I didn't ask,
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.820]   and I wanna come back to because I think it's important.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.780]   I know a lot of people are thinking
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.420]   there's a lot of things I could do to make my life better.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.980]   I could start eating better.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.180]   I could start exercising.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.420]   I could be sleeping better.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.860]   How would you weigh those things, right?
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.780]   If someone's trying to decide they're not exercising now,
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.220]   they're not meditating, they're not sleeping well,
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.100]   all these things, how would you prioritize
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.420]   which one is the higher order impact on your life?
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.460]   - That's a great question.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.260]   Okay, so here's how you wanna look at it.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.020]   You need a key habit, okay?
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.300]   So let's say you choose exercise.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.860]   You decide I'm gonna go to the gym by clockwork every day.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.100]   Is going to the gym going to make you want
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.260]   to be kinder to your family?
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.320]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.420]   Is going to the gym gonna make you
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.700]   wanna sit down and meditate?
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.020]   Maybe not more than you did before, right?
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.260]   So then, okay, maybe I can eliminate the gym.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.620]   Okay, what about eating healthy?
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.060]   Is eating healthy gonna make me wanna go to the gym?
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.380]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.020]   Is it gonna make me wanna be nice to my family?
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:26.860]   I don't know.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.820]   Is it gonna make me want to be more purposeful in my life?
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.380]   So you can keep going down the list.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.300]   And what I've found is that actually meditation
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.340]   is probably one of the best key habits
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.940]   because it gets rid of that one thing
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.980]   that makes you not wanna go to the gym, which is stress.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.660]   That makes you not wanna eat healthy, which is stress.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.220]   That makes you not wanna be nice, which is stress.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.780]   That makes you not sleep well, which is stress.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.780]   So stress can be tied to most of the bad habits
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.460]   that we have in our lives.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.340]   When you can eliminate stress
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.580]   by exposing it to its kryptonite,
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.100]   it's not that meditation is the Superman.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.740]   Meditation will help manufacture endogenous chemicals
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.460]   such as serotonin, dopamine, and anandamine,
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.660]   and all the bliss chemicals, oxytocin,
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.700]   that melt stress away inside of the body.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.460]   And when you have a body that is freer of stress,
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.600]   then you naturally feel more inclined
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.660]   to do the other things that you know you want to do
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.260]   in order to have the best life possible.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.700]   The other thing about it,
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.660]   and this is potentially even more important,
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.740]   is that meditation is like Wonder Woman's lasso.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.660]   When she lassoes somebody,
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.420]   her superpower is that lasso forces them to tell the truth.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.500]   Meditation is like a truth serum.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.960]   It's really hard to bullshit yourself
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.740]   when you're meditating every day.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.620]   It's hard to lie to yourself about what you are gonna do,
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.940]   what you're not gonna do,
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.700]   and walk around pretending that things are the case
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.980]   when they're not the case.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.740]   And you find yourself having more moments of boldness,
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.900]   more honest conversations.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.620]   You're calling yourself out more about BSing yourself.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.280]   And that also plays a role in you forming good habits
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.580]   because you're now able to say,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.500]   okay, I know I'm not gonna wake up at six in the morning
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.040]   to work on my memoir,
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.820]   so maybe I need to institute some other sort of system
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.380]   that's going to put me in a better position to do that.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.880]   And maybe that requires getting some accountability.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.700]   Maybe I need to drop money on a coach
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.260]   'cause that's what I really pay attention to
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.540]   is when I spend money on something.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.040]   And so you do that, and that's your path, right?
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.100]   It's different for everybody,
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.500]   but I think the thing that's lacking for most of us
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.420]   is honesty.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.660]   We're lying to ourselves
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.200]   about what we think we're gonna do.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.220]   Our intentions are great.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.380]   We have the best of intentions.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.580]   It's just that we don't have any history of evidence
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.380]   that we're gonna actually do these things
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.300]   that we're telling ourselves we're gonna do.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.980]   And if we're honest with ourselves about that,
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.080]   then we can put ourselves in a better position,
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.700]   and there's a million ways to do that.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.860]   - Is there a length of time
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.060]   you think someone needs to, at a minimum,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.420]   kind of commit before they feel like
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   they might be able to check in and see some benefit?
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.220]   Obviously, if you just meditate one time for 15 minutes,
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:11.100]   you're not gonna see a ton of impact on your life.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.260]   - It's less about time
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.240]   and more about understanding what you're doing.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.200]   If you don't know what you're doing,
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.100]   even two minutes is gonna feel like a torture, a nightmare.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.380]   But if you know what you're doing,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.860]   20 minutes is not gonna be long enough.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.840]   You're gonna wanna go longer than 20.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.820]   So, provided that you know what you're doing,
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.860]   then you wanna do about minimum 10 minutes,
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.580]   maximum 20 minutes.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.580]   - How many days do you think
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.540]   someone should commit to doing this?
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.540]   I mean, I know you probably would say all of the days.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.020]   Is there a go for three weeks and see what happens,
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.840]   go for a month, go for a week?
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.600]   - You need to do 90 days in order for it to become a habit,
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.020]   in order for your body to get used to the chemicals
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.460]   being released during the meditation.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.180]   And then it becomes in the same category
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.780]   as coffee, cigarettes, sugar.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.860]   You don't have to plan it.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.500]   Your body will just naturally crave it
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.180]   and you'll rearrange your entire schedule to do it.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.700]   So, if you wanna give yourself that level of freedom,
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.900]   and it's a freedom.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.780]   You have to earn it, but it's a freedom.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.420]   That consistency leads to the freedom of,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.240]   oh, my body is craving this experience now.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.440]   So yeah, 90 days, three months.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.260]   - Okay, 10, 20 minutes a day.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.600]   - I would say 20 minutes a day for three months in a row,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.560]   and you will find yourself dependent on meditation.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.320]   - And you said a coach accountability.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.760]   Are there other ways that are maybe not
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.900]   as expensive as a coach?
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.740]   Could you have a friend?
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.760]   Could you have a partner?
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.960]   - You know those videos where it says,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.360]   if I lost everything,
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.240]   this is how I would rebuild my wealth.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   If I lost all of my experience in meditation,
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.760]   what I would do is I would get my book Bliss More,
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.560]   which is my how to succeed in meditation
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.840]   without really trying book.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.320]   I would read that book,
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   and I would listen to the audio of that book,
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.280]   which will be an investment of about 20 bucks,
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.360]   and I would do everything that that book tells me to do,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.200]   which is essentially to adopt that nonchalant attitude
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.100]   and to be consistent for 90 days.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.020]   And it helps, you know, there's all kinds of questions
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.720]   that everybody and their mother has had with meditation.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.360]   Should I be focusing my breath?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.400]   Should I use crystals?
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   Should I do it at this time?
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   Should I do it right before bed?
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.760]   Should I do it right after I eat?
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.640]   All those questions are answered in that book,
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.920]   and it'll give you the playbook
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.960]   for getting a practice started.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   And then once you start to get enough positive experiences,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.280]   maybe you wanna take it to the next level
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.640]   where you actually go and study with somebody.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.320]   - What gets unlocked at these levels
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.480]   when you start to study with someone else?
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.160]   Do you get more out of it?
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.800]   - Oh, 100%, yeah.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.640]   It's like learning how to swim from a book.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.720]   I mean, technically you can do it.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.080]   They'll tell you, okay, you need to torque your body here,
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.680]   you need to elongate, you need to move.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.760]   There's nothing like having a teacher watch you swim
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.400]   and give you real-time feedback
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.020]   and give you drills and answer your questions in real time.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.040]   So having that verification and validation
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.800]   of technique and form and experiences
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.800]   can really accelerate your enjoyability factor
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.440]   when it comes to meditation.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   Otherwise, you're kind of reinventing the wheel every day.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.560]   - Okay.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.160]   I think we covered a lot of things.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.480]   The one thing we didn't talk about,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.160]   which is funny 'cause I think travel
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.960]   is a very common theme of the show.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.800]   I love to travel.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.200]   We have whole episodes about places.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.360]   And one of the things that,
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.500]   as you were talking about purpose and happiness,
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.520]   it made me realize you only have a backpack.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.360]   I said that in the intro, but for people that don't know,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.120]   I don't mean you have a backpack.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.400]   I mean, all of your worldly possessions
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.000]   fit in a carry-on, a small backpack.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.800]   And I realized it's not that you thought
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.480]   getting rid of your possessions would make you happy.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.080]   It seems like you realize you're already happy without them.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.200]   Why have more?
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.720]   But talk a little bit about the transition
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.120]   to so few things and what that's unlocked for you.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.040]   - Yeah, people ask me,
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.160]   "When did you start becoming a minimalist?"
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.380]   And what they're expecting me to say is that,
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.400]   "Oh, I became minimalist on May 31st, 2018
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.220]   "when I moved out of my two-bedroom apartment
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.280]   "in Santa Monica and into my carry-on bag,"
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.680]   which was the first apartment I had was my carry-on bag.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.280]   And then a year later, I downsized into a backpack
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.080]   when I realized I had too much stuff.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.880]   But the real answer is I became a minimalist in 2003
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.860]   when I started taking my meditation practice seriously.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.400]   Because what that did was it helped me
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   to create internal space.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:24.040]   And it's the internal spaciousness, aka fulfillment,
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.740]   that genuine sense of fulfillment
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.320]   that allowed me to become more and more unattached
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.480]   to things going in the way that I thought
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.000]   that they should have gone in.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.360]   And if you think about it,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.240]   the listeners can run this thought experiment.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.880]   I want you to think about the last time you suffered,
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.960]   the last time you experienced suffering.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.800]   And let's just keep it really light.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.000]   Emotional suffering, okay?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.360]   Not like you got hit by a car, but just emotional suffering.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.440]   I guarantee you it was for one of two reasons.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.240]   Either something didn't happen in the way
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.280]   that you thought it should have happened,
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.840]   or it didn't happen in the time
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.040]   you thought it should have happened in.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.920]   So all suffering, not pain, but suffering,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.600]   which is the soundtrack on top of pain,
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.160]   all suffering leads back to some expectation.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.960]   And that expectation is tied to our past.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.760]   Because we've learned, we've been conditioned to believe
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.960]   that something needs to happen in this amount of time,
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.200]   or it needs to happen in this way.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.380]   And maybe we've experienced pain throughout the years,
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:30.000]   and it's helped to hardwire that expectation.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.680]   And if it doesn't happen today or tomorrow
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.520]   in the way that I think it should happen,
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.120]   then I'm having a bad day.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.440]   And that's what makes a bad day,
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   is a day that we can't adapt to change.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.720]   It's really that simple.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.740]   And a good day is a day where we may be experiencing
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.360]   lots of demands and lots of pressures,
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.520]   but we're moving through it.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.940]   We're navigating it successfully.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.640]   We're adapting to it.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.560]   And that feels good.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.680]   There's a feeling tone that comes from that.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.520]   When you have a day full of demands
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.560]   and you're just hitting every single one,
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.920]   you're moving through them, you're learning things,
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.440]   you're present, you're engaged.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.880]   And if you have a string of those kinds of days,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.280]   then that leads to a successful life.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.720]   Yeah, I'm talking about feeling tone now,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.440]   not like, oh, I have more money than the next person.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.760]   But you can have all the money in the world
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.200]   and still feel like a failure and still suffer.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.680]   Or you could be in a situation
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.680]   where you just have a modest amount of money,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.000]   but you've adapted to the changes
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.120]   in your relationship successfully.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.240]   You've adapted to the changes
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.160]   in your family dynamics successfully.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.280]   There was a storm in your area
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.760]   and something happened to your house.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.840]   You adapted to that successfully.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.360]   And every time you are able to successfully adapt
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.140]   to something, you get gifted with some insight,
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.280]   some perspective that allows you to help others,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.560]   to be more useful in the world.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.640]   So maybe you wrote something, you started a blog,
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.920]   you started a podcast, you helped people in some way.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.640]   And that comes with its own sense
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.800]   of gratification and fulfillment.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.760]   And so you keep that happening from all sides,
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.640]   and that's what a successful life is at the end of the day.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.300]   So obviously, practices like meditation are helpful for that
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.680]   because it allows you to just be more present.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.720]   But then it's not enough to just solve everything.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.480]   You still have to be the best version
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.960]   of you out in the world, whatever that looks like.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.360]   And you still have to be moving forward
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.120]   and progressing and growing and stretching
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.160]   into your potential.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.640]   And that's where you really get the biggest wins in life
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.760]   is when you're doing that not as a destination,
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.040]   but as a process.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.600]   - It's funny because I feel like almost anyone you talk to
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.680]   that practices minimalism in terms of material items,
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.880]   their answer seems to be, you should get rid of your things.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.080]   And yours is like, I haven't heard you once tell me
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.000]   that I should live out of a backpack.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.040]   It's more like that comes later after you figure out.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.680]   - Well, the backpack experience is my version
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.660]   of stretching into my potential.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.440]   So I'm not ever telling anybody else to do that.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.480]   But you have your version of that.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.560]   And your version of that may be starting the business,
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.040]   starting the podcast.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.520]   It may be starting the garden.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.720]   It may be volunteering at a homeless shelter.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.480]   It may be something that stretches you,
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.680]   something that's a little bit uncomfortable, right?
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.760]   And that's what the backpack thing was for me.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.840]   The idea of doing it, it was something that excited me,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.720]   but it also made me really uncomfortable.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.960]   I was in my mid forties when I made that decision.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.280]   I was childless and didn't have a relation.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.960]   I just broke it up from my girlfriend.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.840]   And I felt like I had all of the metrics
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.920]   that one would need.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.280]   I have my shit together.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.440]   I'm a good looking guy.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.400]   I'm tall.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.720]   I'm successful in my career.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.360]   I have a purpose, a passion.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.680]   I've got this beautiful apartment,
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.720]   10 minutes walking from the beach, under market value.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.000]   I've got money saved up.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.280]   I've got a supportive family,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.000]   strong connection to my parents.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.760]   I've got all the things,
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.840]   but I can't seem to get a relationship
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.520]   that makes me want to take it to the next level yet.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.080]   And I'm not getting any younger.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.760]   So it's like, I could have easily talked myself out of that
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.080]   and thought, you know, this is silly.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:57.920]   This is stupid.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.360]   Women aren't gonna be excited
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.680]   about some old ass dude who lives from a backpack.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.200]   That's not gonna make them want to get married
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.320]   and have kids.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.200]   So it was like flying in the face
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.120]   of the conventional wisdom,
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.440]   but that wasn't the instruction.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   The call from inside was,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.640]   now's the time to have this experience.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.880]   And I'm still in process.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.120]   I'm still not married.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.000]   I mean, I have relationships and stuff
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.840]   and those are wonderful,
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.000]   but we'll have to see how everything turns out.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.160]   But I've learned a long, long, long, long time ago
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.480]   that when you ignore that inner calling,
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.640]   things don't get better.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   Oftentimes they get worse.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.760]   And if we have more time,
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.480]   I could share some of those experiences with you.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   But when you do follow that inner calling relentlessly,
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.320]   things only ever get better.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.600]   You only ever win.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.760]   And when I say win,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.920]   I'm not talking about money,
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.200]   although that could be one of the symptoms.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.240]   You can sleep at night knowing that you did your best
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.040]   and you lived your life in alignment
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.000]   and integrity with your heart.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.040]   And that is the biggest win that I can imagine.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.880]   - I love that.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.480]   Are there any other topics or, I don't know,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.280]   tactics or optimizations throughout this that we missed?
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.120]   - Man, there's tons.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.360]   I feel like I included a lot in this book,
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.440]   specifically with things like working out.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.840]   - Let's give us one there.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.280]   - Well, working out is tough for even people
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.440]   who've been working out for their whole life, like myself.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.960]   I put myself in that category.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.520]   I didn't really look forward to going to the gym
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.080]   until I started taking the minimalist approach
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.480]   to working out.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.040]   And what that means is doing less,
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.600]   but doing it with a level of quality
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.160]   that left you wanting more.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.880]   And so instead of going to the gym
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.960]   and doing a whole hour-long regimen
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.000]   where you're supersetting this and that
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.920]   and doing this and finishing with that,
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.760]   I just do one exercise.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.560]   I do one.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.160]   There's like five to 10 lifts.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.000]   And I'm focusing on resistance training now
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.880]   because it's just important for maintaining muscle mass.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.720]   But there's like five to 10 lifts that you can do
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.360]   that basically hits the whole body
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.120]   over the course of doing those five to 10 lifts.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.200]   And so I've broken down my whole week
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.040]   in accordance to those lifts.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.400]   They call them compound lifts,
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.560]   which means they help you contract
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.280]   multiple parts of the body.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.760]   So for instance, squatting.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.000]   Squatting affects your legs, it affects your core,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.680]   and it affects your back.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.480]   So squatting is you standing underneath a bar
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.280]   on a squat rack and you just bending your knees
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.720]   and squatting down as much as is comfortable
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.920]   and coming back, pressing back up.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.160]   And so Thursdays are my squat day.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   So I do one exercise, five sets of five squats.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.600]   And I go for progressive overload,
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.400]   which means doing a little bit more each time.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.440]   And that's it, that's all I do.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.400]   So the whole workout takes me like 20 minutes
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.280]   and then I leave the gym.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.760]   Even if I want to do more, I leave the gym.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.040]   Then I come back on Friday and I do pull-ups.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.640]   And I'll do five sets of five weighted pull-ups.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.120]   And then I'll come back on Saturday and I'll do arms.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.000]   And like that, Mondays are bench presses
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.880]   and Tuesdays are dead lifts.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.280]   So I have something for each day.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.400]   And then what I do is I do affirmations
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.520]   instead of counting down reps.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.160]   Instead of going five, four, three, two, one,
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.880]   or one, two, three, four, five, I'll do an affirmation.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.280]   An affirmation is a positive saying
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.960]   that helps to integrate something
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.600]   that you want to experience in your life.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.200]   So for instance, you could say,
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.360]   I am perfect whole complete.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.680]   I am perfect whole complete, that's an affirmation.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.600]   I am perfect whole complete.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.560]   I need for nothing, right?
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:39.400]   In other words, you could also on the next set,
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.120]   do your wife, Jill is perfect whole complete.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.080]   And then your kids, Dan is perfect whole complete.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.640]   Jane is perfect whole, like that.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.760]   So it just gives you a different energy when you're lifting.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.160]   'Cause it's like, you got to finish the sentence.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.800]   So otherwise they're not gonna be perfect whole complete.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.960]   And at the same time,
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.680]   it's almost like the lifting becomes like a meditation
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.800]   or like a prayer for you.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.960]   And it's a different energy.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.680]   You know, it's a different way to bring excitement
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.120]   into the experience.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.280]   And you did something useful for other people.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.000]   So it just checks a lot of boxes,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.600]   which is what I mean by spiritual minimalism
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.760]   is doing more with less.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.360]   You could have counted numbers.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.760]   There's no harm in doing that.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.520]   But now you've got to still do your prayers.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.000]   You still got to do your affirmations.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.560]   You still got to do your meditation, all that.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.440]   But you can combine all that too
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.040]   and make it into this really beautiful special ritual
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.400]   that you get to enjoy.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.880]   So I have a lot of tips for that inside of the book,
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.960]   how to bring more of that meditative component
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.320]   into everything you're doing, even like walking.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.040]   Instead of just sitting there counting your steps,
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.800]   you'd make it into like more of a meditation as well.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.280]   - There were a lot of those in the book
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.120]   that I enjoyed reading.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.320]   There's some stuff on communication
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.920]   that I thought was really interesting.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.560]   And so I'm not gonna ask you all of them
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.200]   because anyone here can just go
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.960]   and check out the book as I did.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.600]   So before we wrap two things,
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.520]   one, I always like to ask people,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   especially people who live abroad,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.720]   if someone's coming to where you are in the world,
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.680]   there's a little bit of a detour from everything we've said,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.040]   but how would you recommend them spend a day or two,
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.520]   maybe with at least one or two specific things
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.120]   that you love in the city?
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.960]   - So this is great.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.560]   I'm in Mexico City.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.200]   First of all, if you live in the States,
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.920]   it's a very easy place to get to.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.120]   Most cities have direct flights to Mexico City.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.600]   And if you only have a day to spend in Mexico City,
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.120]   I would say to get yourself
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.080]   maybe an Airbnb in an area called La Condesa.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.200]   And in La Condesa,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.360]   they refer to it as like the bubble of Mexico City, right?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.640]   It's where a lot of the expats live.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.840]   And it's one of the most walkable areas.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.080]   And there's like a thousand cafes.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.800]   There's a bunch of little shops
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.920]   and there are central parks.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.120]   There's one park called Parque Mexico.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.960]   So I would just say just land in La Condesa somewhere,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.160]   anywhere, and just walk around
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.560]   and you can just kind of roam around
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.400]   and you can use Parque Mexico
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.040]   as your sort of central point of focus.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.800]   So if you get lost, look at your map on your phone
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.560]   and walk towards Parque Mexico.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.880]   And the closer you get to that park,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.640]   the more cafes, the more restaurants,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.480]   the more shops you're gonna see.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.160]   And it's a great place to just get lost
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.840]   and not have an agenda at all.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.760]   And everyone's out walking
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.280]   and there's these beautiful little paths
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.640]   that are tree-lined and tons of dogs
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.200]   if you're a dog lover.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.000]   And outdoor seating in these cafes.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.240]   It's a wonderful place just to kind of get lost
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.520]   and roam around.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.360]   And if you are a student of language,
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.360]   you can practice what little Spanish you may know
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.160]   with the vendors or whoever's around.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.560]   And you're gonna stumble upon some wonderful food
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.600]   and some really charming little shops
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.440]   and lots of street vendors and things like that.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.560]   Whatever you do, don't drink the tap water.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.920]   Don't brush your teeth with it.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.280]   Just use bottled water for that.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.800]   You can drink tap water at the restaurants
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.920]   'cause they filter it.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   - I will say, I think there's one actually
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.240]   right near the park.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.320]   I think that El Morro is a churrascaria,
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.960]   or churrea, I can't remember the way to pronounce it,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.760]   but they have amazing churros.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.680]   And I'll push you to give one recommendation
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.040]   if there's a place you'd like to eat
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.680]   if someone's looking for a snack.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.680]   - Place to eat here in Mexico City, I would say,
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.880]   all right, so it's a small little cafe,
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.440]   but they have a little something for everybody.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.440]   It's called Canopia, Canopia, C-A-N-O-P-I-A.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.240]   My friend Rocio runs it.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.800]   It's right in the heart of Condesa.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.600]   And it's a beautiful little place,
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.840]   really eclectic crowd.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.520]   They're open all day long.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.840]   It's like a nice little wine bar vibe at night.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.800]   It's a nice little sort of lunch/breakfast type of spot
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.640]   during the day.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.320]   So I would say check out Canopia.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.600]   - Love it, thank you.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.760]   Okay, we talked about the book, "Travel Light."
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.880]   It's out now.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.280]   By the time this comes out, check that out.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.560]   Bliss More for meditation, everything.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.160]   Where else can we send people?
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.360]   - You can find me on the socials @lightwatkins,
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.760]   and you can also find me at lightwatkins.com.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.600]   - And the podcast.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.200]   - Podcast is The Light Watkins Show.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.400]   So I would say the website, lightwatkins.com
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.240]   is the portal for everything that I'm doing.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.760]   The books, the podcast, the online community that I have,
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.080]   and everything else I'm doing, the retreats I'm doing.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:23.920]   - Awesome.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.920]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.160]   This is awesome.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.000]   - 100%.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.240]   I really enjoyed the conversation.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.440]   Thank you for having me.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.400]   - I really hope you guys enjoyed this episode.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.880]   By the time you are hearing this,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.120]   hopefully I've already gotten my meditation practice going,
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.240]   and I'm really excited to see if I can finally make it stick
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.440]   by making it feel like a lot less work.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.120]   Outside of that, I hope you all are enjoying your summer.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.360]   I'm so grateful that all of you are here listening
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.760]   and supporting the show.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.800]   I can't tell you how much it means to me.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.320]   If you have any questions or thoughts,
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.280]   please shoot me an email, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.760]   I love hearing from you.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.600]   And if you're one of the few who hasn't left a review
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.760]   on Spotify or Apple Podcasts, I would greatly appreciate it.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.840]   It means the world to me.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.040]   Thank you so much.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:06.880]   See you next week.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   (crickets chirping)
