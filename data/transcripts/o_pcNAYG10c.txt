[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.560]   OK, let's keep moving here.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.080]   Question number three is from TooMuchRest.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.480]   He asked, how do I come back to work
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.320]   after taking a lunch break?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.720]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.160]   It's easy to fall down distractive rabbit holes
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.920]   after lunch breaks.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.800]   I suffer from this too.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.200]   Three things I'd recommend, and I would combine
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.280]   all three of these things.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.520]   Number one, ritual, have a post-lunch ritual
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.200]   that you always do to prepare you to get back into work mode.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.760]   A walk works really good here.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.840]   I'm talking like five to 10 minutes.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.800]   But you do a certain walk or whatever
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   so that you are teaching your mind that this
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.760]   means we're shifting out of the much more wandering mindset
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.240]   that we're in when we're at lunch,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.080]   just thinking about things and reading things
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.680]   and watching things back into a work mindset.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.640]   Two, no email right after lunch.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.800]   No Slack either.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.520]   That just has to be a hard and fast rule.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   Do not start your first session after lunch going down
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   a context-switching rabbit hole, like,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.560]   let me see what's going on my inbox or what's going on
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   with Slack, because your mind will never--
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.040]   well, it'll get back to work mode,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.360]   but you're going to really slow it down.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.920]   And you've just added 45 minutes of wandering if you do that.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640]   So never, ever, ever start your first moments
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.320]   after a lunch break with email or Slack.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.800]   And then three, and this is critical,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   before lunch, figure out and set up
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.160]   what you're going to work on right after lunch.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   And again, it shouldn't be email.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.440]   It shouldn't be Slack.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.240]   So do email and Slack right before lunch.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.080]   So like, OK, I'm not missing something urgent.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.780]   And then set up.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.960]   I'm going to work on this report right after lunch.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.000]   Get it loaded up.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840]   Get it in Word.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.080]   Get the documents that you need to draw from.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.040]   Get that all loaded up.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.320]   Take a look at it, kind of, all right, I get it.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.240]   I see what's going on.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.400]   I've sort of swapped it in.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   I think I'm ready to go.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.200]   Good.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.160]   Let me go eat lunch.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   When I come back, it's all there.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.360]   It's all got prepped.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   And you can get right into work.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.680]   Those three things, I think, do those three things,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.040]   and you can tame lunch breaks.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.720]   My lunch break recommendation, by the way,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.540]   is read during your lunch breaks if you can.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.760]   It's great for your brain.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   It's a great time to get some reading in.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.120]   And it has a much more minimal impact
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.760]   on your cognitive energy for the remainder of the day,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.960]   as compared to what most people do,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   which is they open up the internet and their phones
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   and are basically saying, put it in my veins,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.800]   and just go frenetic crazy.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.340]   And then they're like, OK, time to go work on something deep.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.320]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.720]   Crossing off.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.660]   (upbeat music)
