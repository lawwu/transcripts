[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   I love this idea, or what you just said, that it doesn't even so much matter the direction
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.160]   as much as the commitment.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.920]   A colleague of mine at Stanford who I respect tremendously, Anna Lembke, who wrote the book
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.440]   Dopamine Nation, she's the head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Center.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.880]   She was the one who really, truly deserves credit for bringing dopamine into the public
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.320]   discussion over the last few years.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   She initiated that, talking about how big inflections in dopamine that are very fast,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.280]   that aren't preceded by effort, aka drugs of abuse, behavioral addictions, et cetera,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.600]   leave us below baseline with our dopamine.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440]   And then people will engage in more of the behavior, and it drives us further and further
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440]   and further.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.840]   That's kind of the principle of it.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.480]   I was talking to her about how people get sober, and the conversation turned to how
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.320]   do young people find their purpose.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.960]   It was very interesting.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.340]   She said, "Let's talk about finding purpose.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.440]   Everyone nowadays wants to know what their purpose is."
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.960]   She said, "The way you find your purpose is by going out onto your front lawn and seeing
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.760]   if the leaves need to be raked."
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.200]   Sounds familiar, right?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.460]   You find purpose by figuring out how you can be of use at progressively larger and larger
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.240]   spheres away from yourself.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   And in doing that-
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240]   And the present.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.480]   And in doing that, you start to hear the calling, and you find your purpose.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   And as you said, you don't-
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   Or it reveals itself to you.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040]   It reveals-
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.040]   And it's the same thing.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   Right.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   So I think you two would enjoy a conversation at some point.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640]   Well, this is an important thing to return to, because people are often curious about
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640]   what to do practically.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   It's like, okay, first, this is what Jacob does.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.640]   Jacob, in the Old Testament stories, he eventually becomes Israel, right?
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.200]   And so that's his name, and Israel means we who wrestle with God.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.280]   Now Jacob is a bad guy when the story starts, and he leaves his home, and the perverse influence
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.600]   of his mother, and his criminal, betraying past behind.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.120]   And he decides that he's going to aim up.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.760]   And that night he makes an altar, and he makes a sacrifice, and that night he has a dream
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.920]   of a staircase that reaches up to heaven, which is now what he's walking up, right?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:19.600]   And so he finds his purpose, he finds his adventure, as a consequence of his decision
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   to be better.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.040]   Okay, so now you want to find your purpose, okay.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.440]   First thing you have to do, you have to review how wretched and miserable you actually are,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.080]   and you have to face that.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.040]   And then you have to think, I'd rather not have that, and it has to be true.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.600]   And then you have to aim up.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.340]   Now you don't know what that means, because you're pretty scattered and dissolute, but
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.260]   at least you got the damn intent in mind.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.720]   And then you have to be willing to make the sacrifices, right, along the way.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   Okay, then what happens?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.200]   Well then, the pathway will reveal itself to you in increments.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   Calling?
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.320]   Is there something around here that I could fix, that I would fix?
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   That's a great question.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.960]   Is there something at hand that I could fix, that I would fix?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.520]   It might be something low, because especially when you first get going, you're not good
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   for anything.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.240]   So you might have to start with something pretty trivial, but it doesn't matter, because
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.640]   you start getting better.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.400]   Is there something that bothers me?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.480]   That's conscience, that I could set right in some small way.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.200]   Well, that's there for everyone, right?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   In the midst of the most catastrophic mess, that pathway, you might even say, look, the
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   more mess around you, the more unstructured possibility you have at hand.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920]   And it's true.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.880]   It's like, I'm not trying to be a Pollyanna about this.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.600]   I know how difficult that is, but it is the case that the more mess at hand that you can
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   see, the more opportunity that's there, because if you can see that it's a mess,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   then you can see the pathway to cleaning it up.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   So do it.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   Do it.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   See what happens.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   That's the adventure.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.800]   What's going to happen?
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.880]   In my class, my Maps of Meaning class, I used to have students do this as a project.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.560]   And one of the projects was, find something around you, in your neighborhood, wherever,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   in your family, that isn't set right, and see if you can set it right.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.720]   Just write down what happens.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.280]   Well, one student in particular, he decided his mother had died, and the family kind of
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.680]   fragmented.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   And so he decided he would try to take on the role of mother, be responsible for the
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.040]   household operating.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.280]   Well, it grew him up like mad, as you can imagine.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.600]   He ran into all sorts of weird resistances, because his family was upset that he was doing
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.440]   what mom used to do, and he just had a tremendously complex adventure as a consequence of his
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.640]   willingness to pursue this.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   It was obviously necessary, because the alternative was that his family was going to fall apart.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   That's there for everyone.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.600]   You say, well, my circumstances are so difficult.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.160]   It's like, fair enough.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.680]   So are everybody else's, by the way.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.760]   But that means there's a lot of mess.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   Fix it a bit.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   And that's ridiculously entertaining and unpredictable.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.240]   And that in itself is a great deal.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.160]   You have no idea what's going to happen.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.680]   Just like you didn't know what happened when you started the podcast.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.640]   Why did you start it?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:30.040]   For me, I felt a compulsion to share what I knew, but because during the pandemic, everyone
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.600]   was so focused on vaccines and lockdowns that no one was talking about the reality that
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.040]   everyone was facing, including, sorry, Josh Gordon, I know him through time, our director
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.880]   of the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   Not a single thing out there about, hey, folks, if you're going to be indoors this much, get
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.360]   some sunlight in your eyes in the morning, or else you're going to have trouble sleeping.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.080]   Trouble sleeping equates to mental health issues, stress, uncertainty.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.400]   My lab was working on ways to regulate stress through deliberate breathing, through other
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   mechanisms.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.920]   Well, I want people to have tools, zero cost tools to deal with their stress, to help them
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.960]   regulate their circadian biology, because those wick out to countering the negative
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.560]   forces that were on us, which are social order was disrupted.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   People are at home.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.280]   So it was a desire to give people tools that I knew existed, that I was knowledgeable about.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.040]   And I had a long standing kind of growing compulsion that I wanted to talk about neuroscience
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.680]   because it's so darn cool.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   Right.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   Okay.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   So there was a lot of energy behind the mission, but then there was a calling.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.200]   The calling was from hearing about people's suffering.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's like, well, of course you're not sleeping well.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.840]   I mean, not only are there a million things to worry about right now, people aren't working,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.400]   et cetera, but you're not getting sunlight in your eyes.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.440]   You need to get outside.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.360]   You need to, you know, and then there's the whole socialization thing and whatever people's
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.680]   circumstances, there are things that they could do.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.240]   And so I felt that calling and my conscience told me that I have the knowledge.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.640]   So why would I cloister with it at home?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.320]   It's like, what good is that?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.120]   So I just started blabbing on the internet.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120]   Right.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Right.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   That's why.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.360]   Well, that's a perfectly, you know, you can think, well, that's a logical extension of
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   your subsidiary calling to be a teacher and a professor.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   You're already a researcher.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   You're already a professor.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.400]   So you're investigating and transmitting knowledge like, well, looks like you could do that on
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.080]   a broader scale.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.360]   And the technology is there.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.320]   Why not explore that?
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   That's a perfectly reasonable, and you can see the interplay of calling and conscience
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   there.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.760]   That's a lovely way of characterizing the voice of the divine, which is how it's characterized,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   repeated.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   Elijah.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.320]   Elijah is the prophet who is, appears with Christ when he's transfigured on the mount
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   in the New Testament.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.920]   It's Elijah and Moses.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.800]   Elijah is the first person in human history who identifies the divine with conscience.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   That's his contribution.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   That's a major psychological revolution.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   Right.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.960]   It's an unheralded transformation in understanding.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.000]   It's like, it's not the storm, it's not the forest fire, it's not the earthquake, it's
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.280]   not the God of nature.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   He's the originator of the phrase, the still small voice.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   Right.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.920]   It's like, the notion that your conscience is the voice of the divine, my God, there's
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.040]   virtually no discovery.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.240]   There's no proposition more revolutionary than that.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.320]   And so that's why Elijah is a prophet of, you know, primary status.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.800]   And I just see no reason at all not to take that claim seriously.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.920]   It's like, you come up with an explanation for your conscience.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.680]   It tells you things you don't want to hear.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.160]   So how is that you?
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   I mean, you have to gerrymander the definition of you for that to be you.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   Right.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   Right.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   Right.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   Right.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   Right.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   Right.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   Right.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   Right.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.220]   you
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:03.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
