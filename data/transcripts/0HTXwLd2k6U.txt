[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Let's talk for a second about social freedom.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.000]   What does it mean and what can it do for your life
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   by having more of it?
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.400]   So the idea is you're free to be 100% you
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.160]   and do what you want in the world
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.520]   and not be restricted by the cultural field.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.200]   Obviously, you have constraints.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   There's laws.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.120]   There's things that don't feel good
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.500]   to your own personal ethics.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.540]   But most people are in a cage that's much tighter than that.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.720]   It's, oh, my mom told me I was bothering people
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.480]   when I was young, so I don't wanna bother people.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.520]   We have all hundreds of little conclusions
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.000]   and if/then statements of how we should be
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   in order to be good, lovable, worthwhile,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160]   attractive, all these things.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   And so we're operating in this cage
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.600]   that ultimately, though, it's not really you.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960]   And the kicker is you're actually more attractive,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.960]   more lovable when you step outside of that cage.
