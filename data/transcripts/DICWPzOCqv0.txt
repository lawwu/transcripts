[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:14.520]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.460]   where we had two weeks worth of questions building up.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.860]   Duncan and I today are thankful for the color purple.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.700]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.100]   Today's sponsor is Bird Dogs.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.180]   Duncan and I was in Detroit over the weekend,
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.720]   which they have an elite, elite holiday,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.880]   holiday decoration system there now.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.720]   It's great.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.540]   The kids love it there.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.080]   They had ice skating and slides.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.480]   And so John showed the thing here.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.860]   I was walking around trying to be comfortable.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.760]   So I was of course wearing Bird Dog joggers.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.060]   Now they have two different kinds.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.660]   One of them is kind of lightweight,
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380]   which is good for the summer, fall, spring time.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.700]   But they also have these heavier duty ones
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.300]   that are like sweats almost.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100]   And in the past, I probably would have worn jeans,
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.060]   but the Bird Dogs pants were great.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.100]   They're warm.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.740]   I was comfy walking around the city.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.660]   We're still giving away the,
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.180]   they're still giving away the Bird Dog white tech dad hat.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.860]   Promo code ATC.
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.680]   You still get this.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.020]   Duncan wants one so bad.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.740]   Birddogs.com/ATC or enter the code ATC.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.820]   - I gotta say, you look really fashionable in that photo.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.660]   - Not bad, right?
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.500]   - Yeah.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.320]   - I could be a Bird Dogs model.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.340]   Let's be honest here.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.260]   - I think that might be in your future.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.940]   Yeah, I think that might.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.700]   Very, very comfy.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060]   - So last week, did you miss the show enough
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.780]   that you were just having people ask you
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.540]   financial questions at the Thanksgiving table?
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.820]   - I did get a few finance questions from people at the table,
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.280]   but nothing special.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.180]   - Nothing as exciting as your Twitter exchanges?
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.300]   - Listen, all I'm trying to do
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.780]   is put a little good news into the world.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.000]   People can get bad news from anywhere, right?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.100]   The media likes to share bad news.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.140]   People on social media like to share bad news.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.980]   Every once in a while,
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.820]   I like to give some optimistic takes into the world.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.080]   And if there's one thing people hate more than anything
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.380]   on finance social media,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.180]   it's good news and long-term stock market returns.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.540]   They hate that stuff.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.480]   Hate it.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.320]   They push back.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.620]   So I'm just trying to, listen, I'm not naive.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.220]   I know that there's bad things in the economy.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.220]   People hate higher prices.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.740]   People hate inflation.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.020]   But there are some good things going on too.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.100]   We've got a strong labor market.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.380]   The economy continues to grow.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.580]   Housing prices are still up.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.060]   It's the stock market is almost back to all-time highs.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.020]   Come on.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.100]   - I mean, my biggest complaint,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.340]   I know the main point of Twitter
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.060]   is to hate on people essentially and to fight.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.340]   But if people are gonna come at you,
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.460]   they should at least have something original.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.460]   Half the time I'm looking, I'm like following the threads
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.000]   and people are saying the same thing
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.020]   that someone else already said and you refuted.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.260]   Like the one that I keep seeing
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.900]   is you were talking about the economy
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.720]   and everyone's saying,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.940]   "Well, yeah, what about credit card debt levels?"
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.780]   And you shared a chart that shows
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.880]   exactly what they're asking for.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.200]   And then like five other people ask you the same thing.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   What about credit card debt? - I'm used to it.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.040]   I'm Teflon dunking.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680]   It just bounces right off of me.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.360]   I have charts galore.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.200]   Keep coming at me, people.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   - I think people don't realize that you actually do enjoy it.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.460]   I think that's the- - I do.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.760]   I enjoy sharing good news when it's here.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.600]   And guess what?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.440]   When there's bad news, I'll share that too.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.080]   But right now I think the good outweighs the bad.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.920]   - Yeah.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.080]   - Let's do a question. - Let's do a good news.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.560]   - Okay.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.640]   Up first today, we have,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   I'm finding it incredibly hard to invest my excess cash
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   with the S&P 500 closing in on new highs.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.120]   I know I'm supposed to just grip my teeth and invest,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.460]   not try to predict the market,
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.800]   and take comfort in knowing that time in the market
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   is the biggest factor in my long-term investment success.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.480]   But it's so damn hard for me to do psychologically
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.560]   in these seemingly overbought conditions.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.440]   I'm not an idiot.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   I do max out my 401(k),
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   contribute a fair amount to 529s,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.100]   and even invest a bit into my brokerage account.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.000]   But I have money building up on the sidelines.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.720]   There's cash on the sidelines, who you guys talk about.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.160]   But I know I should do something with,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   and every day the market hits a new high,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.960]   I feel more paralyzed.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.660]   Would love to see you tackle this problem,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.280]   because I know I'm not the only one suffering
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   from this strange and yes, enviable malady.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.080]   - I'm glad we put problem in quotes here,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   because it is a first world problem.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.920]   I think for some investors, this will always be a problem.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.160]   The thing is, obviously, market timing is hard.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.320]   And the problem is, once you do it,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.120]   and the worst thing that can happen is you're right,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.180]   'cause it leads to a cash addiction.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.840]   So when markets are falling, and you're sitting in cash,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.320]   you just say, well, they're gonna fall even further,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   so I'm just gonna wait, so cash becomes a safety blanket.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.320]   And then when markets are rising, you go,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.400]   wait, well, I already missed it,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'm just gonna wait for it to crash,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.480]   and then cash becomes a safety blanket again.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.140]   I actually found an old email.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.720]   This investor, a number of years ago,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.320]   emailed me in like 2015, and said,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.440]   I went to cash in 1999, timed it perfectly, right?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.640]   That was the tail end of the dot-com bubble,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.160]   the most expensive the US stock market has ever been,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.240]   and the stock market crashed.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.300]   And then we came back after that bear market,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.780]   and then crashed again, of course, in 2008.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.800]   And unfortunately, 15 years later,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.740]   this investor was still sitting in cash.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.460]   And I wrote him and said,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.500]   what do you think the reasons are
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.220]   that you've been sitting in cash for so long?
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.000]   He said, well, it's some combination of fear, arrogance,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.060]   and then he latched onto this macro doom and gloom
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.460]   that just put him in the investment fetal position
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.220]   for a decade and a half.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.940]   And so it's like, obviously, market timing is hard,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.080]   'cause you've gotta be right twice.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.120]   You've gotta get out at the right time,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   then get back in at the right time.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.560]   But you also have to psychologically get over that hurdle
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   of wanting to get back in.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   And so I think there's a few ways to get around this fear.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.600]   I'll start with the more spreadsheet strategies,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.320]   and then get to more of the behavioral side of things,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.600]   'cause the behavioral is obviously the biggest part here.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.080]   Like, I view diversification and asset allocation
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.600]   as risk mitigation strategies.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   If everyone knew what the future was going to be,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   you wouldn't have to spread your bets.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280]   You would just put 100% of your portfolio into Oatly,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.200]   and you'd be fine, right?
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.840]   - Hey, Oatly's looking pretty good this week.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.800]   I have to say.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.640]   We joke a lot about my irresponsible position in Oatly,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.360]   but the last week's been good.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.200]   I'm still more than cut in half.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.840]   - Someone in the live, someone wanted to know
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.720]   how closely your portfolio would match ARK,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.120]   and they wanted to dunk it in there.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.400]   - For the record, I'm still more than cut in half
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.240]   in my position.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.320]   - So like, the whole idea behind setting
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.160]   an asset allocation in the first place
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   is that you're balancing out your various time horizons
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.000]   and risks as an investor, right?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.920]   You don't have one asset allocation for a bull market,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.520]   and one asset allocation for a bear market,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.200]   and then one asset allocation for inflation,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   and then deflation, and rising rates and falling rates.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.240]   You set an asset allocation that balances out
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   the different risks and needs in your portfolio,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.400]   and that's durable enough for any environment,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.000]   'cause you don't know what the environment's going to be.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.960]   So you have this mix of stocks, bonds, and cash,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   and maybe some other assets
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.160]   that you hold during any market environment.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.840]   So the first thing is, like, get an asset allocation,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.600]   and that should be true of both your current assets
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.560]   and then your contributions.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.800]   So you have that in place that you can,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   and maybe cash is one of those buckets too, right?
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.240]   Cash can be it, but I think you just have to,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.520]   have to think in that asset allocation framework.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.200]   And if you're worried about valuations
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.920]   for large cap stocks, like, we've talked about this.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.080]   We talked about this with Jeremy Schwartz a few weeks ago.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.880]   There's other asset classes you can invest in
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.600]   that look much, maybe more attractive.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.360]   Bonds have higher yields.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   International stocks, much cheaper.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   Small caps, much cheaper.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.360]   Dividend stocks, high quality stocks,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.440]   any of these other things.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.640]   There's other places you can invest
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.200]   besides large cap U.S. stocks.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.960]   You can diversify into other strategies and asset classes.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.520]   So I think it's also worth pointing out
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.600]   that new highs in the stock market
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.560]   are nothing to be afraid of.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.720]   John, give me a chart on here.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.280]   They happen quite a bit.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.880]   I used this one before from a couple weeks ago.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.720]   This is new all-time highs in the S&P by decade.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   You can see there's some decades where it happens less,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.760]   like the '70s and 2000s, but most decades,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.920]   like, you're gonna have to get used to it.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.480]   I think it's 8% of the time since 1950
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   we're hitting a new all-time high.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.920]   So, you know, roughly one out of every 12 or 13 trading days.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.280]   Sure, some of these all-time highs
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.920]   are going to lead to a peak and then a crash
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.600]   or a bear market, but most of them
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   simply lead to more all-time highs.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.040]   The other big piece is obviously defining your goals
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.880]   in the first place.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.560]   What are you investing this cash for?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.160]   The 401(k) is obviously for retirement.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.280]   The 529 is for your kid's college plans.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   Like, I think most people look at their investments
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.520]   in their portfolio and think,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   "My goal is to get a good return," right?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.800]   But like, the goal of investing is not alpha
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   or outperformance or a good sharp ratio or whatever.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.200]   It's like retirement or a trip to Hawaii
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.880]   or a second home or renovations or beach house
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.960]   or whatever it is, healthcare needs, rainy day.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.200]   So I think you have to kind of attach a goal to this
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.400]   and define what you're trying to get out of the future
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.280]   in the first place.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.160]   And I think another way of thinking about this,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.800]   we've talked about mental accounting before.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.680]   Remember we used the Dustin Hoffman example before.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   I think you can, even though it's one big pile of money,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.880]   you can separate it out by buckets, right?
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.280]   And you can have a long-term bucket,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.080]   which is stocks and retirement funds.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.240]   And then you can have an intermediate-term bucket
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   that maybe is more income-producing assets,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.200]   and then maybe a short-term bucket that includes cash.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.080]   But I think if you have a cash,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.660]   the way that I think about it is,
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.800]   you can have a percentage of cash over your portfolio,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.640]   or you can have a level.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.240]   And for me, my short-term savings, I have a level of cash.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.560]   And once my cash exceeds that level,
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.700]   I immediately sweep it out
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.880]   and put it into my investment accounts.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.100]   And I think that's what you can do too,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.320]   is put a ceiling on it.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.180]   And so have your rainy day fund in cash,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.480]   but then anything over and above a certain level,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.760]   sweep into your investment accounts and put it to work.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.720]   So of course, that's like the spreadsheet part of it.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.680]   That's easy on paper, hard to do in reality.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.600]   So the hard part is implementation.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   So that's why I think you just have to,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.480]   for most people, it's just automating.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.440]   Automate your contributions, automate your asset allocation,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.760]   automate your rebalancing, put it on the schedule,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.360]   and then just stop looking at your portfolio
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.400]   so much into thinking about it.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.840]   Like, what about valuations?
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.620]   Like, have an asset allocation, make it automatic,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.560]   and just, that's it.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.960]   I think that's the best way to avoid mistakes
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.240]   in your portfolio, is just like,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.360]   make good decisions ahead of time
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.960]   and get out of your own way.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.240]   'Cause obviously, those psychological barriers,
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   otherwise you're always gonna be
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.000]   second-guessing yourself and your moves.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   - Yeah, that sounds like good advice.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.560]   - But this is something that I constantly hear from people.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.800]   There was people who got out in 2008 or 2009
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.660]   and they just could not force themselves to get back in.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.200]   And you'd hear from 'em seven or eight years later
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.440]   after there's a bull market, and then they go,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.540]   what do I do now?
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.640]   And that's a really tough position to be in.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.040]   - Yeah, it's like what you and Michael
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.840]   were talking about on Animal Spirits,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.680]   being overly optimistic versus pessimistic.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.200]   And you were taking the side of saying
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.440]   you'd rather be overly optimistic.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.400]   'Cause yeah, I mean, this sounds like
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.880]   a tough situation to be in.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   When you're scared to actually do
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.680]   what you really kind of need to do.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.800]   - But also, being optimistic long-term is good,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.720]   but also build into your plan the fact that,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.080]   yes, there's gonna be short-term setbacks as well,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.520]   but don't build your whole plan
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.240]   on waiting for those setbacks to happen all the time,
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.560]   'cause that's really, really a tough stance to take.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.080]   I'm only going to invest when the market crashes,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.720]   because you constantly end up in a fetal position that way,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.400]   and waiting for things to get worse and worse,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.000]   and then you just never invest.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess being a dreamer,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.060]   we never run out of baked beans.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.440]   - This is true, in bullets.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.280]   All right, next question.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.080]   - Okay, that question was from Josh, by the way.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.920]   Up next, we have a question from Shale.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm probably mispronouncing that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.400]   "At a basic level, I understand the inverse relationship
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.380]   "between bond yields and prices,
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.480]   "but I can't wrap my head around
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.360]   "how this works with bond ETFs.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.040]   "If prices go down on the ETF,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.820]   "shouldn't the yield increase to compensate
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.600]   "so quarterly dividends are higher?
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.720]   "What am I misunderstanding?"
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.560]   - Fair question.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.520]   I know it can seem confusing,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.840]   because many bond funds have a relatively static maturity
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   or target duration,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.140]   but just remember a bond ETF or mutual fund
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.240]   is just a portfolio of individual bond securities.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   It's the same thing in many ways
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.420]   as holding an individual bond.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.940]   There just might be some more buying and selling
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.180]   as opposed to holding all the bonds to maturity.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.240]   So yes, as interest rates rise, prices go down,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.320]   which is bad for returns in the short run,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   but now those higher rates translate
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.000]   into higher bond yields,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.280]   making future returns more attractive.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.540]   So iShares was actually nice enough to provide us
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.180]   with a historical look over the last 10 years
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.400]   at their US aggregate bond ETF, the AG.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.760]   This is like a simple total bond fund.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.300]   So John, throw up the chart here.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.480]   This is the average yield to maturity in the AG
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.320]   going back 10 years.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.240]   You can see rates were pretty skippy there for a while,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.080]   obviously.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.240]   You got close to 4% in 2018,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.920]   and then of course right back down.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.980]   Then the pandemic hit,
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.120]   and we got all the way down to 1% by the end of 2020,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.640]   which was just all risks, no reward, more or less.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.360]   And now that yields have risen,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.380]   by the end of October,
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.640]   the average yield of maturity on the AG is more than 5.6%,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   which is great, right?
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.880]   But you've had to endure some losses to get there.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.800]   So John, show the next, throw the next one on.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.280]   This is the AG over the last three or four years
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.360]   from the, we're in like a three-year bear market.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.880]   It's down 13%, which stings,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.560]   but now you've got a yield north of 5%,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.540]   closing in on 6% to compensate you.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.300]   So you're just in a much better position
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.640]   regardless of where rates go from here.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.320]   So you had to endure some short-term pain
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.260]   of yields going up,
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.320]   but now your yields are higher,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.480]   and your future expected returns are much better.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.240]   So it stings to have those losses,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   but bond investors are in a pretty good place these days
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.680]   as far as yields go,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.880]   especially compared to the last 15 years or so.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.240]   - And now, I don't want to put words in your mouth,
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.360]   but you did say on yesterday's Animal Spirits
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.880]   that you think there's a 100% chance of a rate cut in 2024.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.440]   Is that what you said?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.260]   - What?
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.200]   I would never say, I wouldn't.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.640]   Probabilities is the next question.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   We're gonna talk about
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.840]   how you never say 100% for anything, Duncan.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.120]   I just said, I think there's going,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.960]   all right.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.920]   - That's right, you Grand Rapids hedge.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.160]   - Good segue into the next question
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.800]   because I think you never go 0% or 100% for anything.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.640]   That's realistic.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.960]   So let's do the next question.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.800]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Dave who says,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.600]   "I get that the future is unknowable,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.020]   "and you're supposed to think about it
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.560]   "in terms of probabilities,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.260]   "but how do all these economists come up
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.060]   "with their probabilities in the first place?
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.560]   "It seems like they all just say 40% as a hedge
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.040]   "so we never really know how much weight
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.280]   "to put on any outcome."
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.240]   - That's a really good question
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   because like you go to the casino,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.960]   you know what the probabilities are.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.640]   Like you can look those up.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.660]   In the markets, you don't know.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.540]   So let's bring in the person
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.880]   who actually was the first one to teach me
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.040]   about the benefits of thinking in terms of probabilities,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.180]   Mr. Barry Ritholtz.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.980]   - Hey, Barry.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.800]   - Hey, everybody.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.640]   How you doing?
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.480]   - Good.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.400]   - Barry, you've always said that like the,
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.860]   you think of the future in terms of a range of outcomes
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.700]   or probabilities.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.700]   Never, it's not an always or never thing.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.400]   It's never 100% this or 0% that,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.280]   but you also can't say 40% every time
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.360]   like some of these economists do
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.420]   because then that's like an intellectual hedge
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.440]   of I just never want to be wrong.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.480]   And I think the current setup is a good case in point.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.680]   I've heard you give talks on this before.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.920]   Like people wanna know like what's the hard landing,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.680]   soft landing, no landing,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.240]   but how do you think about this in terms of,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.360]   especially for something as complex as the economy,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.020]   placing probabilities on outcomes in an unknowable future?
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.860]   - Right.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.360]   So first, the 40% forecast is hilarious.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.420]   Justin Layhart and Ralph Winkler did a piece
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.960]   in the Wall Street Journal, I think it was 2018,
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.560]   about, hey, always forecast 40%.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.900]   'Cause if it doesn't happen, I was under half,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.280]   so I was right.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   And if it does happen, hey, I warn you,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.520]   this was almost a 50/50 thing.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.360]   - Right.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.180]   - I told you this was a--
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.020]   - You can't be wrong.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.000]   - Right, so that's the joke.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.640]   So first, really the first question you have
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.880]   to ask yourself is why do you wanna forecast
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.280]   anything other than long-term asset class returns?
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.960]   Hey, here's what equities give us,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.280]   and here's what bonds give us,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.180]   and this is what gold gives us.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.620]   And if you have a long enough holding period,
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.060]   and you mentioned Jeremy Schwartz before,
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.280]   20 years is considered long-term,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.720]   well, you could reasonably expect those sort of returns.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.400]   But when we look at economists,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.640]   some of them just extrapolate the current trends,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.480]   others keep in mind--
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.400]   - That's a lot of it, is recency bias,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.780]   is like what just happened is gonna keep going, yeah.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.280]   - Right, employment is falling, it'll keep falling.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   The other thing that I kinda feel lots of people forget
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.460]   is when you're an economist working
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.500]   in a big Wall Street firm,
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.240]   think about the institutional pressures on you
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.880]   to try and stay somewhere in the middle of the pack,
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.940]   don't stand out like the gazelle
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.100]   on the outskirts of the herd
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.460]   when the lions are out hunting,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.300]   don't say anything too radical,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.940]   even if you think the world is going to hell,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.080]   or the world is great,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.260]   there's a lot of pressure on those sorts of jobs,
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.740]   career risk, to go too far away from the herd.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.580]   And then lastly, let's be blunt,
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.720]   forecasting is marketing, plain and simple.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.880]   This is the silly time of year
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.420]   where everybody puts out their year-end forecast,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.980]   the media covers it,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.020]   and we talk about different people's forecasts.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.180]   I wanna ask the person who asked this question,
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.340]   why do you even wanna think about
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.500]   why people are making forecasts?
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.860]   If you're an investor,
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.640]   you should be thinking out decades, or certainly years.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.500]   The problem with 12 months is that it's way too short
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.260]   for any forecast to be consistently accurate
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.460]   'cause the world is just too random.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.740]   - And your point about forecasting the markets
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.140]   versus forecasting the economy is great
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.260]   because even if you had the headlines
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.900]   and knew what the data was gonna be in the economy,
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.300]   it might not help you figure out
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.620]   what the markets are going to do.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.500]   - So if I would have told you,
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.780]   hey, God came down and told me
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.180]   that the Russians were gonna invade Ukraine next year,
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.000]   you probably wouldn't have bet
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.860]   and oil prices will be negative 12 months later.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.260]   Like that's the last thing people are gonna think about.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.740]   - Right, or by the way, a global pandemic
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.420]   is gonna shut the whole economy next quarter.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.860]   Do you think the market's gonna finish up for that year?
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.860]   It's so hard to do second and third steps removed.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.020]   It's as Howard Marks loves to say,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.060]   it's not the first level thinking, it's the second level.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.860]   And then the repercussions in the third level,
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.980]   it just becomes so difficult to try and figure out
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.860]   how all the little waves in the pond
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.620]   when you throw a stone in,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.820]   where it's gonna end up
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820]   by the time it reaches the other side of the lake.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.520]   - The one time that the economic model did say
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.020]   there's 100% chance of recession in 2023, it was wrong.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.540]   And everyone assumed there would be a recession this year
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.380]   and there wasn't.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.700]   So yeah, that's so true is that people forecasting
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   and especially over a short period of time
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.100]   is not even like the data, it's the reaction to the data.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.460]   And that's the thing that you can't,
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.860]   because trying to, you know,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.620]   I can't guess what I'm gonna do tomorrow in some cases,
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.540]   trying to guess what all these collective investors
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.740]   are going to do in a month or a few months, it's impossible.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.020]   - That's why all this sentiment polling is so silly,
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.540]   whether it's markets or inflation or elections.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.940]   When you ask somebody who you're gonna vote for,
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.580]   A, 12 months out,
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.200]   we have no idea who's even gonna be around.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.260]   Good chance that either of the presidential candidates
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.920]   aren't on the ticket, not a coin flip,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.500]   but a pretty significant possibility
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.600]   that one or the other won't be.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.100]   And then it's, are you gonna vote for who you're gonna say?
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.060]   Say you are, are you even gonna get out of the house
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.900]   and vote?
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.700]   We have such low levels of voter participation.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.420]   Those sorts of things are always terrible.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   And it's the same as true when we talk to people
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.700]   about inflation or markets.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.100]   Nobody really knows what next year looks like.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.840]   Nobody knows the random events that are gonna come up.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.640]   So why even try and forecast that?
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.380]   Just look at the long-term returns for various asset classes
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.100]   and that's how you should be thinking about your portfolio.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.380]   - Yeah, I think we can say like,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.060]   the longer your holding period,
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.340]   the better your results should be,
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.540]   but we still can't guarantee with 100% accuracy
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.020]   that like, this is what they're going to be,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.300]   that the future is gonna match the past
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.260]   'cause we just don't know.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.380]   - Right, we can say 99% of all 20-year rolling averages
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.380]   in equities have been positive.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.660]   That's about as much, as close to a guarantee
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.500]   as you're gonna get.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.540]   And by the way, that's just US equities.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.180]   Different countries don't have that same advantage.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.080]   - Right.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.760]   - Is there anyone that like, ranks economist calls
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.560]   and sees like, who has the best, you know,
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.580]   rating for getting things closest over time?
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.280]   - Institutional investor does these annual awards.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.240]   Ed Hyman of ISI for like, 40 years in a row
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.220]   was always top ranked,
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.600]   but it was never because he was making forecasts.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.120]   It was always because,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.040]   hey, these are the three possibilities.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.240]   This is what everybody is expecting.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.160]   This is the surprise that might happen.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.240]   And here's how we think markets will react
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.600]   in each of these cases.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.160]   He actually would be probabilistic
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.440]   and do that second level thinking.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.080]   And his institutional clients have always loved him.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.600]   - I think that is the way if you're thinking of the economy
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.440]   is like, here's maybe my baseline,
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.660]   but here's also some other paths.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.840]   And then you have the outside stuff that happens
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   that you just can't forecast.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.480]   My favorite is the strategists
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   who do the year-end S&P targets.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.040]   And then they let them change them
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   three months before the end of the year.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   And they just put it close to whatever's happened.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.320]   - Right.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.360]   Hey, we were forecasting a 30% crash,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.040]   but the market's up 20%.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.820]   So let's change our target.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.920]   Thanks for nothing.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.360]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   All right.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.000]   - I like the idea of a choose your own adventure style,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.840]   though, where you have a couple of different--
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.040]   - That's basically what it is.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.360]   - And it's a smart way to think about an unknowable future.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.160]   Ed Hyman's probably the guy best known
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.480]   for popularizing that.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.000]   - All right, cool.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.840]   - All right, next question.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.560]   - Up next, we have a question from Michael.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.840]   Huge fan of your podcasts and writing.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.760]   My girlfriend recently received an inheritance
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.680]   and is thinking about how to invest it.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.800]   We're planning to keep a good chunk in cash
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.920]   for a house purchase, but want to invest some as well.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.900]   She was given a few equity positions
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.560]   from her parents' financial advisor,
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.960]   Apple and Microsoft, et cetera,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.100]   that she was told were expected to outperform
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.760]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.200]   I see they really went out there with their calls.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.240]   While that's possible, I think this money
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.080]   should be invested in market ETFs
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.760]   for diversification purposes.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.160]   Do you have any advice on how I should convince her
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.720]   that diversification could be the best option here?
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.520]   It's a tricky situation since this is technically her money,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.320]   but if we get married like we both expect to
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.080]   in the coming years, this decision will impact us both.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.960]   - I mean, obviously, someone in our position
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.760]   that studied this stuff, we can spout
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.800]   on the merits of diversification.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.920]   If you're a young person hearing this for the first time,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.240]   your eyes are gonna glaze over.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.320]   There's no way that anyone wants to hear that.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   So I guess you could try to give the textbook stuff,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.120]   but it's almost like some people just need
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.500]   to live through the experience
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.760]   of holding some individual stocks
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.480]   to know why diversification is important in the first place.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.280]   I don't know if you're gonna be able to convince her
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.840]   unless she really listens to what you have to say.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   - By the way, this was literally Thanksgiving conversation
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.440]   from a cousin of a niece who we hadn't seen
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   in a couple of years since the pandemic,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.920]   single, living on her own, saving for an apartment,
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.080]   saving to buy a house, and ended up getting a bunch
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.360]   of individual stocks and said, "What do I do with these?"
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.000]   And it's like, well, do you wanna live
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.460]   with the ups and downs?
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.280]   You're young, you got a 40-year investment horizon.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.240]   You wanna live with the ups and downs of the volatility,
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.920]   or do you wanna just put it on set and forget
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.960]   and not stress about it?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.200]   I love the framework of regret minimization.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.480]   What's gonna be worse if you stay with these stocks
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.600]   and one of 'em crashes, or if you sell these stocks
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.480]   for an index and they, you know, magnificent seven on you?
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.640]   And the answer this person gave me is,
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.740]   "I don't wanna think about it.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.200]   "I got enough stuff going on in my life.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.520]   "I can't be stressed about this."
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.080]   And I had to say, well, you know the answer then.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.040]   Roll it into VTI, roll it into Vanguard Total Market
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   or the S&P 500, or whatever your index of choice is,
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.020]   and just forget about it.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.200]   Even if it's Microsoft and Apple,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   and you say, "I wanna have a more tech-focused investment."
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.040]   All right, well, roll it into the Qs
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.720]   so you don't have a single stock focus.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.520]   Any given stock could get whacked 50%.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.760]   - Well, I always say the Black Monday crash happened
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   one time in the United States for the market.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.960]   For an individual stock, that can happen
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.360]   any time they put out earnings.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.520]   - Tuesday, right, every Tuesday you get that.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.560]   The market could be up and your stock could be down 20%.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.440]   So, yes, that's a way to think about
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.040]   the volatility of an individual stock.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.360]   Maybe that's, I do like the regret minimization framework.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   That is always a good one.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.520]   And just helping them understand the difference
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.560]   between an individual stock and a basket of stocks.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.520]   A basket of stocks can still go down,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.640]   but it might not get crushed as much,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.600]   especially in a short period of time,
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.040]   as the range of outcomes is just way wider
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.360]   for individual stocks.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.560]   - You know, this question really forces people
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.320]   to think about who they are, what their risk tolerance is,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.040]   how, you have to kind of project yourself forward
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.200]   in time, a decade, and think back
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.960]   about what really is gonna bother me
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.640]   about decisions I made.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.320]   I've spoken to younger people
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.560]   who have investment portfolios and they're like,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.200]   I don't care about my, if the stock goes up and down,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.520]   I'm in my 20s, let it bounce around
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   and Microsoft and Apple are great companies,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.760]   they're not going anywhere.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   If that's your attitude, by all means,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.400]   hold on to a couple of positions
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.440]   around your core portfolio and let 'em run.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.240]   But just be aware of the fact that sometimes,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.280]   look at how many times Amazon,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.200]   one of the biggest companies in the world,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.400]   in the early 2000s, Amazon crashed 80 something percent
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.120]   to three or four dollars.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.680]   And then again, we saw the crash post.com
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.520]   and then in 2020, and then they took off.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   And you really have to understand,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.160]   I'm in this company for the long run
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.240]   and I'm hoping it's not Lehman or Enron.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.280]   - He also said here that they're dating now
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.080]   and hoping to get married in the future.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   I actually think this is a good time
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   to have this kind of money talk
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.200]   to understand how you both approach it.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.000]   So before you even get married,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.560]   I think you can, it's a good time
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.000]   to have this kind of talk to understand
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   how you feel about this kind of stuff.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.360]   - You know, indexers and active stock pickers can be married.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.040]   It's just a core and satellite sort of portfolio.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.320]   They don't have to butt heads.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.000]   It could be complimentary.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.440]   - He's such a romantic.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.680]   - The data shows she's gonna outperform him.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.200]   Women are better investors than men
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   because they're more logical.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   They're more rational.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.120]   They don't make these crazy moves.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.600]   - Less overconfidence, less arrogance.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.320]   The data, by the way, is overwhelming on this.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.000]   And it's not like a teeny little bit.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.560]   It's a substantial amount of bips.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.520]   You'll see 50 or 100 basis points of outperformance
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.160]   by women over male fund managers.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.480]   - On that note, speaking from experience,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.400]   you'd be surprised or maybe not surprised
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   how demoralizing it is to open up your brokerage account
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.320]   and just see a straight line down
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.000]   on one of your biggest holdings.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.480]   And especially if it happens multiple times in a year,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.640]   it can get exhausting, you know?
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.680]   - The time to have those experiences, as Ben says,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.640]   is when you're young and you could recover it.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.920]   That's the crazy thing about the best time
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.520]   to have terrible things happen to your portfolio
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.680]   is when it really doesn't matter
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.080]   because your portfolio is so small.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.880]   And as you get older and you hold bigger portfolios
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.600]   and more and more of your wealth is in the stock market,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.760]   you kind of look at market crashes when it does matter.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.480]   And you say, yeah, I'm in a broad index.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.560]   It'll come back.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.400]   It's so weird that the less it matters,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.040]   the worse it is for you.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.320]   And the more it matters, you've by that time
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.600]   had a little experience and wisdom
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.760]   and you're just willing to ride it out.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.320]   - All right, we got one more question.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.200]   This is actually one we haven't really gotten before.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.240]   And I wanted you particularly for this one, Barry.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.720]   So I'm interested in your thoughts on this.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.760]   - Okay, so this question's from Adam.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360]   Do you have any rules of thumb for clients
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.040]   regarding rare jewelry, collectibles, or art?
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.560]   I want to buy a watch and I'm having trouble moving forward.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.840]   If you looked at my financials,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.800]   you'd have no problem approving the purchase.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   I didn't grow up well off, so it's foreign to me
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.240]   to make a big ticket purchase like this.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.560]   One thought I had was that a limited collection of art
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.680]   or watches can appreciate in value.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.840]   I've studied watches for over a decade and know them well.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.400]   But I'm now thinking that if I was fine buying iBonds
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   when the rates were super high,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   why wouldn't I do the same for an investment watch?
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.480]   Am I just rationalizing this
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.400]   or is there some merit to this thinking?
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   We have the right guy.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.160]   Barry is a watch expert.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.440]   - Yeah, I'm really not a big collectibles guy.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   But Barry, you've dabbled in some of this stuff
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.720]   and you like cars and stuff.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.520]   How do you, do you ever approach this stuff differently
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.440]   because it is more of a hobby than anything?
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   Or do you try to have a finance brain
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.880]   when going into collectibles and think like,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.840]   well, I think I'm gonna buy this because I like it,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.560]   but also because it's gonna appreciate in value potentially?
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.120]   - So I love this question for so many reasons.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.520]   And you know, as I do, when we're dealing with clients
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.760]   who are successful and have money in the bank
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.960]   and all their boxes are checked
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.360]   and all their bills are paid,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.880]   we kind of have to push them into spending money on things
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.800]   like vacations and family travel.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.720]   - Right, if you wanna do this then,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.600]   and you can afford to do it.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   - So that's number one.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.880]   Number two, and you've heard me say this so many times,
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.280]   whenever I see the list of,
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.100]   look how much this art has appreciated
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.120]   or this particular Ferrari was just sold for $51 million
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.080]   or this watch, that is classic survivorship bias.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.760]   'Cause you're telling me what's done really well.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.520]   You're not telling me about all the other stuff
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.240]   people bought 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.560]   Hey, I'm buying this Ford Escort
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.400]   'cause I think it's gonna go up in value.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.600]   Or this, I give you a list of beautiful watches
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.080]   from some of the finest watch companies in the world
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.540]   that haven't appreciated the value.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.380]   - Yeah, the bad ones don't get reported probably, right?
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.700]   - You don't hear about that.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.140]   So what I always tell people
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.020]   who are looking at an expensive watch,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.380]   first, if it's not one of the big three trilogy,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.180]   which is essentially AP, Patek Philippe, and Rolex,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.940]   the first thing you should do is,
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.380]   well, first, if you want a watch, go buy a watch.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.380]   Second, if you're looking at an expensive watch,
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.820]   don't be afraid to buy a used watch.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.140]   You could go to places like Chrono24 or Hodinkee.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.020]   And there was a watch I was in love with for years
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.360]   and never wanted to pull the trigger on,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.200]   found it about half price used.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.860]   - Wait, are you saying that my Fossil
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.140]   is not in the big three?
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.740]   - Your Fossil is not in the big three,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.340]   but it's owned by a company that has a lot of great brands.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.060]   In fact, there's about half a dozen
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.220]   big Swiss watch companies that own,
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.960]   you know, there's hundreds of brands.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.300]   So I happen to like, a Lange & Söhne is a watch I like.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.140]   I'm wearing a Rolex, my first Rolex,
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.920]   I got right as I was finishing up Bailout Nation.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.600]   I bought it from a mortgage broker
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.540]   who is liquidating everything.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.380]   - Oh, really?
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.200]   Oh, so you bought low.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.040]   - Too soon.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.180]   No, I bought, and I still have that watch.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.660]   I never sell these.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.180]   I hardly sell cars.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.260]   If you want to buy something that's collectible,
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.960]   go buy what you love and enjoy it.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.940]   And if it turns out to appreciate, great.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.500]   But, you know, if you,
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.100]   I love there's a couple of websites that do watch charts.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.180]   Bloomberg also has a watch index.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.340]   And not surprisingly, a lot of people had a lot of money
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.120]   in their bank accounts during the pandemic.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.780]   Watches ran up, and a lot of these watches,
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.680]   yeah, and a lot of these are now down 20, 30%
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.520]   from their highs.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.020]   So it was a speculative bubble.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.180]   Don't think about things like,
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.100]   unless that's your full-time job, right?
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.260]   Unless you really want to spend a lot of time
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.820]   thinking about the investment aspects of cars and watches.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.580]   By the way, watches require safes.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.340]   They require bank vaults.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.500]   Cars require maintenance and insurance
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.860]   and mechanical upgrades.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.060]   It's a lot more complicated than, you know,
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.660]   it's not just a matter of paying $3,000 for a Ferrari
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.100]   in 1965 and selling it for $50 million 50 years later.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.260]   That's the exception.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.580]   Most of the time, you're driving the car,
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.500]   you're putting insurance on it, you're doing maintenance.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.820]   They're breaking down on the side of the road.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.940]   It's, as opposed to cost you nothing to buy an index fund
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.140]   and you put it away and forget about it,
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.900]   a much easier experience.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.580]   - It sounds like he's also asking for permission, too,
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.460]   'cause he said, "I grew up not very well off.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.780]   "Now I have some money."
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.420]   I'm sure he's looking at the price tag and going,
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.000]   "Am I really gonna spend that on something
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.840]   "that goes on my wrist?"
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.140]   - Yeah, does a Rolex keep time better than, you know,
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.500]   a watch half the price? - No.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.820]   Your phone keeps time better than anything.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.180]   In fact-- - That was the great
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.500]   Paul Rudd quote in Sarah Marshall.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.220]   He said, "I got rid of my watch and I moved out here."
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.040]   And they said, "Oh, really?
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.880]   "You don't?"
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.020]   "No, it's because I have it on my phone."
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.800]   But yes, I think it's-- - But it's really true.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.840]   - Yeah, but if you're looking for the permission to do it,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.700]   and again, your finances are fine,
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.340]   and you spend on a big ticket item,
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.700]   like, enjoy yourself a little.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.260]   What's the point of saving in the first place
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.780]   if you're really well off if you're not gonna enjoy it?
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.820]   - The only caveat is all of these things,
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.420]   whether it's art or automobiles or watches
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.260]   or pick your poison, they're a rabbit hole.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.100]   And, you know, it's the joke about tattoos.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.260]   Two tattoos is either too many or too few.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.460]   You start to have the same thing happening
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.940]   with watches and cars or whatever.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.140]   Artwork, if you wanna tumble down that rabbit hole,
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.860]   you can, but, you know, I go to different car events
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.220]   and different watch events,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   and it's a casual, fun interest for me.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.140]   I see people who are just hardcore.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.180]   They really-- - But it's more of a hobby
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.540]   than it is an investment.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.880]   - 100%, think about it as a hobby.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.900]   You'll never be disappointed, and you know what?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.340]   If you leave it to your kids or your nephew
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.700]   and it's appreciated, fantastic.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.500]   - Right, hey, that was dad's watch.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.620]   - I'm not buying Picassos, obviously,
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.820]   but I have friends that are artists
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.740]   and photographers and things,
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.420]   and I've got some of their work.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.620]   And that's cool because it's like,
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.380]   at least you're also enjoying it, you know?
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.020]   And if it becomes valuable one day,
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.860]   then maybe you would consider selling something.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.820]   But otherwise, you're enjoying it in the meantime.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.940]   It's probably the most speculative
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.380]   out of all those, right?
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.460]   - Right, but if you're gonna put it on your wall,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.000]   don't assume that pretty painting is your retirement plan.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.040]   - Right, exactly, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.400]   Also, on the note of cars,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.880]   I just, I have to bring up the Cybertruck
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.460]   because I saw you wrote a post literally called clown car.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.160]   - So that's not my quote.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.680]   I'm quoting somebody who called it a clown car.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.460]   To me, it looks like the,
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.240]   I don't know if you remember the game "Battlezone"
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.080]   or "Tank Command" that you used to be able to play
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.680]   those vector-shaped tanks.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.620]   That's what it looks like to me.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.020]   - He took a swing, he took a swing with it.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.020]   - It's funny to see Tesla in a space
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.660]   where they're behind the rest of the industry
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.400]   'cause they've been so far ahead.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.620]   Their software, the over-the-air updates,
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.580]   they've been so far ahead of everybody for so long.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.400]   The Ford 150 Lightning is a fantastic truck.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.940]   I had one last summer for a week.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.180]   - Is it bulletproof?
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.740]   - I don't know if people, you know,
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.340]   I'm not expecting the zombie apocalypse.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.300]   So a bulletproof car to me isn't worth to exchange
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.660]   the added weight, the reduced acceleration,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.520]   the shorter range.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.900]   I don't really think I need those sort of bowling proof,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.740]   bowling ball proof glass,
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.680]   which is what he used on the first demo.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.980]   That said, maybe Elon is not the greatest guy
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.580]   in terms of figuring out humans and social networks,
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.700]   but he's pretty good when it comes to companies
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.660]   based on physics.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.940]   - Someone in the chat says it's the DeLorean of the 2020s,
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.780]   which is--
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.180]   - Wouldn't surprise me.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.540]   You know, they're late.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.020]   That hardened steel is very hard to work with.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.180]   You can't just stamp it.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.180]   - As someone who has three kids and a lot of gear,
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.940]   I just like an SUV, an electric SUV.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.400]   That's all I ask for.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.860]   - Well, you should look at the R1S.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.700]   - That's what I was gonna say.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.500]   The Rivian, Doug DeMuro did a video on the R1T pickup,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.660]   called it the greatest truck ever made.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.660]   Wild acceleration, incredible off-road capabilities,
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.740]   passing Range Rovers, passing Jeeps up a hill,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.460]   just the power and the independence of how--
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   - The soccer moms are not using these to go off-road, but--
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.740]   - The Hyundais are nice also, and they're half the price.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.580]   So that's not a bad way to look at it.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.340]   - I think some of it is gonna come down to capability,
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.180]   though, right?
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.860]   If the Cybertruck can tow more than any other truck
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.500]   in the same price category,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.100]   then maybe people will buy it just for that.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.020]   - Well, what are you towing?
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.300]   If I tow a boat, I need it to move 8,000 pounds.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.900]   To me, I'm not using it.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.740]   Now, that said--
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.940]   - What if you're towing two boats?
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.420]   - Or two jet skis, but that said,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.820]   Ford really promotes the F-150 Lightning
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.860]   as a vehicle for contractors,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   that it could carry, that it could tow,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:22.060]   and you could plug in all of your electric appliances
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.540]   and tools. - It's pretty neat.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.780]   - Like, it becomes the center of a job site,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.980]   and they very much design that
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.820]   towards those sort of contractors.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.220]   We'll see, you know, we're recording this
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   before the official unveiling is.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.540]   - I think it's starting now, right?
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.780]   - About 45 minutes from now.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.900]   We'll get the prices, the details, all the things.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.260]   Either they will have nailed it,
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.260]   and they have almost two million reservations.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.900]   - I'll wait 'til they start marking all these down
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.820]   when people stop buying 'em.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.700]   - We'll see what happens.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.460]   I mean, it's all gonna be based on price and specs,
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.700]   and we'll find out soon enough.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.900]   - I think it's gonna be really popular
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.980]   with people who loved playing Halo back in the day.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.820]   It kinda looks like
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.660]   one of those vehicles. - It looks like that, right?
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.500]   - Yeah. - It does.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.940]   - Vector-based auto design.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.140]   - Okay, thanks to everyone who showed up live.
