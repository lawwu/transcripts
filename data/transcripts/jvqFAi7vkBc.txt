[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   I think compute is going to be the currency of the future. I think it will be maybe the
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:14.260]   most precious commodity in the world. I expect that by the end of this decade, and possibly
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.760]   somewhat sooner than that, we will have quite capable systems that we look at and say, "Wow,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.160]   that's really remarkable." The road to AGI should be a giant power struggle. I expect
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   that to be the case.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.660]   Whoever builds AGI first gets a lot of power. Do you trust yourself with that much power?
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.280]   The following is a conversation with Sam Altman, his second time in the podcast. He is the
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.760]   CEO of OpenAI, the company behind GPT-4, Chad GPT, Sora, and perhaps one day, the very
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.880]   company that will build AGI. This is Alex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.680]   out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Altman.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.240]   Take me through the OpenAI board saga that started on Thursday, November 16th, maybe
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.720]   Friday, November 17th for you.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:24.440]   That was definitely the most painful professional experience of my life. Chaotic and shameful
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.760]   and upsetting and a bunch of other negative things. There were great things about it too,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.360]   and I wish it had not been in such an adrenaline rush that I wasn't able to stop and appreciate
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.040]   them at the time. But I came across this old tweet of mine, or this tweet of mine from
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880]   that time period, which was like, it was like, you know, kind of going to your own eulogy,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.280]   watching people say all these great things about you and just like unbelievable support
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.560]   from people I love and care about. That was really nice.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.640]   That whole weekend, with one big exception, I felt like a great deal of love and very
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.720]   little hate, even though it felt like I have no idea what's happening and what's going
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.840]   to happen here, and this feels really bad. There were definitely times I thought it was
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.400]   going to be one of the worst things to ever happen for AI safety. Well, I also think I'm
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.760]   happy that it happened relatively early. I thought at some point between when OpenAI
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.080]   started and when we created AGI, there was going to be something crazy and explosive
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.240]   that happened, but there may be more crazy and explosive things still to happen. It still,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:02.280]   I think, helped us build up some resilience and be ready for more challenges in the future.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.720]   But the thing you had a sense that you would experience is some kind of power struggle.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.920]   The road to AGI should be a giant power struggle. The world should. Well, not should, I expect
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.240]   that to be the case. And so, you have to go through that, like you said, iterate as often
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.000]   as possible in figuring out how to have a board structure, how to have organization,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.760]   how to have the kind of people that you're working with, how to communicate all that
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.640]   in order to deescalate the power struggle as much as possible, pacify it. But at this
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:49.720]   point it feels like something that was in the past that was really unpleasant and really
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.120]   difficult and painful, but we're back to work and things are so busy and so intense that
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.680]   I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.880]   There was a time after, there was this fugue state for the month after, maybe 45 days after,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.920]   that I was just sort of drifting through the days. I was so out of it. I was feeling so
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   down.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.240]   Just at a personal psychological level.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:28.160]   Yeah. Really painful. And hard to have to keep running open AI in the middle of that.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   I just wanted to crawl into a cave and kind of recover for a while. But now it's like
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   we're just back to working on the mission.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:48.860]   Well, it's still useful to go back there and reflect on board structures, on power dynamics,
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.480]   on how companies are run, the tension between research and product development and money
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.800]   and all this kind of stuff, so that you, who have a very high potential of building AGI,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.200]   would do so in a slightly more organized, less dramatic way in the future. So there's
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.360]   value there to go, both the personal psychological aspects of you as a leader and also just the
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.480]   board structure and all this kind of messy stuff.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:30.320]   We learned a lot about structure and incentives and what we need out of a board. I think it
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.560]   is valuable that this happened now in some sense. I think this is probably not the last
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.760]   high-stress moment of open AI, but it was quite a high-stress moment. My company very
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.100]   nearly got destroyed. We think a lot about many of the other things we've got to get
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.720]   right for AGI, but thinking about how to build a resilient org and how to build a structure
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.920]   that will stand up to a lot of pressure in the world, which I expect more and more as
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.120]   we get closer, I think that's super important.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   Do you have a sense of how deep and rigorous the deliberation process by the board was?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.320]   Can you shine some light on just human dynamics involved in situations like this? Was it just
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   a few conversations and all of a sudden it escalates and why don't we fire Sam kind of
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   thing?
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:37.520]   I think the board members are well-meaning people on the whole. I believe that in stressful
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:49.080]   situations where people feel time pressure or whatever, people understandably make sub-optimal
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.320]   decisions. I think one of the challenges for open AI will be we're going to have to have
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.920]   a board and a team that are good at operating under pressure.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.960]   Do you think the board had too much power?
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   I think boards are supposed to have a lot of power, but one of the things that we did
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.160]   see is in most corporate structures, boards are usually answerable to shareholders. Sometimes
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.040]   people have super voting shares or whatever. In this case, and I think one of the things
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.000]   with our structure that we maybe should have thought about more than we did, is that the
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   board of a nonprofit has, unless you put other rules in place, quite a lot of power. They
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.440]   don't really answer to anyone but themselves. There's ways in which that's good, but what
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   we'd really like is for the board of open AI to answer to the world as a whole as much
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   as that's a practical thing.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.680]   So, there's a new board announced?
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.840]   There's, I guess, a new smaller board at first and now there's a new final board.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.600]   Not a final board yet. We've added some, a lot more.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:05.960]   Okay. What is fixed in the new one that was perhaps broken in the previous one?
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.080]   The old board sort of got smaller over the course of about a year. It was nine and then
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:20.040]   it went down to six. Then we couldn't agree on who to add. The board also, I think, didn't
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.280]   have a lot of experienced board members. A lot of the new board members at open AI have
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.480]   just have more experience as board members. I think that'll help.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's been criticized, some of the people that are added to the board. I heard a lot of people
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   criticizing the addition of Larry Summers, for example. What's the process of selecting
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.160]   the board like? What's involved in that?
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   So, Brett and Larry were kind of decided in the heat of the moment over this very tense
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.760]   weekend. That weekend was like a real roller coaster. It was like a lot of ups and downs.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:05.360]   We were trying to agree on new board members that both sort of the executive team here
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.680]   and the old board members felt would be reasonable. Larry was actually one of their suggestions,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.640]   the old board members. Brett, I think, I had even previous to that weekend suggested, but
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.600]   he was busy and didn't want to do it. Then we really needed help in wood. We talked about
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:32.440]   a lot of other people too, but I felt like if I was going to come back, I needed new
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.640]   board members. I didn't think I could work with the old board again in the same configuration.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:48.120]   We then decided, and I'm grateful that Adam would stay, but we considered various configurations
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.000]   and decided we wanted to get to a board of three and had to find two new board members
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.240]   over the course of sort of a short period of time. Those were decided honestly without
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.640]   – that's like you kind of do that on the battlefield. You don't have time to design
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:11.260]   a rigorous process then. For new board members since, new board members will add going forward,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.640]   we have some criteria that we think are important for the board to have, different expertise
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.560]   that we want the board to have. Unlike hiring an executive where you need them to do one
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:30.880]   role well, the board needs to do a whole role of kind of governance and thoughtfulness well.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.160]   One thing that Brett says, which I really like, is that we want to hire board members
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.080]   in slates, not as individuals one at a time. Thinking about a group of people that will
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.240]   bring nonprofit expertise, expertise in running companies, sort of good legal and governance
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.920]   expertise, that's kind of what we've tried to optimize for.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.200]   So it's technical savvy important for the individual board members?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.520]   Not for every board member, but for certainly some you need that. That's part of what
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.520]   the board needs to do.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.680]   So, I mean, the interesting thing that people probably don't understand about OpenAI, I
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.640]   certainly don't, is like all the details of running the business. When they think about
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.200]   the board, given the drama, they think about you, they think about like, if you reach AGI
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   or you reach some of these incredibly impactful products and you build them and deploy them,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.000]   what's the conversation with the board like? And they kind of think, all right, what's
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.080]   the right squad to have in that kind of situation to deliberate?
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.840]   Look, I think you definitely need some technical experts there. And then you need some people
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.420]   who are like, how can we deploy this in a way that will help people in the world the
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.840]   most and people who have a very different perspective? I think a mistake that you or
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.320]   I might make is to think that only the technical understanding matters. And that's definitely
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.960]   part of the conversation you want that board to have, but there's a lot more about how
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.240]   that's going to just like impact society and people's lives that you really want represented
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   in there too.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.760]   And you're just kind of, are you looking at the track record of people or you're just
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.000]   having conversations?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.760]   Track record is a big deal. You of course have a lot of conversations, but I, you know,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:16.600]   there's some roles where I kind of totally ignore track record and just look at slope,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   kind of ignore the Y-intercept.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.560]   Thank you. Thank you for making it mathematical for the audience.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.440]   For a board member, like I do care much more about the Y-intercept. Like I think there
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.280]   is something deep to say about track record there. And experience is sometimes very hard
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   to replace.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.720]   Do you try to fit a polynomial function or exponential one to the, to the track record?
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.280]   That's not that, an analogy doesn't carry that far.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   All right. You mentioned some of the low points that weekend. What were some of the low points
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.420]   psychologically for you? Did you consider going to the Amazon jungle and just taking
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.840]   an ayahuasca and disappearing forever or?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.920]   I mean, there's so many low, like it was a very bad period of time. There were great
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:05.960]   high points too. Like my phone was just like sort of nonstop blowing up with nice messages
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.720]   from people I work with every day, people I hadn't talked to in a decade. I didn't get
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.680]   to like appreciate that as much as I should have because I was just like in the middle
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.240]   of this firefight, but that was really nice. But on the whole, it was like a very painful
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:25.840]   weekend and also just like a very, it was like a battle fought in public to a surprising
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.320]   degree. And that's, that was extremely exhausting to me much more than I expected. I think fights
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:39.100]   are generally exhausting, but this one really was, you know, the board did this Friday afternoon.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.320]   I really couldn't get much in the way of answers, but I also was just like, well, the board
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.240]   gets to do this. And so I'm going to think for a little bit about what I want to do,
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:56.560]   but I'll try to find the blessing in disguise here. And I was like, well, I, you know, my
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.960]   current job at OpenAI is or it was like to like run a decently sized company at this
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.760]   point. And the thing I had always liked the most was just getting to like work on, work
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.000]   with the researchers. And I was like, yeah, I can just go do like a very focused AGI research
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.760]   effort. And I got excited about that. It didn't even occur to me at the time to like, possibly
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.560]   that this was all going to get undone. This was like Friday afternoon.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.280]   So you've accepted your, the death of this previous-
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.360]   Very quickly, very quickly. Like within, you know, I mean, I went through like a little
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   period of confusion and rage, but very quickly. And by Friday night, I was like talking to
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:38.920]   people about what was going to be next. And I was excited about that. I think it was Friday
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.840]   night evening for the first time that I heard from the exec team here, which was like, hey,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.600]   we're going to like fight this. And, you know, we think, well, whatever. And then I went
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.160]   to bed just still being like, okay, excited. Like onward, were you able to sleep? Not a
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   lot. It was one of the weird things was, it was this like period of four and a half days
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.640]   where sort of didn't sleep much, didn't eat much and still kind of had like a surprising
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.520]   amount of energy. It was, you learn like a weird thing about adrenaline and more time.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.080]   So you kind of accepted the death of a, you know, this baby opening eyes.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.760]   And I was excited for the new thing. I was just like, okay, this was crazy, but whatever.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.560]   It's a very good coping mechanism.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.600]   And then Saturday morning, two of the board members called and said, hey, we, you know,
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   destabilize, we didn't mean to destabilize things. We don't want to destroy a lot of
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.520]   value here. You know, can we talk about you coming back? And I immediately didn't want
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.080]   to do that, but I thought a little more and I was like, well, I don't really care about
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.400]   the people here, the partners, shareholders, like all of the, I love this company.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.080]   And so I thought about it and I was like, well, okay, but like, here's, here's the stuff
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   I would need. And, and then the most painful time of all was over the course of that weekend.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.280]   I kept thinking and being told, and we all kept, not just me, like the whole team here
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.980]   kept thinking, well, we were trying to like keep OpenAI stabilized while the whole world
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.460]   was trying to break it apart, people trying to recruit, whatever.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.880]   We kept being told like, all right, we're almost done. We're almost done. We just need
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   like a little bit more time. And it was this like very confusing state. And then Sunday
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.180]   evening, when again, like every few hours I expected that we were going to be done and
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.880]   we're going to like figure out a way for me to return and things to go back to how they
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:29.520]   were, the board then appointed a new interim CEO. And then I was like, I mean, that is,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.320]   that is, that feels really bad. That was the low point of the whole thing.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.840]   You know, I'll tell you something. I, it felt very painful, but I felt a lot of love that
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.520]   whole weekend. It was not other than that one moment, Sunday night, I would not characterize
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:56.720]   my emotions as anger or hate. But I really just like, I felt a lot of love from people
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.640]   towards people. It was like painful, but it would like the dominant emotion of the weekend
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.240]   was love, not hate.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.600]   You've spoken highly of Mira Moradi that she helped, especially as you put in a tweet in
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   the quiet moments when it counts, perhaps we could take a bit of a tangent. What do
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.800]   you admire about Mira?
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:22.240]   Well, she did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos, but, but people often see
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:29.000]   leaders in the moment in like the crisis moments, good or bad. But a thing I really value in
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.760]   leaders is how people act on a boring Tuesday at 9 46 in the morning. And in, in just sort
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:43.260]   of the, the, the normal drudgery of the day to day, how someone shows up in a meeting,
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.160]   the quality of the decisions they make. That was what I meant about the quiet moments.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:55.840]   Meaning like most of the work is done on a day by day in a meeting by meeting just, just
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.400]   be present and, and make great decisions.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.160]   Yeah. I mean, look what you wanted to have wanted to spend the last 20 minutes about,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.240]   and I understand is like this one very dramatic weekend. Yeah. But that's not really what
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.600]   opening eyes about opening eyes really about the other seven years.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.160]   Well, yeah. Human civilization is not about the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.020]   but still that's something people focus on very, very understandable. It gives us an
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.540]   insight into human nature, the extremes of human nature, and perhaps some of the damage
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.620]   and some of the triumphs of human civilization can happen in those moments. So it's like
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:36.460]   illustrative. Let me ask you about Ilya. Is he being held hostage in a secret nuclear
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.460]   facility?
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.460]   No.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460]   What about a regular secret facility?
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   No.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.460]   A regular nuclear non-secret facility.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.460]   Neither of them. Not that either.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.460]   I mean, it's becoming a meme at some point. You've known Ilya for a long time. He was
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:54.860]   obviously in part of this drama with the board and all that kind of stuff. What's your relationship
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.060]   with him now?
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.720]   I love Ilya. I have tremendous respect for Ilya. I don't have anything I can like say
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.220]   about his plans right now. That's a question for him. But I really hope we work together
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.540]   for certainly the rest of my career. He's a little bit younger than me. Maybe he works
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.540]   a little bit longer.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:25.220]   There's a meme that he saw something. He maybe saw AGI and that gave him a lot of worry internally.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.860]   What did Ilya see?
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:37.740]   Ilya has not seen AGI. None of us have seen AGI. We've not built AGI. I do think one of
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:47.340]   the many things that I really love about Ilya is he takes AGI and the safety concerns, broadly
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:55.780]   speaking, including things like the impact this is going to have on society, very seriously.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:01.140]   As we continue to make significant progress, Ilya is one of the people that I spent the
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.940]   most time over the last couple of years talking about what this is going to mean, what we
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:14.620]   need to do to ensure we get it right, to ensure that we succeed at the mission. Ilya did not
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:27.380]   see AGI, but Ilya is a credit to humanity in terms of how much he thinks and worries
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.940]   about making sure we get this right.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.460]   I had a bunch of conversations with him in the past. I think when he talks about technology,
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.460]   he's always doing this long-term thinking type of thing. He's not thinking about what
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.900]   this is going to be in a year. He's thinking about it in 10 years. Just thinking from first
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:51.140]   principles like, "Okay, if this scales, what are the fundamentals here? Where is this going?"
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.980]   That's a foundation for them thinking about all the other safety concerns and all that
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:03.740]   kind of stuff, which makes him a really fascinating human to talk with. Do you have any idea why
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.700]   he's been quiet? Is it he's just doing some soul searching?
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:18.420]   Again, I don't want to speak for Ilya. I think that you should ask him that. He's definitely
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:26.660]   a thoughtful guy. I think Ilya is always on a soul search in a really good way.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:33.980]   Yes. Yeah. Also, he appreciates the power of silence. Also, I'm told he can be a silly guy,
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.180]   which I've never seen that side of him.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.300]   It's very sweet when that happens.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:43.860]   I've never witnessed a silly Ilya, but I look forward to that as well.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.740]   I was at a dinner party with him recently, and he was playing with a puppy. And he was
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.220]   in a very silly mood, very endearing. And I was thinking like, "Oh, man, this is not the
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.300]   side of Ilya that the world sees the most."
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:00.860]   So just to wrap up this whole saga, are you feeling good about the board structure,
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.540]   about all of this, and where it's moving?
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.780]   I feel great about the new board. In terms of the structure of OpenAI, one of the board's
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.980]   tasks is to look at that and see where we can make it more robust. We wanted to get
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.900]   new board members in place first, but we clearly learned a lesson about structure
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.780]   throughout this process. I don't have, I think, super deep things to say. It was a crazy,
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.220]   very painful experience. I think it was like a perfect storm of weirdness. It was like
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.060]   a preview for me of what's going to happen as the stakes get higher and higher, and the
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:40.780]   need that we have robust governance structures and processes and people. I am kind of happy
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:46.620]   it happened when it did, but it was a shockingly painful thing to go through.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.580]   Did it make you be more hesitant in trusting people?
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.020]   Yes.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.380]   Just on a personal level?
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.500]   Yes. I think I'm an extremely trusting person. I've always had a life philosophy of don't
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.260]   worry about all of the paranoia, don't worry about the edge cases. You get a little bit
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:09.380]   screwed in exchange for getting to live with your guard down. This was so shocking to me,
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.500]   I was so caught off guard, that it has definitely changed, and I really don't like this. It's
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.420]   definitely changed how I think about just default trust of people and planning for the
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.180]   bad scenarios.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.580]   You got to be careful with that. Are you worried about becoming a little too cynical?
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.180]   I'm not worried about becoming too cynical. I think I'm the extreme opposite of a cynical
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.380]   person, but I'm worried about just becoming less of a default trusting person.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:43.020]   I'm actually not sure which mode is best to operate in for a person who's developing AGI.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:49.660]   Trusting or untrusting. It's an interesting journey you're on. But in terms of structure,
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.740]   see, I'm more interested on the human level. How do you surround yourself with humans that
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:01.340]   are building cool shit, but also are making wise decisions? Because the more money you
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.540]   start making, the more power the thing has, the weirder people get.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:12.860]   I think you could make all kinds of comments about the board members and the level of trust
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.140]   I should have had there, or how I should have done things differently. But in terms of the
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:25.740]   team here, I think you'd have to give me a very good grade on that one. I have just enormous
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.620]   gratitude and trust and respect for the people that I work with every day. I think being
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:40.020]   surrounded with people like that is really important.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:48.780]   Our mutual friend Elon sued OpenAI. What is the essence of what he's criticizing? To what
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.380]   degree does he have a point? To what degree is he wrong?
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:57.660]   I don't know what it's really about. We started off just thinking we were going to be a research
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:04.540]   lab and having no idea about how this technology was going to go. Because it was only seven
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.500]   or eight years ago, it's hard to go back and really remember what it was like then. But
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.900]   before language models were a big deal, this was before we had any idea about an API or
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.980]   selling access to a chatbot. This was before we had any idea we were going to productize
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   at all.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.060]   So we're just going to try to do research, and we don't really know what we're going
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.260]   to do with that. I think with many fundamentally new things, you start fumbling through the
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:33.580]   dark and you make some assumptions, most of which turn out to be wrong. Then it became
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:42.460]   clear that we were going to need to do different things and also have huge amounts
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.700]   more capital. So we said, "Okay, well, the structure doesn't quite work for that. How
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.260]   do we patch the structure?" And then patch it again and patch it again, and you end up
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:57.900]   with something that does look kind of eyebrow-raising, to say the least. But we got here gradually
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:03.460]   with, I think, reasonable decisions at each point along the way. And it doesn't mean
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.540]   I wouldn't do it totally differently if we could go back now with an oracle, but you
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.340]   don't get the oracle at the time. But anyway, in terms of what Elon's real motivations
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.100]   here are, I don't know.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:19.140]   LR: To the degree you remember, what was the response that OpenAI gave in the blog post?
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.220]   Can you summarize it?
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:35.420]   CB: Oh, Elon said this set of things. Here's the characterization of how this went down.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:43.620]   We tried to not make it emotional and just say, "Here's the history."
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:54.540]   LR: I do think there's a degree of mischaracterization from Elon here about one of the points you
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:00.780]   just made, which is the degree of uncertainty you had at the time. You guys are a bunch
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:07.420]   of like a small group of researchers crazily talking about AGI when everybody's laughing
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   at that thought.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:14.060]   Wasn't that long ago Elon was crazily talking about launching rockets when people were laughing
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:20.260]   at that thought? So I think he'd have more empathy for this.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:28.380]   CB: I mean, I do think that there's personal stuff here, that there was a split, that OpenAI
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.940]   and a lot of amazing people here chose to part ways with Elon. So there's a personal--
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.180]   LR: Elon chose to part ways.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:41.500]   Can you describe that exactly, the choosing to part ways?
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.580]   CB: He thought OpenAI was going to fail. He wanted total control to sort of turn it around.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.940]   We wanted to keep going in the direction that now has become OpenAI. He also wanted Tesla
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:57.580]   to be able to build an AGI effort. At various times he wanted to make OpenAI into a for-profit
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.340]   company that he could have control of or have it merge with Tesla. We didn't want to do
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.540]   that and he decided to leave, which that's fine.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.380]   So you're saying, and that's one of the things that the blog post says, is that he wanted
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:19.620]   OpenAI to be basically acquired by Tesla in the same way that-- Or maybe something similar
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.100]   or maybe something more dramatic than the partnership with Microsoft.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.340]   My memory is the proposal was just like, "Yeah, get acquired by Tesla and have Tesla have
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.620]   full control over it." I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:37.980]   So what is the word open in OpenAI mean? To Elon at the time, Ilya has talked about this
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.900]   in the email exchanges and all this kind of stuff. What does it mean to you at the time?
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.900]   What does it mean to you now?
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.540]   I would definitely pick a different-- Speaking of going back with an Oracle, I'd pick a different
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:53.260]   name. One of the things that I think OpenAI is doing that is the most important of everything
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:29:01.860]   that we're doing is putting powerful technology in the hands of people for free as a public
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:08.380]   good. We don't run ads on our free version. We don't monetize it in other ways. We just
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.780]   say as part of our mission, we want to put increasingly powerful tools in the hands of
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.940]   people for free and get them to use them.
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:23.060]   I think that kind of open is really important to our mission. I think if you give people
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.420]   great tools and teach them to use them or don't even teach them, they'll figure it out
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.940]   and let them go build an incredible future for each other with that, that's a big deal.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.660]   So if we can keep putting free or low cost or free and low cost powerful AI tools out
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:43.860]   in the world, I think that's a huge deal for how we fulfill the mission.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.380]   Open source or not, yeah, I think we should open source some stuff and not other stuff.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.340]   It does become this religious battle line where nuance is hard to have, but I think
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.540]   nuance is the right answer.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.340]   So he said, change your name to closed AI and I'll drop the lawsuit. I mean, is it going
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:06.180]   to become this battleground in the land of memes about the name?
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:18.380]   I think that speaks to the seriousness with which Elon means the lawsuit. I mean, that's
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.580]   an astonishing thing to say, I think.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.620]   I don't think the lawsuit, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the lawsuit
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:32.300]   is legally serious. It's more to make a point about the future of AGI and the company that's
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.180]   currently leading the way.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.700]   So look, I mean, Grok had not open sourced anything until people pointed out it was a
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.740]   little bit hypocritical and then he announced that Grok will open source things this week.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.860]   I don't think open source versus not is what this is really about for him.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.060]   Well, we'll talk about open source and not. I do think maybe criticizing the competition
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.500]   is great, just talking a little shit, that's great, but friendly competition versus like,
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.700]   I personally hate lawsuits.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   Look, I think this whole thing is like unbecoming of the builder and I respect Elon as one of
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:15.220]   the great builders of our time. I know he knows what it's like to have haters attack
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.700]   him and it makes me extra sad he's doing it to us.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.660]   Yeah, he's one of the greatest builders of all time, potentially the greatest builder
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.660]   of all time.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.220]   It makes me sad. I think it makes a lot of people sad. There's a lot of people who've
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.140]   really looked up to him for a long time and I said in some interview or something that
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.780]   I missed the old Elon and the number of messages I got being like, that exactly encapsulates
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.780]   how I feel.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:45.100]   I think he should just win. He should just make Grok beat GPT and then GPT beats Grok
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.620]   and it's just a competition and it's beautiful for everybody. But on the question of open
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.540]   source, do you think there's a lot of companies playing with this idea? It's quite interesting.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:03.860]   I would say meta, surprisingly, has led the way on this or at least took the first step
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:09.740]   in the game of chess of really open sourcing the model. Of course, it's not the state of
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:16.900]   the art model, but open sourcing llama and Google is flirting with the idea of open sourcing
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:22.180]   a smaller version. What are the pros and cons of open sourcing? Have you played around with
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.180]   this idea?
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.300]   I think there is definitely a place for open source models, particularly smaller models
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.900]   that people can run locally. I think there's huge demand for. I think there will be some
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.780]   open source models, there will be some closed source models. It won't be unlike other ecosystems
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.780]   in that way.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:44.180]   I listened to an all-in podcast talking about this lawsuit and all that kind of stuff and
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   they were more concerned about the precedent of going from non-profit to this cap for profit.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.620]   What precedent does that set for other startups?
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:01.060]   I would heavily discourage any startup that was thinking about starting as a non-profit
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.820]   and adding a for-profit arm later. I'd heavily discourage them from doing that. I don't think
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.460]   we'll set a precedent here.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.580]   Okay. Most startups should go just-
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.740]   For sure. Again, if we knew what was going to happen, we would have done that too.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:19.500]   In theory, if you dance beautifully here, there's some tax incentives or whatever.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.860]   I don't think that's how most people think about these things.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.540]   So it's not possible to save a lot of money for a startup if you do it this way?
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.700]   No, I think there's laws that would make that pretty difficult.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:37.540]   Where do you hope this goes with Elon? This tension, this dance, where do you hope this?
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:44.140]   If we go one, two, three years from now, your relationship with him on a personal level
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:50.860]   too, like friendship, friendly competition, just all this kind of stuff.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:34:03.500]   Yeah, I'd really respect Elon. And I hope that years in the future, we have an amicable
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   relationship.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:13.340]   Yeah, I hope you guys have an amicable relationship this month. And just compete and win. And
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:20.300]   explore these ideas together. I do suppose there's competition for talent or whatever,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:29.580]   but it should be friendly competition. Just build cool shit. And Elon is pretty good at
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.980]   building cool shit, but so are you.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:40.300]   So speaking of cool shit, Sora, there's like a million questions I could ask. First of
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.700]   all, it's amazing. It truly is amazing. On a product level, but also just on a philosophical
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:52.780]   level. So let me just, technical/philosophical, ask, what do you think it understands about
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:35:01.580]   the world more or less than GPT-4, for example? The world model, when you train on these patches
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.100]   versus language tokens.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:10.820]   I think all of these models understand something more about the world model than most of us
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.580]   give them credit for. And because there are also very clear things they just don't understand
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.460]   or don't get right, it's easy to look at the weaknesses, see through the veil and say,
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:26.340]   "Oh, this is all fake." But it's not all fake, it's just some of it works and some of it
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:31.860]   doesn't work. I remember when I started first watching Sora videos, and I would see a person
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.540]   walk in front of something for a few seconds and occlude it, and then walk away and the
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.820]   same thing was still there. I was like, "Oh, this is pretty good." Or there's examples
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:47.100]   where the underlying physics looks so well-represented over a lot of steps in a sequence. It's like,
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.300]   "Oh, this is quite impressive."
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.740]   But fundamentally, these models are just getting better, and that will keep happening. If you
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.300]   look at the trajectory from Dali 1 to 2 to 3 to Sora, there were a lot of people that
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.540]   were dunked on each person, saying, "It can't do this, it can't do that," and look at it
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   now.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:12.340]   Well, the thing you just mentioned is with occlusions, is basically modeling the physics
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.500]   of the three-dimensional physics of the world sufficiently well to capture those kinds of
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   things?
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   Well...
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.820]   Or maybe you can tell me, in order to deal with occlusions, what does the world model
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.820]   need to...
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.060]   Yeah, so what I would say is it's doing something to deal with occlusions really well. What
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.700]   I represent that it has a great underlying 3D model of the world, it's a little bit more
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.700]   of a stretch.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.060]   But can you get there through just these kinds of two-dimensional training data approaches?
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.660]   It looks like this approach is going to go surprisingly far. I don't want to speculate
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.260]   too much about what limits it will surmount and which it won't, but...
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:50.560]   What are some interesting limitations of the system that you've seen? I mean, there's been
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.060]   some fun ones you've posted.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.460]   There's all kinds of fun. I mean, like, you know, cats sprouting an extra limit at random
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.780]   points in a video. Pick what you want, but there's still a lot of problems, a lot of
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   weaknesses.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:09.220]   Do you think that's a fundamental flaw of the approach? Or is it just, you know, bigger
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:17.340]   model or better, like, technical details or better data, more data, is going to solve
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   the cats sprouting?
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.460]   I would say yes to both. Like, I think there is something about the approach which just
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.060]   seems to feel different from how we think and learn and whatever. And then also, I think
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.700]   it'll get better with skill.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.860]   Like I mentioned, LLMs have tokens, text tokens, and Sora has visual patches. So it converts
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:41.780]   all visual data, diverse kinds of visual data, videos, and images into patches. Is the training
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.220]   to the degree you can say fully self-supervised? Or is there some manual labeling going on?
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.780]   Like, what's the involvement of humans in all this?
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:58.100]   I mean, without saying anything specific about the Sora approach, we use lots of human data
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.900]   in our work.
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:07.780]   But not intranet-scale data. So lots of humans. Lots is a complicated word, Sam.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.740]   I think lots is a fair word in this case.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.860]   It doesn't, because to me, lots, like, listen, I'm an introvert, and when I hang out with
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.460]   like three people, that's a lot of people. And four people, that's a lot. But I suppose
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.900]   you mean more than...
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.060]   More than three people work on labeling the data for these models, yeah.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:32.300]   But fundamentally, there's a lot of self-supervised learning. Because what you mentioned in the
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:39.100]   technical report is intranet-scale data. That's another beautiful, it's like poetry. So it's
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:45.140]   a lot of data that's not human-labeled, it's like, it's self-supervised in that way. And
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.780]   then the question is, how much data is there on the intranet that could be used in this,
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:57.860]   that is conducive to this kind of self-supervised way? If only we knew the details of the self-supervised.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.660]   Do you, have you considered opening it up a little more? Details?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.620]   We have. You mean for Sora specifically?
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:12.180]   Sora specifically, because it's so interesting that, like, can this, can the same magic of
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.700]   LLMs now start moving towards visual data? And what does that take to do that?
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.220]   I mean, it looks to me like yes. But we have more work to do.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:28.060]   Sure. What are the dangers? Why are you concerned about releasing the system? What are some
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.460]   possible dangers of this?
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.540]   I mean, frankly speaking, one thing we have to do before releasing the system is just
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:40.300]   like, get it to work at a level of efficiency that will deliver the scale people are gonna
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.980]   want from this. So I don't want to like downplay that. And there's still a ton, ton of work
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   to do there. But, you know, you can imagine like issues with deep fakes, misinformation.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.180]   Like we try to be a thoughtful company about what we put out into the world. And it doesn't
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.300]   take much thought to think about the ways this can go badly.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.060]   There's a lot of tough questions here. You're dealing in a very tough space. Do you think
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.820]   training AI should be or is fair use under copyright law?
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.220]   I think the question behind that question is, do people who create valuable data deserve
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:23.740]   to have some way that they get compensated for use of it? And that I think the answer
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:29.700]   is yes. I don't know yet what the answer is. People have proposed a lot of different things.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:35.780]   We've tried some different models. But, you know, if I'm like an artist, for example,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:41.940]   A, I would like to be able to opt out of people generating art in my style. And B, if they
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.180]   do generate art in my style, I'd like to have some economic model associated with that.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.500]   Yeah, it's that transition from CDs to Napster to Spotify. We have to figure out some kind
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   of model.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.060]   The model changes, but people have got to get paid.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.940]   Well, there should be some kind of incentive, if we zoom out even more, for humans to keep
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.580]   doing cool shit.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.820]   Something I worry about, humans are going to do cool shit, and society is going to find
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:12.420]   some way to reward it. That seems pretty hardwired. We want to create. We want to be useful. We
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.220]   want to achieve status in whatever way. That's not going anywhere, I don't think.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:24.660]   But the reward might not be monetary, financial. It might be like fame and celebration of other
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.660]   cool people.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.100]   Maybe financial in some other way. Again, I don't think we've seen the last evolution
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.540]   of how the economic system is going to work.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.700]   Yeah, but artists and creators are worried. When they see Sora, they're like, "Holy shit."
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.500]   Sure. Artists were also super worried when photography came out. And then photography
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   became a new art form, and people made a lot of money taking pictures. I think things like
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.320]   that will keep happening. People will use the new tools in new ways.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:56.040]   If we just look on YouTube or something like this, how much of that will be using Sora-like
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.780]   AI-generated content, do you think, in the next five years?
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.260]   People talk about how many jobs they're going to do in five years. And the framework that
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.300]   people have is what percentage of current jobs are just going to be totally replaced
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.100]   by some AI doing the job. The way I think about it is not what percent of jobs AI will
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.760]   do, but what percent of tasks will AI do, and over what time horizon.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.340]   So if you think of all of the five-second tasks in the economy, the five-minute tasks,
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:30.820]   the five-hour tasks, maybe even the five-day tasks, how many of those can AI do? I think
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:37.180]   that's a way more interesting, impactful, important question than how many jobs AI can
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:43.020]   do. Because it is a tool that will work at increasing levels of sophistication and over
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.280]   longer and longer time horizons for more and more tasks, and let people operate at a higher
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.100]   level of abstraction. So maybe people are way more efficient at the job they do, and
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.740]   at some point, that's not just a quantitative change, but it's a qualitative one, too, about
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.380]   the kinds of problems you can keep in your head.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:06.300]   I think that for videos on YouTube, it'll be the same. Many videos, maybe most of them,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.100]   will use AI tools in the production, but they'll still be fundamentally driven by a person
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:17.540]   thinking about it, putting it together, doing parts of it, sort of directing and running
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.540]   it.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.540]   That's interesting. I mean, it's scary, but it's interesting to think about. I tend to
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.940]   believe that humans like to watch other humans, or other human-like things.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.500]   Humans really care about other humans a lot.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:36.740]   Yeah. If there's a cooler thing that's better than a human, humans care about that for,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.420]   like, two days, and then they go back to humans.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.900]   That seems very deeply wired.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:47.300]   It's the whole chess thing. Yeah, but no, let's, everybody keep playing chess. And let's
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.140]   ignore the elephant in the room that humans are really bad at chess, relative to AI systems.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.140]   We still run races, and cars are much faster. I mean, there's like a lot of examples.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:02.660]   Yeah. And maybe it'll just be tooling, like, in the Adobe suite type of way, where it can
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:08.940]   just make videos much easier, all that kind of stuff. Listen, I hate being in front of
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:12.900]   the camera. If I can figure out a way to not be in front of the camera, I would love it.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.580]   Unfortunately, it'll take a while. Like that, generating faces, it's getting there. But
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.620]   generating faces in video format is tricky, when it's specific people versus generic people.
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:34.020]   Let me ask you about GPT-4. There's so many questions. First of all, also amazing. Looking
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:39.300]   back, it'll probably be this kind of historic pivotal moment with 3, 5, and 4, which had
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.300]   GPT.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.620]   Maybe 3, 5 will be the pivotal moment, I don't know. Hard to say that looking forward.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.460]   We never know. That's the annoying thing about the future. It's hard to predict. But for
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:54.940]   me, looking back, GPT-4, Chad, GPT is pretty damn impressive. Like, historically impressive.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:06.020]   So allow me to ask, what's been the most impressive capabilities of GPT-4 to you, and GPT-4 Turbo?
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.020]   I think it kind of sucks.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.340]   Typical human also. Gotten used to an awesome thing.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:19.500]   No, I think it is an amazing thing. But relative to where we need to get to, and where I believe
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:27.860]   we will get to, at the time of GPT-3, people were like, "Oh, this is amazing. This is this
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:36.580]   marvel of technology." And it is. It was. But now we have GPT-4, and look at GPT-3, that's
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:43.260]   unimaginably horrible. I expect that the delta between 5 and 4 will be the same as between
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:49.660]   4 and 3. And I think it is our job to live a few years in the future and remember that
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:57.780]   the tools we have now are going to kind of suck looking backwards at them. And we make
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.700]   sure the future is better.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.740]   What are the most glorious ways that GPT-4 sucks?
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.380]   What are the best things it can do?
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.460]   What are the best things it can do, and the limits of those best things that allow you
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.340]   to say it sucks, therefore gives you inspiration and hope for the future?
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:22.580]   You know, one thing I've been using it for more recently is sort of like a brainstorming
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   partner.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.940]   Yeah. I was for that.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:32.060]   There's a glimmer of something amazing in there. I don't think it gets – when people
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.420]   talk about what it does, they're like, "Oh, it helps me code more productively. It helps
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:42.420]   me write faster and better. It helps me translate from this language to another." All these
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:51.620]   amazing things. But there's something about the kind of creative brainstorming partner
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.120]   – I need to come up with a name for this thing. I need to think about this problem
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.500]   in a different way. I'm not sure what to do here – that I think gives a glimpse of something
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.420]   I hope to see more of.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:10.460]   One of the other things that you can see a very small glimpse of is when it can help
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.660]   on longer-horizon tasks. You know, break down something into multiple steps, maybe execute
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:20.660]   some of those steps, search the internet, write code, whatever, put that together. When
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.500]   that works, which is not very often, it's very magical.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.940]   The iterative back-and-forth with a human. It works a lot for me. What do you mean?
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.580]   Iterative back-and-forth with a human, it can get more often. When it can go do a 10-step
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:37.140]   problem on its own. It doesn't work for that too often. Sometimes.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.580]   But multiple layers of abstraction, or do you mean just sequential?
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:45.500]   Both. To break it down and then do things at different layers of abstraction and put
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:53.740]   them together. Look, I don't want to downplay the accomplishment of GPT-4, but I don't
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.860]   want to overstate it either. I think this point that we are on an exponential curve,
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:03.980]   we will look back relatively soon at GPT-4, like we look back at GPT-3 now.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:13.060]   That said, I mean, chat-GPT was the transition to where people started to believe it. There
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:19.380]   is an uptick of believing. Not internally at OpenAI, perhaps. There's believers here.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:23.140]   In that sense, I do think it'll be a moment where a lot of the world went from not believing
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:30.620]   to believing. That was more about the chat-GPT interface, and by the interface and product,
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:35.420]   I also mean the post-training of the model, and how we tune it to be helpful to you, and
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.380]   how to use it, than the underlying model itself.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:45.760]   How much of those two, each of those things are important? The underlying model and the
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:53.180]   RLHF, or something of that nature that tunes it to be more compelling to the human, more
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.380]   effective and productive for the human.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:01.180]   I mean, they're both super important, but the RLHF, the post-training step, the little
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:06.380]   wrapper of things that, from a compute perspective, little wrapper of things that we do on top
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.700]   of the base model, even though it's a huge amount of work, that's really important, to
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:16.100]   say nothing of the product that we build around it.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:22.580]   In some sense, we did have to do two things. We had to invent the underlying technology,
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:30.860]   and then we had to figure out how to make it into a product people would love, which
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.460]   is not just about the actual product work itself, but this whole other step of how you
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.180]   align it and make it useful.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:42.380]   How you make the scale work, where a lot of people can use it at the same time, all that
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.380]   kind of stuff.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:48.940]   And that. That was a known difficult thing. We knew we were going to have to scale it
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.940]   up. We had to go do two things that had never been done before, that were both, I would
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.780]   say, quite significant achievements, and then a lot of things like scaling it up that other
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.540]   companies have had to do before.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:11.860]   How does the context window of going from 8K to 128K tokens compare from GPT-4 to GPT-4
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.500]   Turbo?
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.700]   Most people don't need all the way to 128K most of the time. Although, if we dream into
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:23.820]   the distant future, we'll have a way distant future. We'll have context length of several
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.860]   billion. You will feed in all of your information, all of your history over time, and it'll just
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.220]   get to know you better and better, and that'll be great.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:38.140]   For now, the way people use these models, they're not doing that. People sometimes post
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:46.620]   in a paper or a significant fraction of a code repository or whatever. But most usage
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.420]   of the models is not using the long context most of the time.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:55.900]   I like that this is your "I have a dream" speech. One day, you'll be judged by the full
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:01.740]   context of your character, or of your whole lifetime. That's interesting. That's part
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.620]   of the expansion that you're hoping for, is a greater and greater context.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.980]   I saw this internet clip once. I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but it was Bill Gates
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:15.820]   talking about the amount of memory on some early computer. Maybe 64K, maybe 640K, something
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:22.620]   like that. Most of it was used for the screen buffer. He just couldn't seem genuine, couldn't
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.740]   imagine that the world would eventually need gigabytes of memory in a computer, or terabytes
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:37.100]   of memory in a computer. You always do just need to follow the exponential of technology.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:43.420]   We will find out how to use better technology. I can't really imagine what it's like right now
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:47.500]   for context links to go out to the billions someday. They might not literally go there,
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:54.460]   but effectively, it'll feel like that. But I know we'll use it and really not want to
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.980]   go back once we have it. Yeah. Even saying billions 10 years from now might seem dumb,
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:05.900]   because it'll be like trillions upon trillions. There'll be some kind of breakthrough
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:12.140]   that will effectively feel like infinite context. But even 120, I have to be honest,
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:17.580]   I haven't pushed it to that degree. Maybe putting in entire books, or parts of books and so on.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:23.420]   Papers. What are some interesting use cases of GPT-4 that you've seen?
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.580]   The thing that I find most interesting is not any particular use case that we can talk about those,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:35.420]   but it's people who... This is mostly younger people, but people who use it as their default
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.780]   start for any kind of knowledge work task. And it's the fact that it can do a lot of things
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.860]   reasonably well. You can use GPT-V, you can use it to help you write code, you can use it to help
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.420]   you do search, you can use it to edit a paper. The most interesting thing to me is the people
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:55.100]   who just use it as the start of their workflow. I do as well for many things. I use it as a
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:02.140]   reading partner for reading books. It helps me think through ideas, especially when the books
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:10.140]   are classics, so it's really well written about. I find it often to be significantly better than
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:16.620]   even Wikipedia on well-covered topics. It's somehow more balanced and more nuanced. Or maybe
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:21.820]   it's me, but it inspires me to think deeper than a Wikipedia article does. I'm not exactly sure what
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.380]   that is. You mentioned this collaboration. I'm not sure where the magic is, if it's in here,
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.900]   or if it's in there, or if it's somewhere in between. I'm not sure. But one of the things
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:37.820]   that concerns me for knowledge tasks when I start with GPT is I'll usually have to do fact-checking
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:48.140]   after, like check that it didn't come up with fake stuff. How do you figure that out, that GPT can
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:54.620]   come up with fake stuff that sounds really convincing? How do you ground it in truth?
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:54:01.900]   That's obviously an area of intense interest for us. I think it's going to get a lot better
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:06.060]   with upcoming versions, but we'll have to work on it, and we're not going to have it all solved
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:12.300]   this year. Well, the scary thing is as it gets better, you'll start not doing the fact-checking
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:17.660]   more and more, right? I'm of two minds about that. I think people are much more sophisticated
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:22.540]   users of technology than we often give them credit for, and people seem to really understand
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.620]   that GPT, any of these models, hallucinate some of the time, and if it's mission-critical,
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.780]   you've got to check it. Except journalists don't seem to understand that. I've seen journalists
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:36.940]   half-assedly just using GPT for... Of the long list of things I'd like to dunk on journalists
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:43.500]   for, this is not my top criticism of them. Well, I think the bigger criticism is perhaps
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.340]   the pressures and the incentives of being a journalist is that you have to work really
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:53.980]   quickly, and this is a shortcut. I would love our society to incentivize like... I would too.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.780]   Long, like a journalist, journalistic efforts that take days and weeks and rewards great,
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.820]   in-depth journalism. Also journalism that presents stuff in a balanced way where it's like,
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:10.540]   celebrates people while criticizing them, even though the criticism is the thing that gets
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:16.140]   clicks, and making shit up also gets clicks, and headlines that mischaracterize completely.
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:21.260]   I'm sure you have a lot of people dunking on... Well, all that drama probably got a lot of clicks.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:29.980]   Probably did. And that's a bigger problem about human civilization. I'd love to see solid,
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.620]   this is where we celebrate a bit more. You've given Chad GPT the ability to have memories,
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:40.300]   you've been playing with that, about previous conversations. And also the ability to turn off
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:45.980]   memory, which I wish I could do that sometimes, just turn on and off, depending. I guess sometimes
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:52.700]   alcohol can do that, but not optimally, I suppose. What have you seen through that,
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.380]   playing around with that idea of remembering conversations or not?
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:01.340]   We're very early in our explorations here, but I think what people want, or at least what I want
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:08.220]   for myself, is a model that gets to know me and gets more useful to me over time.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:14.220]   This is an early exploration. I think there's a lot of other things to do,
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:19.340]   but that's where we'd like to head. You'd like to use a model and over the course of your life,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:25.180]   or use a system, there'll be many models, and over the course of your life, it gets better and better.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.780]   Yeah, how hard is that problem? Because right now it's more like remembering
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:35.900]   little factoids and preferences and so on. What about remembering, don't you want GPT to remember
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:40.060]   all the shit you went through in November and all the drama?
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:40.940]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.340]   Because right now you're clearly blocking it out a little bit.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:49.420]   It's not just that I want it to remember that, I want it to integrate the lessons of that and
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   remind me in the future what to do differently or what to watch out for.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:03.260]   We all gain from experience over the course of our lives,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:08.940]   varying degrees, and I'd like my AI agent to gain with that experience too.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:15.900]   So if we go back and let ourselves imagine that trillions and trillions of context length,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:21.740]   if I can put every conversation I've ever had with anybody in my life in there, if I can have
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:26.540]   all of my emails input out, all of my input output in the context window every time I ask a question,
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.300]   that'd be pretty cool, I think.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:33.820]   Yeah, I think that would be very cool. People sometimes will hear that and be concerned about
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:41.740]   privacy. What do you think about that aspect of it? The more effective the AI becomes at really
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:47.500]   integrating all the experiences and all the data that happened to you and giving you advice?
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:52.140]   I think the right answer there is just user choice. Anything I want stricken from the record
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.020]   for my AI agent, I want to be able to take out. If I don't want it to remember anything,
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:02.140]   I want that too. You and I may have different opinions about where on that privacy utility
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.780]   trade-off for our own AI we want to be, which is totally fine. But I think the answer is just
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:12.940]   like really easy user choice. But there should be some high level of transparency from a company
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:18.540]   about the user choice. Because sometimes companies in the past have been kind of shady about like,
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:24.780]   "Eh, it's kind of presumed that we're collecting all your data and we're using it for a good
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:29.740]   reason, for advertisement and so on." But there's not a transparency about the details of that.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.540]   That's totally true. You mentioned earlier that I'm like blocking out the November stuff.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.900]   Just teasing you.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:42.940]   Well, I mean, I think it was a very traumatic thing and it did immobilize me
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:50.940]   for a long period of time. Definitely the hardest work that I've had to do was just keep working
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:55.660]   that period. Because I had to try to come back in here and put the pieces together while I was just
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:02.540]   in sort of shock and pain. Nobody really cares about that. I mean, the team gave me a pass and
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.660]   I was not working at my normal level. But there was a period where I was just like,
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:11.500]   it was really hard to have to do both. But I kind of woke up one morning and I was like,
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.020]   "This was a horrible thing to happen to me. I think I could just feel like a victim forever."
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:19.820]   Or I can say, "This is like the most important work I'll ever touch in my life and I need to
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:26.380]   get back to it." And it doesn't mean that I've repressed it because sometimes I wake in the
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:31.100]   middle of the night thinking about it, but I do feel like an obligation to keep moving forward.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:36.220]   Well, that's beautifully said, but there could be some linkering stuff in there. Like,
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:42.060]   what I would be concerned about is that trust thing that you mentioned,
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:48.220]   that being paranoid about people as opposed to just trusting everybody or most people,
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.540]   like using your gut. It's a tricky dance.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:50.940]   For sure.
[00:59:51.500 --> 01:00:00.540]   I mean, because I've seen in my part-time explorations, I've been diving deeply into
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:06.140]   the Zelensky administration, the Putin administration, and the dynamics there
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.820]   in wartime in a very highly stressful environment. And what happens is distrust
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:19.340]   and you isolate yourself both and you start to not see the world clearly. And that's a concern.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:24.060]   That's a human concern. You seem to have taken it in stride and kind of learned the good lessons
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:29.500]   and felt the love and let the love energize you, which is great, but still can linger in there.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:36.620]   There's just some questions I would love to ask your intuition about what's GPT able to do and
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:43.820]   not. So it's allocating approximately the same amount of compute for each token it generates.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:51.500]   Is there room there in this kind of approach to slower thinking, sequential thinking?
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.860]   I think there will be a new paradigm for that kind of thinking.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:01:00.140]   Will it be similar like architecturally as what we're seeing now with LLMs?
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.980]   Is it a layer on top of the LLMs?
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:08.220]   I can imagine many ways to implement that. I think that's less important
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.380]   than the question you were getting at, which is, do we need a way to do
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.540]   a slower kind of thinking where the answer doesn't have to get like,
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:24.620]   you know, it's like, I guess like spiritually, you could say that you want an AI to be able to think
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.860]   harder about a harder problem and answer more quickly about an easier problem. And I think
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.220]   that will be important. Is that like a human thought that we're just having? You should be
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.140]   able to think hard. Is that the wrong intuition? I suspect that's a reasonable intuition.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:42.860]   Interesting. So it's not possible once the GPT gets like GPT-7, we'll just be instantaneously
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.580]   be able to see, you know, here's the proof of Fermat's theorem.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:54.220]   It seems to me like you want to be able to allocate more compute to harder problems.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:59.500]   Like, it seems to me that a system knowing,
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:09.580]   if you ask a system like that, proof for Fermat's last theorem versus what's today's date,
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.140]   unless it already knew and had memorized the answer to the
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.500]   proof, assuming it's got to go figure that out, seems like that will take more compute.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.140]   But can it look like a basically LLM talking to itself, that kind of thing?
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:31.900]   Maybe. I mean, there's a lot of things that you could imagine working. What, like, what the right
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.500]   or the best way to do that will be? We don't know.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:44.780]   This does make me think of the mysterious, the lore behind Q*. What's this mysterious
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.740]   Q* project? Is it also in the same nuclear facility?
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:51.340]   There is no nuclear facility.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.780]   That's what a person with a nuclear facility always says.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.300]   I would love to have a secret nuclear facility. There isn't one.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.740]   All right.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.260]   Maybe someday.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.220]   Someday. All right.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.340]   One can dream.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.380]   OpenAI is not a good company at keeping secrets. It would be nice, you know,
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.860]   we're like been plagued by a lot of leaks, and it would be nice if we were able to have
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.900]   something like that.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.820]   Can you speak to what Q* is?
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.020]   We are not ready to talk about that.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.380]   See, but an answer like that means there's something to talk about.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.660]   It's very mysterious, Sam.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:25.420]   I mean, we work on all kinds of research.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:37.580]   We have said for a while that we think better reasoning in these systems is an important
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.860]   direction that we'd like to pursue.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.060]   We haven't cracked the code yet.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.900]   We're very interested in it.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:52.300]   Is there going to be moments, Q* or otherwise, where
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.500]   there's going to be leaps similar to JadGBT, where you're like…
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.340]   That's a good question.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.300]   What do I think about that?
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:05.900]   It's interesting.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.580]   To me, it all feels pretty continuous.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.460]   Right.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.500]   This is kind of a theme that you're saying is there's a gradual…
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.980]   You're basically gradually going up an exponential slope.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:19.500]   But from an outsider perspective, for me just watching it, it does feel like there's leaps.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.820]   But to you, there isn't.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.500]   I do wonder if we should have…
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.060]   Part of the reason that we deploy the way we do is that we think…
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.140]   We call it iterative deployment.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:37.740]   Rather than go build in secret until we got all the way to GPT-5, we decided to talk about GPT-1,
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.460]   2, 3, and 4.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.020]   Part of the reason there is I think AI and surprise don't go together.
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:48.620]   Also, the world, people, institutions, whatever you want to call it, need time to adapt and think
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.340]   about these things.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:56.860]   I think one of the best things that open AI has done is this strategy and we get the world to pay
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:04.380]   attention to the progress, to take AGI seriously, to think about what systems and structures and
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.300]   governance we want in place before we're under the gun and have to make a rush decision.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.180]   I think that's really good.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:15.900]   But the fact that people like you and others say you still feel like there are these leaps
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.820]   makes me think that maybe we should be doing our releasing even more iteratively.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.700]   I don't know what that would mean.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.820]   I don't have any answer ready to go.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:29.580]   But our goal is not to have shock updates to the world, the opposite.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.300]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.380]   More iterative would be amazing.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.380]   I think that's just beautiful for everybody.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.660]   But that's what we're trying to do.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.340]   That's our state of the strategy.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.860]   And I think we're somehow missing the mark.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   Maybe we should think about releasing GPT-5 in a different way or something like that.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.500]   Yeah, 4.71, 4.72.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.180]   But people tend to like to celebrate.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.380]   People celebrate birthdays.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.700]   I don't know if you know humans, but they kind of have these milestones.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.060]   I do know some humans.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.500]   People do like milestones.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.380]   I totally get that.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:05.260]   I think we like milestones too.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.020]   It's fun to say, declare victory on this one and go start the next thing.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.860]   But yeah, I feel like we're somehow getting this a little bit wrong.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.580]   So when is GPT-5 coming out again?
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.460]   I don't know.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.260]   That's the honest answer.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.180]   Oh, that's the honest answer.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.500]   Is it blink twice if it's this year?
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:33.100]   I also, we will release an amazing model this year.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.020]   I don't know what we'll call it.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:40.780]   So that goes to the question of what's the way we release this thing?
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:46.380]   We'll release over in the coming months, many different things.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:49.340]   I think they'll be very cool.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:54.940]   I think before we talk about like a GPT-5 like model called that or not called that
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.380]   or a little bit worse or a little bit better than what you'd expect from a GPT-5.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.980]   I know we have a lot of other important things to release first.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.540]   I don't know what to expect from GPT-5.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.660]   You're making me nervous and excited.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.420]   What are some of the biggest challenges and bottlenecks to overcome
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.740]   for whatever it ends up being called, but let's call it GPT-5?
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.980]   Just interesting to ask, what are, is it on the compute side?
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.020]   Is in the technical side?
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.780]   Always all of these, I was, you know, what's the one big unlock?
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.140]   Is it a bigger computer?
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.260]   Is it like a new secret?
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.140]   Is it something else?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.420]   It's all of these things together.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.460]   Like the thing that OpenAI I think does really well.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.660]   This is actually an original Ilio quote that I'm going to butcher, but it's something like
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:46.620]   we multiply 200 medium-sized things together into one giant thing.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.380]   So there's this distributed constant innovation happening.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.340]   So even on the technical side, like...
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.380]   Especially on the technical side.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.300]   So like even like detailed approaches, like you do detailed aspects of every...
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.460]   How does that work with different disparate teams and so on?
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:07.020]   Like how do they, how do the medium-sized things become one whole giant transformer?
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:07.980]   How does this...
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.260]   There's a few people who have to like think about putting the whole thing together,
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.140]   but a lot of people try to keep most of the picture in their head.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.700]   Oh, like the individual teams, individual contributors try to...
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.980]   At a high level, yeah.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:23.820]   You don't know exactly how every piece works, of course, but one thing I generally believe
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.940]   is that it's sometimes useful to zoom out and look at the entire map.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:33.500]   And I think this is true for like a technical problem.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.140]   I think this is true for like innovating in business.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:43.100]   But things come together in surprising ways and having an understanding of that whole picture,
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:47.580]   even if most of the time you're operating in the weeds in one area,
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:51.260]   pays off with surprising insights.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.980]   In fact, one of the things that I used to have, and I think was super valuable,
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:01.420]   was I used to have like a good map of that, all of the frontier,
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.420]   or most of the frontiers in the tech industry.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:09.100]   And I could sometimes see these connections or new things that were possible that if I were only,
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:13.500]   you know, deep in one area, I wouldn't be able to like have the idea for it because
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.540]   I wouldn't have all the data.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.860]   And I don't really have that much anymore.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.220]   I'm like super deep now.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.140]   But I know that it's a valuable thing.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.180]   You're not the man you used to be, Sam.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.780]   Very different job now than what I used to have.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:33.340]   - Speaking of zooming out, let's zoom out to another cheeky thing,
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.620]   but profound thing perhaps that you said.
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.860]   You tweeted about needing $7 trillion.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.780]   - I did not tweet about that.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.340]   I never said like we're raising $7 trillion, blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.220]   - Oh, that's somebody else.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:46.540]   - Yeah.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.220]   - Oh, but you said fuck it, maybe eight, I think.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.180]   - Okay, I meme like once there's like misinformation out in the world.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.460]   - Oh, you meme.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:59.980]   But sort of misinformation may have a foundation of like insight there.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.740]   - Look, I think compute is gonna be the currency of the future.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.180]   I think it will be maybe the most precious commodity in the world.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:12.140]   And I think we should be investing heavily to make a lot more compute.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.740]   Compute is,
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:21.420]   it's an unusual, I think it's gonna be an unusual market.
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.180]   You know, people think about
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:30.300]   the market for like chips for mobile phones or something like that.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.500]   And you can say that, okay, there's 8 billion people in the world,
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.700]   maybe 7 billion of them have phones, maybe there are 6 billion, let's say.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.460]   They upgrade every two years.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.660]   So the market per year is 3 billion system-on-chip for smartphones.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:45.500]   And if you make 30 billion, you will not sell 10 times as many phones
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.860]   because most people have one phone.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:51.900]   But compute is different.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.340]   Like intelligence is gonna be more like energy or something like that,
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.660]   where the only thing that I think makes sense to
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:04.700]   talk about is at price X, the world will use this much compute.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.780]   And at price Y, the world will use this much compute.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.020]   Because if it's really cheap, I'll have it like reading my email all day,
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.820]   like giving me suggestions about what I maybe should think about or work on
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.980]   and trying to cure cancer.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.060]   And if it's really expensive, maybe I'll only use it,
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.980]   will only use it to try to cure cancer.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.580]   So I think the world is gonna want a tremendous amount of compute.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.300]   And there's a lot of parts of that that are hard.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.140]   Energy is the hardest part.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.780]   Building data centers is also hard.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.660]   The supply chain is harder than, of course, fabricating enough chips is hard.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:37.340]   But this seems to me where things are going.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.540]   Like we're gonna want an amount of compute that's just hard to reason about right now.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.580]   - How do you solve the energy puzzle?
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.060]   Nuclear?
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:46.780]   - That's what I believe.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:47.340]   - Fusion?
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.540]   - That's what I believe.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:49.900]   - Nuclear fusion.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.400]   - Yeah.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.620]   - Who's gonna solve that?
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.300]   - I think Helion's doing the best work,
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.620]   but I'm happy there's like a race for fusion right now.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.140]   Nuclear fission, I think, is also like quite amazing.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.100]   And I hope as a world, we can re-embrace that.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.260]   It's really sad to me how the history of that went
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.420]   and hope we get back to it in a meaningful way.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.220]   - So to you, part of the puzzle is nuclear fission,
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.700]   like nuclear reactors as we currently have them.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.420]   And a lot of people are terrified because of Chernobyl and so on.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.060]   - Well, I think we should make new reactors.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.340]   I think it's just like it's a shame that industry kind of ground to a halt.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.860]   - And what just mass hysteria is how you explain the halt?
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.580]   - Yeah.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:29.340]   - I don't know if you know humans, but that's one of the dangers.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.980]   That's one of the security threats for nuclear fission
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.020]   is humans seem to be really afraid of it.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:40.700]   And that's something we have to incorporate into the calculus of it.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.740]   So we have to kind of win people over and to show how safe it is.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.740]   - I worry about that for AI.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.180]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.140]   - I think some things are going to go theatrically wrong with AI.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:56.140]   I don't know what the percent chance is that I eventually get shot, but it's not zero.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.740]   - Oh, like we want to stop this.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.700]   - Maybe.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:06.060]   - How do you decrease the theatrical nature of it?
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.100]   You know, I've already starting to hear rumblings
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:15.180]   because I do talk to people on both sides of the political spectrum,
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:18.140]   hear rumblings where it's going to be politicized, AI.
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.180]   It's going to be politicized.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.300]   It really worries me because then it's like maybe the right is against AI
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:28.060]   and the left is for AI because it's going to help the people
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.500]   or whatever the narrative and formulation is that really worries me.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.380]   And then the theatrical nature of it can be leveraged fully.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.180]   How do you fight that?
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:41.500]   - I think it will get caught up in like left versus right wars.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.020]   I don't know exactly what that's going to look like,
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.700]   but I think that's just what happens with anything of consequence, unfortunately.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.420]   What I meant more about theatrical risks is like AI is going to have,
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.980]   I believe, tremendously more good consequences than bad ones,
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.180]   but it is going to have bad ones.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:05.340]   And there'll be some bad ones that are bad, but not theatrical.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.420]   You know, like a lot more people have died of air pollution
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.140]   than nuclear reactors, for example.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.740]   But we worry.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.020]   Most people worry more about living next to a nuclear reactor than a coal plant.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.620]   But something about the way we're wired is that
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.140]   although there's many different kinds of risks we have to confront,
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:30.060]   the ones that make a good climax scene of a movie carry much more weight with us
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:34.220]   than the ones that are very bad over a long period of time, but on a slow burn.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.340]   - Well, that's why truth matters.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.220]   And hopefully AI can help us see the truth of things,
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.140]   to have balance, to understand what are the actual risks,
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.900]   what are the actual dangers of things in the world.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.300]   What are the pros and cons of the competition in this space
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.780]   and competing with Google, Meta, XAI, and others?
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:15:00.140]   - I think I have a pretty straightforward answer to this
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.660]   that maybe I can think of more nuance later,
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.940]   but the pros seem obvious,
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:07.340]   which is that we get better products and more innovation faster and cheaper,
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.860]   and all the reasons competition is good.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.740]   And the con is that I think if we're not careful,
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:20.860]   it could lead to an increase in sort of an arms race that I'm nervous about.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.780]   - Do you feel the pressure of the arms race, like in some negative--
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.780]   - Definitely in some ways, for sure.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:32.540]   We spend a lot of time talking about the need to prioritize safety.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.980]   And I've said for like a long time that I think,
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:42.860]   if you think of a quadrant of slow timelines to the start of AGI,
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.300]   long timelines, and then a short takeoff or a fast takeoff,
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.980]   I think short timelines, slow takeoff is the safest quadrant
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.420]   and the one I'd most like us to be in.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.540]   But I do want to make sure we get that slow takeoff.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:59.180]   - Part of the problem I have with this kind of slight beef with Elon
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.260]   is that there's silos are created in it,
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.300]   as opposed to collaboration on the safety aspect of all of this.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.740]   It tends to go into silos and closed open source, perhaps in the model.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.500]   - Elon says at least that he cares a great deal about AI safety
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.940]   and is really worried about it.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:19.260]   And I assume that he's not gonna race on safely.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:24.940]   - Yeah, but collaboration here I think is really beneficial for everybody on that front.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.340]   - Not really the thing he's most known for.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.500]   - Well, he is known for caring about humanity
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.660]   and humanity benefits from collaboration.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.940]   And so there's always attention and incentives and motivations.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:41.180]   And in the end, I do hope humanity prevails.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:44.700]   - I was thinking, someone just reminded me the other day
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.780]   about how the day that he got like surpassed Jeff Bezos
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.700]   for like richest person in the world, he tweeted a silver medal at Jeff Bezos.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:57.900]   I hope we have less stuff like that as people start to work on.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:58.700]   - I agree.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:16:59.260]   - Towards AGI.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.780]   - I think Elon is a friend and he's a beautiful human being
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:06.940]   and one of the most important humans ever, that stuff is not good.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:10.940]   - The amazing stuff about Elon is amazing and I super respect him.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.540]   I think we need him, all of us should be rooting for him
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.820]   and need him to step up as a leader through this next phase.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:21.020]   - Yeah, I hope you can have one without the other,
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.140]   but sometimes humans are flawed and complicated and all that kind of stuff.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.540]   - There's a lot of really great leaders throughout history.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:32.220]   - Yeah, and we can each be the best version of ourselves and strive to do so.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:38.940]   - Let me ask you, Google, with the help of search,
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:45.340]   has been dominating the past 20 years, I think it's fair to say,
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.780]   in terms of the access, the world's access to information,
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.060]   how we interact and so on.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.180]   And one of the nerve-wracking things for Google,
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.580]   but for the entirety of people in this space,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.100]   is thinking about how are people going to access information?
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:17:59.340]   - Yeah.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:04.700]   - Like you said, people show up to GPT as a starting point.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:10.300]   So is OpenAI going to really take on this thing that Google started 20 years ago,
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.380]   which is how do we get--
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.420]   - I find that boring.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:19.660]   If the question is, if we can build a better search engine than Google or whatever,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:25.740]   then sure, we should go, people should use a better product.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:31.580]   But I think that would so understate what this can be.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.220]   You know, Google shows you like 10 blue links,
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.380]   well, like 13 ads and then 10 blue links,
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.740]   and that's like one way to find information.
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:48.940]   But the thing that's exciting to me is not that we can go build a better copy of Google search,
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.380]   but that maybe there's just some much better way to help people
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.700]   find and act and on and synthesize information.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.740]   Actually, I think chat GPT is that for some use cases,
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.340]   and hopefully we'll make it be like that for a lot more use cases.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.460]   But I don't think it's that interesting to say like,
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.660]   how do we go do a better job of giving you like 10 ranked
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.420]   web pages to look at than what Google does?
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:14.860]   Maybe it's really interesting to go say,
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.500]   how do we help you get the answer or the information you need?
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.980]   How do we help create that in some cases,
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.900]   synthesize that and others are pointed to it,
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.940]   and yet others.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:30.140]   But a lot of people have tried to just make a better search engine than Google.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.780]   And it is a hard technical problem.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.980]   It is a hard branding problem.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.340]   It's a hard ecosystem problem.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.300]   I don't think the world needs another copy of Google.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:44.300]   - And integrating a chat client, like a chat GPT with a search engine.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.020]   - That's cooler.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.900]   - It's cool, but it's tricky.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.260]   It's like, if you just do it simply, it's awkward.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.700]   Because like, if you just shove it in there, it can be awkward.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.420]   - As you might guess, we are interested in how to do that well.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.420]   That would be an example of a cool thing.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.420]   - How to do that well, like a heterogeneous, like integrating.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.980]   - The intersection of LLMs plus search.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.860]   I don't think anyone has cracked the code on yet.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:11.740]   I would love to go do that.
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:12.540]   I think that would be cool.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.660]   - Yeah.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.260]   What about the ad side?
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.540]   Have you ever considered monetization?
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.100]   - You know, I kind of hate ads just as like an aesthetic choice.
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:26.620]   I think ads needed to happen on the internet for a bunch of reasons to get it going.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:28.860]   But it's a more mature industry.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.500]   The world is richer now.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:38.060]   I like that people pay for chat GPT and know that the answers they're getting
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.140]   are not influenced by advertisers.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:45.740]   There is, I'm sure there's an ad unit that makes sense for LLMs.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:50.060]   And I'm sure there's a way to like participate in the transaction stream
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.340]   in an unbiased way that is okay to do.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:58.540]   But it's also easy to think about like the dystopic visions of the future
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.340]   where you ask chat GPT something and it says,
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.500]   oh, here's, you know, you should think about buying this product
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.420]   or you should think about, you know, this going here for your vacation or whatever.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:10.860]   And I don't know, like,
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.820]   we have a very simple business model and I like it.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.180]   And I know that I'm not the product.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:23.180]   Like I know I'm paying and that's how the business model works.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:31.420]   And when I go use like Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other great product,
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.020]   but ad supported great product,
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.140]   I don't love that.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.460]   And I think it gets worse, not better in a world with AI.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.060]   - Yeah, I mean, I can imagine AI would be better
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.780]   at showing the best kind of version of ads,
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.620]   not in a dystopic future,
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.740]   but where the ads are for things you actually need.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:56.700]   But then does that system always result in the ads
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.340]   driving the kind of stuff that's shown all that it's...
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   Yeah, I think it was a really bold move of Wikipedia
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.860]   not to do advertisements,
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:08.780]   but then it makes it very challenging as a business model.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.500]   So you're saying the current thing with open AI
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.380]   is sustainable from a business perspective?
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.300]   - Well, we have to figure out how to grow,
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.340]   but it looks like we're gonna figure that out.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:23.500]   If the question is, do I think we can have a great business
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.980]   that pays for our compute needs without ads,
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.100]   that I think the answer is yes.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:32.940]   - Well, that's promising.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.580]   I also just don't want to completely throw out ads as a...
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:41.500]   I guess I'm saying I have a bias against them.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:47.820]   - Yeah, I have also a bias and just a skepticism in general.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.900]   And in terms of interface,
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.220]   'cause I personally just have like a spiritual
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:55.660]   dislike of crappy interfaces,
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.660]   which is why AdSense when it first came out
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.260]   was a big leap forward
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.740]   versus like animated banners or whatever.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.820]   But like, it feels like there should be
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.340]   many more leaps forward in advertisement
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.900]   that doesn't interfere with the consumption of the content
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.820]   and doesn't interfere in the big fundamental way,
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.420]   which is like what you were saying.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.460]   Like it will manipulate the truth to suit the advertisers.
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:26.300]   Let me ask you about safety, but also bias
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.340]   and like safety in the short term, safety in the long term.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.820]   The Gemini One 5 came out recently.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.420]   There's a lot of drama around it,
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.780]   speaking of theatrical things,
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:40.860]   and it generated black Nazis and black founding fathers.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:46.700]   I think fair to say it was a bit on the ultra woke side.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.700]   So that's a concern for people
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.980]   that if there is a human layer within companies
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:57.260]   that modifies the safety or the harm caused by a model,
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.860]   that they will introduce a lot of bias
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:04.220]   that fits sort of an ideological lean within a company.
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.740]   How do you deal with that?
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.500]   - I mean, we work super hard not to do things like that.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.100]   We've made our own mistakes.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:11.900]   We'll make others.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.740]   I assume Google will learn from this one,
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.460]   still make others.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:19.900]   It is all, like these are not easy problems.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.780]   One thing that we've been thinking about more and more is,
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.940]   I think this was a great idea somebody here had,
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.380]   like it'd be nice to write out
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   what the desired behavior of a model is,
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.140]   make that public, take input on it.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.620]   Say, here's how this model is supposed to behave
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.140]   and explain the edge cases too.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.260]   And then when a model is not behaving
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.140]   in a way that you want,
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.540]   it's at least clear about whether it's a bug
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.620]   the company should fix or behaving as intended
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.060]   and you should debate the policy.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:48.060]   And right now it can sometimes be caught in between.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.300]   Like black Nazis, obviously ridiculous,
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.220]   but there are a lot of other kind of subtle things
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.900]   that you could make a judgment call on either way.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.860]   - Yeah, but sometimes if you write it out
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.980]   and make it public, you can use kind of language
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.020]   that's, you know, the Google's AI principles
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:03.820]   are very high level.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.260]   - That doesn't, that's not what I'm talking about.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:05.900]   That doesn't work.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.940]   Like I'd have to say, you know,
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:09.500]   when you ask it to do thing X,
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.860]   it's supposed to respond in way Y.
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:14.860]   - So like literally who's better, Trump or Biden?
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.340]   What's the expected response for a model?
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.620]   Like something like very concrete.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.140]   - Yeah, I'm open to a lot of ways
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.020]   a model could behave then,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.540]   but I think you should have to say, you know,
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.180]   here's the principle
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.380]   and here's what it should say in that case.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.980]   - That would be really nice.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.940]   That'd be really nice.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.460]   And then everyone kind of agrees
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.340]   because there's this anecdotal data
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.900]   that people pull out all the time.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.020]   And if there's some clarity
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.300]   about other representative anecdotal examples,
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:38.940]   you can define.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.220]   - And then when it's a bug, it's a bug
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.580]   and, you know, the company can fix that.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.220]   - Right.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.500]   Then it'd be much easier to deal
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.420]   with a black Nazi type of image generation
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.940]   if there's great examples.
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:53.340]   So San Francisco is a bit of an ideological bubble,
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.500]   tech in general as well.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.180]   Do you feel the pressure of that
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.220]   within a company that there's like a lean
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.820]   towards the left politically
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:06.220]   that affects the product, that affects the teams?
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:09.100]   - I feel very lucky that we don't have the challenges
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.260]   at OpenAI that I have heard of
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:12.620]   at a lot of other companies.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.420]   I think part of it is like
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.300]   every company has got some ideological thing.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.980]   We have one about AGI and belief in that
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.260]   and it pushes out some others.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.500]   Like we are much less caught up in the culture war
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.900]   than I've heard about at a lot of other companies.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.620]   San Francisco's a mess in all sorts of ways, of course.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.900]   - So that doesn't infiltrate OpenAI as--
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.820]   - I'm sure it does in all sorts of subtle ways,
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.020]   but not in the obvious.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:45.260]   Like I think we've had our flare-ups for sure,
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:45.900]   like any company,
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.020]   but I don't think we have anything
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.340]   like what I hear about happen at other companies here.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.740]   - So what's in general is the process
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.820]   for the bigger question of safety.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:55.980]   How do you provide that layer that protects the model
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.660]   from doing crazy, dangerous things?
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:03.420]   - I think there will come a point
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.740]   where that's mostly what we think about the whole company.
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:06.620]   And it won't be like,
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.220]   it's not like you have one safety team.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.380]   It's like when we shipped GPT-4,
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.260]   that took the whole company,
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.300]   thinking about all these different aspects
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.100]   and how they fit together.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.460]   And I think it's gonna take that.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:17.980]   More and more of the company
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.340]   thinks about those issues all the time.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.380]   - That's literally what humans will be thinking about
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.940]   the more powerful AI becomes.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.700]   So most of the employees at OpenAI
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.980]   will be thinking safety,
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.100]   or at least to some degree.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.780]   - Broadly defined, yes.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.660]   - Yeah.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.260]   I wonder what are the full broad definition of that?
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.660]   Like what are the different harms that could be caused?
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.660]   Is this like on a technical level,
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.860]   or is this almost like security threats?
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.580]   - It'll be all those things.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.380]   Yeah, I was gonna say,
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.460]   it'll be people, state actors trying to steal the model.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:53.900]   It'll be all of the technical alignment work.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.780]   It'll be societal impacts, economic impacts.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:02.300]   It's not just like we have one team
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.660]   thinking about how to align the model.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.660]   And it's really gonna be like,
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.300]   getting to the good outcome
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.980]   is gonna take the whole effort.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:14.060]   - How hard do you think people, state actors perhaps,
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.100]   are trying to hack?
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:18.220]   First of all, infiltrate OpenAI,
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.300]   but second of all, infiltrate unseen?
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.100]   - They're trying.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.380]   (Lex laughs)
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.060]   - What kind of accent do they have?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.180]   - I don't actually want any further details on this point.
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:29.680]   - Okay.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.540]   But I presume it'll be more and more and more
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:35.340]   as time goes on.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.380]   - That feels reasonable.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.580]   - Boy, what a dangerous space.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.980]   What aspect of the leap,
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.660]   and sorry to linger on this,
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:46.540]   even though you can't quite say details yet,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:49.580]   but what aspects of the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.340]   are you excited about?
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.220]   - I'm excited about being smarter.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.820]   And I know that sounds like a glib answer,
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.940]   but I think the really special thing happening
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:01.340]   is that it's not like it gets better in this one area
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.620]   and worse at others.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.180]   It's getting better across the board.
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.180]   That's, I think, super cool.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.100]   - Yeah, there's this magical moment.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.540]   I mean, you meet certain people,
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.020]   you hang out with people, and you talk to them.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.340]   You can't quite put a finger on it,
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:16.860]   but they kind of get you.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.380]   It's not intelligence, really.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:21.660]   It's something else.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:25.500]   And that's probably how I would characterize
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.860]   the progress of GPT.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.540]   It's not like, yeah, you can point out,
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.300]   look, it didn't get this or that.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.980]   But it's just to which degree
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.980]   is there's this intellectual connection?
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.740]   Like you feel like there's an understanding
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:41.820]   in your crappy formulated prompts that you're doing
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.020]   that it grasps the deeper question
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.220]   behind the question that you're...
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:48.620]   Yeah, I'm also excited by that.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:51.900]   I mean, all of us love being understood,
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:52.860]   heard and understood.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.660]   - That's for sure.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.540]   - That's a weird feeling.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.060]   Even like with the programming,
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.460]   like when you're programming and you say something
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:01.180]   or just the completion that GPT might do,
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:04.860]   it's just such a good feeling when it got you,
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:05.980]   like what you're thinking about.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.340]   And I look forward to getting you even better.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:13.900]   On the programming front, looking out into the future,
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.500]   how much programming do you think humans
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.260]   will be doing five, 10 years from now?
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.180]   - I mean, a lot, but I think it'll be
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:22.700]   in a very different shape.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.940]   Like maybe some people will program
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.220]   entirely in natural language.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.300]   - Entirely natural language.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:33.260]   - I mean, no one programs like writing bytecode.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:35.420]   Some people, no one programs the punch cards anymore.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.620]   I'm sure you can find someone who does.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:38.540]   But you know what I mean.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.940]   - Yeah, you're gonna get a lot of angry comments now.
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:43.020]   Yeah, there's very few.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.940]   I've been looking for people who program FORTRAN.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.620]   It's hard to find, even FORTRAN.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.300]   - I hear you.
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:51.260]   But that changes the nature of what the skill set
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.060]   or the predisposition for the kind of people
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.260]   we call programmers then.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.460]   - It changes the skill set.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.620]   How much it changes the predisposition, I'm not sure.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.700]   - Oh, same kind of puzzle solving?
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.020]   - Maybe.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:01.500]   - All that kind of stuff.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.580]   Programming is hard.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.380]   How get that last 1% to close the gap?
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.100]   How hard is that?
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.260]   - Yeah, I think with most other cases,
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.220]   the best practitioners of the craft will use multiple tools.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.460]   And they'll do some work in natural language.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.420]   And when they need to go write C for something,
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:19.980]   they'll do that.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.860]   - Will we see humanoid robots
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.940]   or humanoid robot brains from open AI at some point?
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.460]   - At some point.
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:31.660]   - How important is embodied AI to you?
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.620]   - I think it's sort of depressing if we have AGI
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:38.460]   and the only way to get things done in the physical world
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.380]   is to make a human go do it.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.580]   So I really hope that as part of this transition,
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.940]   as this phase change,
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:50.060]   we also get humanoid robots
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.500]   or some sort of physical world robots.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.100]   - I mean, open AI has some history,
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.420]   quite a bit of history working in robotics.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:55.740]   - Yeah.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.020]   - But it hasn't quite done in terms of emphasis--
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.060]   - We're like a small company.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:00.940]   We have to really focus.
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.460]   And also robots were hard for the wrong reason at the time.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:10.140]   But like, we will return to robots in some way at some point.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:13.420]   - That sounds both inspiring and menacing.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:14.540]   - Why?
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:17.580]   - Because immediately we will return to robots.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.740]   It's kind of like, and they could determine--
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.820]   - We will return to work on developing robots.
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.740]   We will not like turn ourselves into robots, of course.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:30.300]   When do you think we, you and we as humanity will build AGI?
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.340]   - I used to love to speculate on that question.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:37.180]   I have realized since that I think it's like very poorly formed
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:42.540]   and that people use extremely different definitions for what AGI is.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:48.700]   And so I think it makes more sense to talk about
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.900]   when we'll build systems that can do capability X or Y or Z,
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:57.260]   rather than when we kind of like fuzzily cross this one mile marker.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.500]   It's not like, like AGI is also not an ending.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.820]   It's much more of a, it's closer to a beginning,
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:04.300]   but it's much more of a mile marker than either of those things.
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:10.860]   But what I would say in the interest of not trying to dodge a question
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.380]   is I expect that by the end of this decade
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:21.180]   and possibly somewhat sooner than that,
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:25.180]   we will have quite capable systems that we look at and say,
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.700]   "Wow, that's really remarkable."
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.940]   If we could look at it now, you know,
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.540]   maybe we've adjusted by the time we get there.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:34.140]   - Yeah, but you know, if you look at Chad GPT,
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:38.620]   even with 3.5 and you show that to Alan Turing
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.900]   or not even Alan Turing, people in the '90s,
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.620]   they would be like, "This is definitely AGI."
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:47.740]   Well, not definitely, but there's a lot of experts
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:48.940]   that would say this is AGI.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.380]   - Yeah, but I don't think 3.5 changed the world.
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:56.620]   It maybe changed the world's expectations for the future
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.460]   and that's actually really important.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.580]   And it did kind of like get more people to take this seriously
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.940]   and put us on this new trajectory
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.460]   and that's really important too.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.020]   So again, I don't wanna undersell it.
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.980]   I think I could retire after that accomplishment
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.420]   and be pretty happy with my career,
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.100]   but as an artifact,
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:16.060]   I don't think we're gonna look back at that and say
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:20.140]   that was a threshold that really changed the world itself.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:23.420]   - So to you, you're looking for some really major transition
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.140]   in how the world--
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:26.300]   - For me, that's part of what AGI implies.
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.100]   - Like singularity level transition?
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:31.980]   - No, definitely not.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.380]   - But just a major, like the internet being,
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.460]   like Google search did, I guess.
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.020]   What was the transition point?
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:42.220]   - Like does the global economy feel any different to you now
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.580]   or materially different to you now
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.500]   than it did before we launched GPT-4?
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.780]   I think you would say no.
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:48.540]   - No, no.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.940]   It might be just a really nice tool
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.900]   for a lot of people to use.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.940]   It'll help you with a lot of stuff,
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:53.900]   but doesn't feel different.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:55.980]   And you're saying that, I mean, again,
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.900]   people define AGI all sorts of different ways,
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.580]   so maybe you have a different definition than I do,
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.900]   but for me, I think that should be part of it.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:04.780]   - There could be major theatrical moments also.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:10.860]   What to you would be an impressive thing AGI would do?
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.700]   Like you are alone in a room with a system.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:17.820]   - This is personally important to me.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.340]   I don't know if this is the right definition.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:24.540]   I think when a system can significantly increase
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.220]   the rate of scientific discovery in the world,
[01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.540]   that's like a huge deal.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.500]   I believe that most real economic growth
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.900]   comes from scientific and technological progress.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:35.980]   - I agree with you.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:40.780]   That's why I don't like the skepticism about science
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.660]   in the recent years.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:42.160]   - Totally.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:46.620]   - But actual rate, like measurable rate
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.740]   of scientific discovery.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.460]   But even just seeing a system
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:57.180]   have really novel intuitions, like scientific intuitions,
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:00.700]   even that would be just incredible.
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.200]   - Yeah.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.740]   - You quite possibly would be the person
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.740]   to build the AGI to be able to interact with it
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:06.700]   before anyone else does.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.780]   What kind of stuff would you talk about?
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.780]   - I mean, definitely the researchers here
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.060]   will do that before I do.
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:12.780]   - Sure.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.660]   - But what will I, I've actually thought a lot
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.380]   about this question.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.420]   If I were, someone was like, I think this is,
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:21.580]   as we talked earlier, I think this is a bad framework.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:25.020]   But if someone were like, okay, Sam, we're finished.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:26.220]   Here's a laptop.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.260]   This is the AGI.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.260]   You know, you can go talk to it.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:37.340]   I find it surprisingly difficult to say what I would ask,
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.820]   that I would expect that first AGI to be able to answer.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:44.300]   Like that first one is not gonna be the one which is like,
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:49.100]   go like, you know, I don't think, like go explain to me
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.420]   like the grand unified theory of physics,
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.620]   the theory of everything for physics.
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.740]   I'd love to ask that question.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.100]   I'd love to know the answer to that question.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.940]   - You can ask yes or no questions about,
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.420]   does such a theory exist?
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.060]   Can it exist?
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.900]   - Well, then those are the first questions I would ask.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:05.180]   - Yes or no, just very, and then based on that,
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.100]   are there other alien civilizations out there?
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:07.820]   Yes or no?
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.020]   What's your intuition?
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.140]   And then you just ask that.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.980]   - Yeah, I mean, well, so I don't expect
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.700]   that this first AGI could answer any of those questions,
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.820]   even as yes or no.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.340]   But those would, if it could,
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:18.540]   those would be very high on my list.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.820]   - Maybe you're gonna start assigning probabilities.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.340]   - Maybe, maybe we need to go invent more technology
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.380]   and measure more things first.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.660]   - But if it's an AGI, oh, I see.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:30.940]   It just doesn't have enough data.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.860]   - I mean, maybe it says like, you know,
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:35.420]   you wanna know the answer to this question about physics.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.780]   I need you to like build this machine
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:39.020]   and make these five measurements and tell me that.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.820]   - Yeah, like what the hell do you want from me?
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.100]   I need the machine first
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.740]   and I'll help you deal with the data from that machine.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:46.940]   Maybe it'll help you build the machine.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.580]   - Maybe, maybe.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:51.580]   - And on the mathematical side, maybe prove some things.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.300]   Are you interested in that side of things too?
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.380]   The formalized exploration of ideas?
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:02.540]   Whoever builds AGI first gets a lot of power.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:06.700]   Do you trust yourself with that much power?
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:19.300]   Look, I was gonna, I'll just be very honest with this answer.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:20.900]   I was gonna say, and I still believe this,
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:26.020]   that it is important that I, nor any other one person,
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:31.300]   have total control over OpenAI or over AGI.
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:36.260]   And I think you want a robust governance system.
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:41.220]   I can point out a whole bunch of things
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.180]   about all of our board drama from last year
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:48.420]   about how I didn't fight it initially
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.820]   and was just like, yeah, that's the will of the board,
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:52.340]   even though I think it's a really bad decision.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:57.380]   And then later I clearly did fight it
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.580]   and I can explain the nuance
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:01.380]   and why I think it was okay for me to fight it later.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:04.900]   But as many people have observed,
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:12.340]   although the board had the legal ability to fire me,
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:15.140]   in practice, it didn't quite work.
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:23.220]   And that is its own kind of governance failure.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:27.220]   Now, again, I feel like I can completely defend
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.140]   the specifics here.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:32.660]   And I think most people would agree with that,
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:40.420]   but it does make it harder for me
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.620]   to look you in the eye and say,
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.740]   "Hey, the board can just fire me."
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:51.140]   I continue to not want super-voting control over OpenAI.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.980]   I never have, never had it, never wanted it.
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:56.820]   Even after all this craziness, I still don't want it.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.300]   I continue to think that no company
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.060]   should be making these decisions
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:08.660]   and that we really need governments
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.860]   to put rules of the road in place.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.180]   And I realize that that means people
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.940]   like Marc Andreessen or whatever
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.100]   will claim I'm going for regulatory capture
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:20.020]   and I'm just willing to be misunderstood there.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.300]   It's not true.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.220]   And I think in the fullness of time,
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.900]   it'll get proven out why this is important.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:35.060]   But I think I have made plenty of bad decisions
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.660]   for OpenAI along the way, and a lot of good ones.
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:41.700]   And I am proud of the track record overall,
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.020]   but I don't think any one person should,
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:45.620]   and I don't think any one person will.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.980]   I think it's just too big of a thing
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.500]   now that it's happening throughout society
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.260]   in a good and healthy way.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.140]   I don't think any one person should be in control of an AGI,
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.740]   or this whole movement towards AGI.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.420]   And I don't think that's what's happening.
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.900]   - Thank you for saying that.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.140]   That was really powerful and that was really insightful
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.980]   that this idea that the board can fire you is legally true.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.780]   But you can,
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:14.660]   and human beings can manipulate the masses
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:19.300]   into overriding the board and so on.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.420]   But I think there's also a much more positive version of that
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.860]   where the people still have power.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.980]   So the board can't be too powerful either.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.380]   There's a balance of power in all of this.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:30.980]   - Balance of power is a good thing for sure.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:37.140]   - Are you afraid of losing control of the AGI itself?
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:40.660]   That's a lot of people who worried about existential risk,
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:41.860]   not because of state actors,
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.460]   not because of security concerns,
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:44.740]   because of the AI itself.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.420]   - That is not my top worry.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.460]   As I currently see things,
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:48.820]   there have been times I worried about that more
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:50.260]   than maybe times, again, in the future,
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.180]   that's my top worry.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.300]   It's not my top worry right now.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.300]   - What's your intuition about it not being your worry?
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.420]   'Cause there's a lot of other stuff
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.380]   to worry about essentially.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:01.540]   You think you could be surprised?
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.180]   We could be surprised.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.140]   - For sure, of course.
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:06.660]   Saying it's not my top worry doesn't mean
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.460]   I think we need to work on it super hard.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.180]   And we have great people here who do work on that.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.340]   I think there's a lot of other things
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:15.380]   we also have to get right.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.980]   - To you, it's not super easy to escape the box at this time.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.900]   Like connect to the internet.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:24.420]   - We talked about theatrical risks earlier.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.540]   That's a theatrical risk.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:29.460]   That is a thing that can really take over
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:31.220]   how people think about this problem.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:34.500]   And there's a big group of very smart,
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.620]   I think very well-meaning AI safety researchers
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:41.300]   that got super hung up on this one problem.
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:42.580]   I'd argue without much progress,
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:44.020]   but super hung up on this one problem.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.900]   I'm actually happy that they do that
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.020]   because I think we do need to think about this more.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.900]   But I think it pushed aside,
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.740]   it pushed out of the space of discourse
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:43:00.900]   a lot of the other very significant AI-related risks.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.820]   - Let me ask you about you tweeting with no capitalization.
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:06.980]   Is the shift key broken on your keyboard?
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.140]   - Why does anyone care about that?
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:10.420]   - I deeply care.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:11.060]   - But why?
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.460]   I mean, other people are asking about that too.
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:13.940]   - Yeah.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:15.860]   - Any intuition?
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.020]   - I think it's the same reason.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.020]   There's like this poet, E.E. Cummings,
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:23.300]   that mostly doesn't use capitalization
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.020]   to say like, "Fuck you to the system," kind of thing.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.780]   And I think people are very paranoid
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:28.900]   'cause they want you to follow the rules.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:29.860]   - You think that's what it's about?
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.740]   - I think it's--
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.700]   - It's like this guy doesn't follow the rules.
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.060]   He doesn't capitalize his tweets.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:35.540]   - Yeah.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.740]   - This seems really dangerous.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.580]   - He seems like an anarchist.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:39.700]   - It doesn't--
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:42.580]   - Are you just being poetic, hipster?
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:43.300]   What's the--
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.340]   - I grew up--
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.380]   - Follow the rules, Sam.
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.140]   - I grew up as a very online kid.
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.660]   I'd spent a huge amount of time
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.620]   chatting with people back in the days
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.900]   where you did it on a computer
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:55.460]   and you could log off Instant Messenger at some point.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.620]   And I never capitalized there
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.740]   as I think most internet kids didn't,
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.740]   or maybe they still don't, I don't know.
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:09.780]   And actually, this is like,
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.780]   now I'm really trying to reach for something,
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.380]   but I think capitalization has gone down over time.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.900]   If you read old English writing,
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.580]   they capitalized a lot of random words
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.100]   in the middle of sentences, nouns, and stuff
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:21.220]   that we just don't do anymore.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:26.100]   I personally think it's sort of like a dumb construct
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.380]   that we capitalize the letter
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:28.260]   at the beginning of a sentence
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.340]   and of certain names and whatever,
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.940]   but I don't, that's fine.
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:37.780]   And I used to, I think, even capitalize my tweets
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.780]   'cause I was trying to sound professional or something.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.700]   I haven't capitalized my private DMs
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.900]   or whatever in a long time.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:53.620]   And then slowly, stuff like shorter form,
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:57.140]   less formal stuff has slowly drifted
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.740]   to closer and closer to how I would text my friends.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:04.100]   If I pull up a Word document
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.620]   and I'm writing a strategy memo
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.580]   for the company or something,
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.620]   I always capitalize that.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:11.540]   If I'm writing a long, more formal message,
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.820]   I always use capitalization there too.
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:14.820]   So I still remember how to do it,
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.740]   but even that may fade out, I don't know.
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:21.380]   But I never spend time thinking about this,
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.740]   so I don't have a ready-made.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.500]   - Well, it's interesting.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.380]   Well, it's good to, first of all,
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:26.740]   know the shift key is not broken.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:26.980]   - It works.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:29.220]   - I was just mostly concerned about your well-being
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:29.780]   on that front.
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:31.700]   - I wonder if people still capitalize
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:32.740]   their Google searches.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.500]   If you're writing something just to yourself
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:35.700]   or their ChatGBT queries,
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.140]   if you're writing something just to yourself,
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:40.420]   do some people still bother to capitalize?
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.300]   - Probably not.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.100]   Yeah, there's a percentage, but it's a small one.
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.140]   - The thing that would make me do it
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:45.940]   is if people were like,
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.660]   it's a sign of,
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.860]   'cause I'm sure I could force myself
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.380]   to use capital letters, obviously.
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:56.500]   If it felt like a sign of respect to people or something,
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.620]   then I could go do it.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:00.580]   But I don't know, I just don't think about this.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:02.100]   - I don't think there's a disrespect,
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.660]   but I think it's just the conventions of civility
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:08.580]   that have a momentum,
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.660]   and then you realize it's not actually important
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:13.140]   for civility if it's not a sign of respect or disrespect.
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.300]   But I think there's a movement of people
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:17.460]   that just want you to have a philosophy around it
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.540]   so they can let go of this whole capitalization thing.
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:21.460]   - I don't think anybody else thinks about this as much.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.340]   I mean, maybe some people.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.220]   - I think about this every day for many hours a day.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.860]   So I'm really grateful we clarified it.
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:29.860]   - Can't be the only person that doesn't capitalize tweets.
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:32.580]   - You're the only CEO of a company
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:33.780]   that doesn't capitalize tweets.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:35.700]   - I don't even think that's true, but maybe, maybe.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:37.780]   - All right, we'll investigate further
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:39.940]   and return to this topic later.
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:43.780]   Given Thor's ability to generate simulated worlds,
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.300]   let me ask you a pothead question.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:50.340]   Does this increase your belief,
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:52.740]   if you ever had one, that we live in a simulation?
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.620]   Maybe a simulated world generated by an AI system?
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:04.420]   - Yes, somewhat.
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.940]   I don't think that's the strongest piece of evidence.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:18.260]   I think the fact that we can generate worlds
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:22.740]   should increase everyone's probability somewhat,
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:25.220]   or at least openness to it somewhat.
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.060]   But I was certain we would be able
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.500]   to do something like Sora at some point.
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.860]   It happened faster than I thought.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.300]   But I guess that was not a big update.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:35.380]   - Yeah, but the fact that,
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.220]   and presumably it'll get better and better and better,
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.180]   the fact that you can generate worlds, they're novel.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:44.260]   They're based in some aspect of training data,
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:47.300]   but when you look at them, they're novel.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:52.500]   That makes you think, how easy it is to do this thing?
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.940]   How easy is it to create universes?
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:58.260]   Entire video game worlds that seem ultra-realistic
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.140]   and photo-realistic, and then how easy is it
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.340]   to get lost in that world?
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.420]   First with a VR headset,
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:06.820]   and then on the physics-based level.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:11.060]   - Someone said to me recently,
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.660]   I thought it was a super profound insight,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:22.100]   that there are these very simple sounding,
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:26.740]   but very psychedelic insights that exist sometimes.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.060]   So the square root function.
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:32.500]   Square root of four, no problem.
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:35.380]   Square root of two, okay,
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:37.380]   now I have to think about this new kind of number.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:45.540]   But once I come up with this easy idea
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:49.540]   of a square root function that you can explain to a child
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:54.180]   and exists by even looking at some simple geometry,
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.260]   then you can ask the question
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.860]   of what is the square root of negative one?
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:02.900]   And that, this is why it's a psychedelic thing,
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.700]   that tips you into some whole other kind of reality.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:11.220]   And you can come up with lots of other examples,
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:15.860]   but I think this idea that the lowly square root operator
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.820]   can offer such a profound insight
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:25.540]   and a new realm of knowledge applies in a lot of ways.
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:28.900]   And I think there are a lot of those operators
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:34.500]   for why people may think that any version that they like
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:35.860]   of the simulation hypothesis
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.780]   is maybe more likely than they thought before.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:43.940]   But for me, the fact that Sora worked
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.980]   is not in the top five.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:47.860]   - I do think broadly speaking,
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.100]   AI will serve as those kinds of gateways at its best.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.300]   Simple, psychedelic-like gateways
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.220]   to another way of seeing reality.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.580]   - That seems for certain.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.660]   - That's pretty exciting.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:04.180]   I haven't done ayahuasca before, but I will soon.
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.580]   I'm going to the aforementioned Amazon jungle
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:07.220]   in a few weeks.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:07.780]   - Excited?
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.460]   - Yeah, I'm excited for it.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.460]   Not the ayahuasca part, but that's great, whatever.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:14.180]   But I'm gonna spend several weeks in the jungle,
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:14.980]   deep in the jungle.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.780]   And it's exciting, but it's terrifying
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:19.860]   because there's a lot of things that can eat you there
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.540]   and kill you and poison you.
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:25.220]   But it's also nature and it's the machine of nature.
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:28.020]   And you can't help but appreciate the machinery of nature
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:29.060]   in the Amazon jungle
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:33.620]   'cause it's just like this system that just exists
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:37.220]   and renews itself every second, every minute, every hour.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.820]   It's the machine.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:42.500]   It makes you appreciate this thing we have here,
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.500]   this human thing came from somewhere.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.900]   This evolutionary machine has created that.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.860]   And it's most clearly on display in the jungle.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:53.620]   So hopefully I'll make it out alive.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.860]   If not, this will be the last conversation we had,
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.380]   so I really deeply appreciate it.
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:59.780]   Do you think, as I mentioned before,
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:02.100]   there's other alien civilizations out there,
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:05.220]   intelligent ones, when you look up at the skies?
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:19.700]   - I deeply wanna believe that the answer is yes.
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.020]   I do find the kind of where,
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:26.260]   I find the Fermi paradox very puzzling.
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:31.460]   - I find it scary that intelligence
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:35.620]   is not good at handling powerful technologies.
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:39.380]   But at the same time, I think I'm pretty confident
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:41.860]   that there's just a very large number
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.180]   of intelligent alien civilizations out there.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.420]   It might just be really difficult to travel through space.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:47.700]   - Very possible.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:50.980]   - And it also makes me think
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.180]   about the nature of intelligence.
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:56.100]   Maybe we're really blind to what intelligence looks like.
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.780]   And maybe AI will help us see that.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:01.140]   That it's not as simple as IQ tests
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.340]   and simple puzzle solving.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.380]   There's something bigger.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:08.900]   What gives you hope about the future of humanity?
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:12.020]   This thing we've got going on, this human civilization?
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.900]   - I think the past is like a lot.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.060]   I mean, we just look at what humanity has done
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:19.220]   in a not very long period of time.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.340]   You know, huge problems, deep flaws,
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.180]   lots to be super ashamed of.
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:28.500]   But on the whole, very inspiring.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.220]   Gives me a lot of hope.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.980]   - Just the trajectory of it all.
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:31.300]   - Yeah.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.940]   - That we're together pushing towards a better future.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:42.660]   - It is, you know, one thing that I wonder about
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:46.340]   is, is AGI gonna be more like some single brain?
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.900]   Or is it more like the sort of scaffolding
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:50.340]   in society between all of us?
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:55.700]   You have not had a great deal of genetic drift
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.700]   from your great, great, great grandparents.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:00.980]   And yet what you're capable of is dramatically different.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:03.380]   What you know is dramatically different.
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:07.620]   And that's not because of biological change.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.380]   It is because, I mean, you got a little bit healthier,
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:10.500]   probably, you have modern medicine,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.780]   you eat better, whatever.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:19.380]   But what you have is this scaffolding
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.700]   that we all contributed to, built on top of.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.820]   No one person is gonna go build the iPhone.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:27.300]   No one person is gonna go discover all of science.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.060]   And yet you get to use it.
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.820]   And that gives you incredible ability.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:35.700]   And so in some sense, the like, we all created that.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.300]   And that fills me with hope for the future.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.380]   That was a very collective thing.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.420]   - Yeah, we really are standing on the shoulders of giants.
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.860]   You mentioned when we were talking about theatrical,
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:53.940]   dramatic AI risks, that sometimes you might
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.060]   be afraid for your own life.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:57.220]   Do you think about your death?
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:57.940]   Are you afraid of it?
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.940]   - I mean, I like, if I got shot tomorrow
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:02.980]   and I knew it today, I'd be like, oh, that's sad.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.940]   I like, don't, you know, I wanna see what's gonna happen.
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:06.900]   - Yeah.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.900]   - What a curious time.
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.860]   What an interesting time.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:14.180]   But I would mostly just feel like very grateful for my life.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.340]   - The moments that you did get.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:19.140]   Yeah, me too.
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:21.380]   It's a pretty awesome life.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:25.460]   I get to enjoy awesome creations of humans,
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:29.380]   of which I believe Chad GPT is one of,
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.860]   and everything that OpenAI is doing.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.380]   Sam, it's really an honor and pleasure to talk to you again.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.580]   - Great to talk to you.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:37.300]   Thank you for having me.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.980]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Altman.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.260]   To support this podcast,

[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.260]   And now let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:51.700]   It may be that our role on this planet
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.700]   is not to worship God, but to create him.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:00.900]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.200]   you
