[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   That brings us to a consideration of the doctrine of the Second Coming of our Lord and Saviour
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.720]   Jesus Christ. Now we begin the consideration of this last Friday evening, and that was
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.880]   very largely introductory. I mean by that that we spent most of our time with definitions.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.080]   We considered the four main terms that are used, the term apocalypse, the term epiphany,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:43.000]   the parousia, the presence, and various other terms which are used, the day, that day, the
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.760]   great day, the day of judgment, and so on. And we also went on to lay down certain things
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.240]   which are very clearly and obviously taught in the Scripture about the manner of our Lord's
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   second appearing. We emphasize that it is going to be personal, not a mere influence,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.760]   but he will appear in person. It will be physical also, not spiritual. It will therefore be
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.560]   visible. He shall be seen in the clouds of the heavens. It will be sudden, and it will
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.440]   be glorious. And in addition to laying down those points, those truths, I spent a good
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:38.680]   deal of time in emphasizing the all-importance of our approach to this subject, and indicated
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   that nothing perhaps which we ever have to consider as Christian people insists upon
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.600]   such a careful observance of our spirits as this particular subject, involved as it is
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.900]   in many difficult and abstruse points, and subject as it has been always to such controversy
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.000]   and debate and discussion.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now, having said that, we can proceed this evening to the next aspect of this doctrine
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.840]   which must of necessity be considered, namely, the time of his coming. When is our Lord going
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.320]   to appear? Now, if I have emphasized already the importance of care, and the importance
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   of watching our spirits, and the danger of being gripped by prejudices, if I have done
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.120]   that in general, how much more necessary is it with respect to this particular aspect
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.640]   of the subject? Because so much of the interest in our Lord's second coming centers upon
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   this one question of the time. People are very concerned about this. When is our Lord
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.840]   going to appear? Is it imminent? May it happen at any moment? And there is no doubt at all
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.160]   that it is because of that kind of interest that this subject always makes its appeal
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.240]   to Christian people. I think I've got evidence of that in front of me at this present moment.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.560]   I'm quite aware of the fact that always these questions of prophecy, especially when you
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.480]   come to certain details, do in that way make their appeal. I remember very well on one
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.280]   occasion when Dr. Campbell Morgan was still here with us. He was giving a series of lectures,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   and in the vestry before a meeting one night he said to me, "Keep your eye on the increase
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.560]   in the congregation tonight." I said, "Why?" Well, he said, "I'm announced to speak on
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.200]   a prophetic subject." And he said, "I never deal with the question of prophecy, but that
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   there's always a marked increase in the size of the congregation." Well, we may have our
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.960]   own thoughts and ideas as to the cause of the increase, but that it is a fact, I think,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   is quite clear and obvious. But it's there, I say, we have to be very careful lest we
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:28.400]   be led by the adversary of our souls into something that is quite false. Let me therefore
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:38.240]   repeat this statement. The test of your interest in this question is this. Is the effect of
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.760]   your study of it or of your consideration of it upon your daily life and living? I think
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.800]   I established last Friday that whenever this doctrine is introduced in the Scripture, it
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:03.120]   is always in that context. It is always as a part of the appeal to holiness. So, if your
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.440]   interest in this subject is simply that you may know times and dates and may be able to
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.680]   speak with authority as to when certain things are going to happen, well, then I say you
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:21.040]   are just unscriptural. You've got a wrong interest, a false one, an unhealthy one. Our
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.800]   interest in the second coming of our Lord should always be in terms of our relationship
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.400]   to him, and unless it has the effect upon us of striving to be holy and to be ready
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.280]   for that great day, well, then there has been something wrong in the way we've been approaching
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:48.560]   it. Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. And unless you
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.040]   go away from here tonight with this desire to be purified and determined to purify yourselves,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.240]   well, either I shall have failed very badly in what I say from this pulpit, or else you
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.800]   will not have been listening to what I am saying. That is the context, and we must never
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.760]   forget it, so that we must examine our motives. We must also bear in mind the history of the
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   past. And there we find how men, saintly men, men of God and men whom God used and honored,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.960]   were led astray with respect to this particular matter. And when I say led astray, it is not
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.680]   a matter of opinion, because some of them actually committed themselves to precise dates,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.640]   which have long since passed, and therefore they were clearly and patently wrong. Well,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.320]   I say let us take great warning, therefore, from the past, and let us approach this whole
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.640]   subject with one great desire, namely, that we may know him better, and that we may serve
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.960]   him more truly, and that we may honestly try to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.440]   Now it is rather astounding, it seems to me, that people should ever go astray on this
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.520]   matter, because there are at least two statements in the Scripture that should have saved us
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.720]   from it. Take the statement in 1 Thessalonians 5, in the first verse, "But of the times
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you." And he goes on to point
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.080]   out how he will come as a thief in the night, and so on. But there is a still more important
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.880]   statement, and I do want to emphasize this. Listen to these words of our blessed Lord
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:47.360]   and Saviour himself. You will find them in Mark 13, verse 32. "But of that day and
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:57.480]   that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven," listen, "neither
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:07.760]   the Son, but the Father." There is the Son of God himself telling us that he did not
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.240]   know the time, the date, and the hour. He says that this is a knowledge which was denied
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   him as the Son of Man, that the angels in heaven do not know it, that it is a day and
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:29.360]   a time which is known only to the Father. And yet, look at the books which bear eloquent
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.520]   testimony to the fact that Christian people have nevertheless been trying to fix it exactly,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.320]   in spite of those two verses, without abusing any other verses.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:49.280]   Well, obviously, therefore, I am not this evening going to give you any help or indication
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:59.760]   whatsoever in a precise form as to when this is going to take place. Indeed, my whole endeavor
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.420]   as we consider this great subject is simply to concentrate on those things about which
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:13.520]   we can be absolutely certain. There are certain things about which we can be certain. I have
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.480]   already mentioned the manner in which it is going to come. There is no question about
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.160]   that. It seems to me that Scripture is perfectly plain and explicit. We will hold on to those
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.560]   things. As for the rest, all I am going to endeavor to do is to put various views before
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:42.480]   you and ask you to consider them and to weigh them in the light of the scriptural evidence.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:50.960]   Indeed, I shall be very pleased if some of you go away from the end of this series of
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:59.000]   discourses feeling less certain than you were at the beginning. I shall be most grateful,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.200]   I shall be very thankful, I shall feel that I have achieved my object. Because if there
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   is one subject about which dogmatism should be entirely excluded, it is this. We are in
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:20.480]   a realm where we cannot be dogmatic. Therefore, our business is, I say, to consider various
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   possible views and interpretations and ask God to lead us and to guide us. I am going
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:35.720]   to say something that may shock some of you, and yet I feel constrained to say it. Beware
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:47.240]   of the terrible danger of being led from the main line of Christian living by an inordinate
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:54.960]   interest in the details of this great doctrine. It has happened to many. I have known large
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.280]   numbers of Christian people whose spiritual life has become dry and barren simply because
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.660]   this became almost an obsession. They were always reading about it, the latest books
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.160]   about it, comparing them, arguing it out, working things out. They gave themselves to
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.960]   that and their spiritual lives became dry and barren. They forgot even their practical
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   work as Christians. They became students of prophecy, and it led them onto a side track.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.480]   I have known many in that position for many years.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.840]   Do let us try to preserve the balance of Scripture. Let us give to this doctrine the place that
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.560]   it has in the Scripture itself and not exaggerate it. It is one of those subjects which easily
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.320]   tends to exaggerate itself in our minds unless we are extremely careful. I therefore repeat
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:55.040]   these warnings again. Far from being able to give you any date, I am concerned mainly
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.880]   to discourage anybody to be concerned about dates and times and seasons. We should be
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.640]   interested rather in these great general principles which help us to understand the thrust of
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.400]   the scriptural teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:17.800]   As we approach this question of the time of his coming, there are certain points which
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.320]   we must take up. Here is one, for instance. Did the apostles believe that it was going
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.600]   to happen in their own day and generation? That is a question that is often raised. There
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.920]   have been critics of the Scriptures who have said to us that they cannot accept the Scriptures
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.800]   as the Word of God because they say it is perfectly clear that those apostles, the very
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.880]   writers, believed that the Lord was coming in their own day and generation, and they
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.520]   were patently and obviously wrong. So they make use of that to make an attack upon the
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.560]   authority of the Scripture in general.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.000]   But now, what do the Scriptures really say about this?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.840]   Well, I suggest to you that they say this. The apostles in their questions to our Lord
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.160]   most certainly did give the impression often that they thought it was going to happen in
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   their day and generation. But I defy you to give me a single statement where they ever
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.640]   taught it in writing. Now, then, that is a dogmatic statement, and I suggest to you that
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.160]   if you examine the Scriptures you will find it is correct. They seemed to believe it in
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:36.400]   their questions, but they never taught it as such. But there are certain statements
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.040]   and certain passages which on the surface and at first reading might give the impression
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.400]   that they did teach that.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.600]   Now then, what do we do with them? Well, there are certain principles which we have to bear
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.960]   in mind in that connection. Here is the first. We must remember that when a statement is
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:06.120]   made from God's side, that we must always remember that with God a thousand years are
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:15.040]   as one day and one day as a thousand years. The whole category, the term "time," when
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:22.520]   it is thought of from the Godward side, must always carry with it this idea, as I say,
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.880]   a thousand years as one day and one day as a thousand years. Don't take our ideas of
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.720]   time and import it into such a statement. That's one principle.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.880]   Then another important principle is this, that as the term "the last times" or "the
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:49.440]   last days" is used in the Scripture in the New Testament, we must remember that it generally
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.400]   refers to the whole of the New Testament era, starting with the coming of our Lord and going
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.880]   on until the second appearing of our Lord. The time in which you and I live is a part
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:09.400]   of the last days or the last time as the term is used in the New Testament. Therefore, if
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.680]   that is so, it is very wrong to confine the term "the last times" or "the last days"
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:21.400]   to something that is yet going to happen. You and I are already in the last times. The
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.840]   Christians of a thousand years ago were. The first Christians were. The last times began
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.920]   at the first advent and will run on until the second advent. That's a very important
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.920]   point and very important to bear in mind as we read our New Testament.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:45.040]   Then a third principle and the last one I mention is this. There is what is called and
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:56.120]   rightly called prophetic foreshortening. Now, that means just this. As you read your prophecies
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.780]   in the Old Testament, you will notice that the prophet at one and the same time is talking
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:09.240]   about the first coming of the Lord and the second coming. You have to be very careful
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.600]   that you make sure which he is referring to. The two seem to be blended in together. The
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.480]   whole period of the church in which you and I are living is not there very obviously.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.400]   It is there, but it is not there obviously. The prophet seems to speak of the first and
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.840]   second coming in the same breath, as it were. That is prophetic foreshortening. Now, you
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:41.280]   get exactly the same thing in the New Testament. You get references to the destruction of Jerusalem
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:52.040]   in A.D. 70, and references to the Day of Judgment, the end of the world, more or less telescoped
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.400]   into one another. You have to be very careful as you read certain chapters like Matthew
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:07.480]   24, Mark 13, or Luke 21, that you bear that principle in mind.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:14.480]   Now, let us spend just a moment with this because it is so important. Take those chapters,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   Matthew 24 and 25, Mark 13 and Luke 21. The question is, what is our Lord dealing with
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:32.880]   in the discourses that are recorded in those chapters? Well, there are mainly three. The
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.760]   first is this. When was the temple and the city of Jerusalem to be destroyed? You remember
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.520]   the disciples asked him that very question. He told them about the coming destruction
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.760]   of the temple, and they asked him, "When is this going to happen?" So, he does answer
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:56.360]   that question. He also deals with the second subject, which is, what are to be the signs
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   of his coming? That is certainly dealt with. What are the signs of his coming? But in addition
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:14.000]   to that, he clearly goes on to deal also with the end of the age, the last and the final
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   judgment.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.960]   Now, when people have come to read Matthew 24, 25, Mark 13, and Luke 21, you will generally
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:33.080]   find that there have been three main schools of thought. The commentators and the expositors,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.520]   these saintly, godly men who have lived in the church before us throughout the centuries,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.600]   they have studied these scriptures as he went on, and their results can be summarized under
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:54.440]   three main categories. There have been those who say that in those chapters, our Lord deals
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.920]   with nothing but the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and the spread of the gospel. You
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.200]   would be astonished if you knew some of the great names that can be attached to that interpretation.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:12.160]   They have said, "There, our Lord was dealing with one thing only, the destruction of the
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.920]   temple, the destruction of the city, and the subsequent spread of the Christian gospel.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.140]   It was that, and it was nothing but that."
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.280]   But there is a second school which teaches this. Yes, they say, he certainly did deal
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:36.560]   with that. And in a sense, he was mainly concerned with it, but he did not stop at that. He made
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:45.800]   use of that to say this, that what was going to happen in A.D. 70 was also a picture of
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   what was going to happen on a much bigger scale at the end of the age and on the Day
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.960]   of Judgment. In other words, that what was going to happen in A.D. 70 was going to be
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:04.320]   a fact. Yes, but not only a fact, more than that, a prophecy, a picture, a parable of
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.760]   the yet greater and bigger thing that is going to happen when the age is summed up and the
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.680]   end has come and the final judgment is pronounced. That is the second school. They say it is
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.860]   not only A.D. 70, it is A.D. 70 plus that.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.920]   But then there is a third school. And if you were to press me to say as to which of the
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   three I belong to, I should say this third one. It is this, which holds that in those
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:39.400]   chapters our Lord was deliberately dealing with the two things that certain of his statements
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:45.520]   have referenced to A.D. 70 only, and that other statements have referenced to the end
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:53.280]   of the age and the Day of Judgment only. So that it was not A.D. 70 itself plus a picture
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.440]   of the end. No, no, A.D. 70 in particular, the end of the age in particular.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.720]   Now I commend to you a study again of those chapters in the light of that principle. And
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   I think you will find that certain of the statements—I obviously have not got the
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.840]   time to go into this in detail, perhaps I should not be doing as much as I am in considering
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:22.920]   biblical doctrines—I am doing it deliberately in order that we may become aware of the difficulties
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.360]   and see that nothing is so wrong as to jump to conclusions. Go through it, I say, and
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.120]   keep your eye on it, and observe the way in which he is dealing with Jerusalem only, and
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:42.560]   then with something much bigger, the end of the world and the end of the age.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:53.840]   Very well. There are certain points with regard to that question as to whether the apostles
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.000]   thought that this was going to happen in their own day and generation. Often the confusion
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.080]   arises because people interpret in terms of the end what our Lord was using simply with
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:14.920]   respect to A.D. 70, and so on. But now let me come to a second question. May our Lord
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:24.320]   come again now at any time? Or can we say that certain things are going to happen before
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.640]   he comes? Well, now here again I feel the teaching of the Scripture is very definite
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:38.480]   and perfectly explicit. There are certain signs which will precede his coming. What
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:45.960]   are they? Well, here is the first. The calling of the Gentiles. Now you have got that in
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.040]   Matthew, the Gospel according to St. Matthew, the twenty-fourth chapter and the fourteenth
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   verse, a very famous and a most important verse. Let me read it to you. Matthew 24,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:06.480]   14. "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   unto all nations, and then shall the end come." That is perfectly clear, isn't it? And there
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:21.800]   is indeed no doubt about that at all. You have got a similar statement in Mark 13, 10,
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.600]   and you have got it as we saw in that great eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.520]   in the twenty-fifth verse, the fullness of the Gentiles. Now those things are certainly
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:42.240]   going to take place before our Lord will come, before he will appear again. The calling of
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   the Gentiles. Yes, but having said that, let me come on to something which is really difficult
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:24:01.280]   and yet taught quite clearly. A second sign is going to be the gathering in of the fullness
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:08.560]   of Israel. You noticed that, didn't you, in the reading again at the beginning in that
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:18.200]   great chapter. Clearly teaching that the Jews are certainly going to be gathered into the
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:27.000]   kingdom and that that is going to happen before the end. You have got a similar statement
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.640]   in the second epistle to the Corinthians in the third chapter in verses 15 and 16. At
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.600]   least this is the evidence that is generally brought forward. Let me read them to you.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.240]   "But even to this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.920]   as it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away." That is generally quoted
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:57.480]   also in this connection. But of course, the classical passage is this great statement
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:08.840]   in Romans 11, especially from verse 25 to verse 29. This is one of the most controversial
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:17.360]   aspects of this entire doctrine. Now, what does it teach? Well, as you know, the popular
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:27.740]   doctrine is this, that there is to be a national restoration and conversion of the children
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:37.080]   of Israel. The Jewish nation, we are told, shall be taken back to the promised land,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   and there there will take place a great conversion of the nation. And this nation of the Jews
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:52.000]   will then become the greatest evangelists that the world has ever known. That is the
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.240]   teaching in its essence. There are subdivisions, there are different schools even there. Some
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:03.160]   say that this will precede the millennium; others say that it will take place during
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:10.080]   the millennium. But in general, that is their position. Now, what evidence is there for
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:19.160]   that? What is it in the Scripture that seems to teach that there is to be a national conversion
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:26.360]   of the Jews? Well, here are the Scriptures that are generally put forward. In Matthew
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:33.920]   19, verse 28, you read these words, "Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.560]   me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall come, shall sit in the throne of his
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:48.080]   glory; ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." That
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.880]   is one. "In the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of his glory,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.320]   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." But then there
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:09.120]   are other statements, and here are others. Luke 21, verse 24, "And they shall fall by
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:16.960]   the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:26.480]   be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Now,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:33.000]   there are the important Scriptures that are put forward in connection also with this statement
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.680]   in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans. And of course, recently, such
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.440]   friends who believe in it have pointed out to the fact that it is a historic fact that
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.320]   the Jews have persisted as a nation and as a race in spite of terrible persecutions,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:57.440]   and that of course is a fact. Then, of course, came the important events in 1917, when Jerusalem
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.720]   was recaptured from the hands of the Gentiles. You had your Balfour Declaration, and you
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:09.800]   have the setting up of the state and the nation of Israel, and the return of so many Jews
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   to the promised land. Now, there in its essence is the case as put forward for this belief
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.760]   that there is to be a national restoration and conversion of the Jews. But let me put
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:32.640]   certain evidence against that to your consideration. Take the statement, for instance, in Matthew
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:39.760]   8, 11, where we read, "Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:47.360]   down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.480]   kingdom shall be thrust out." Then, of course, you have very important statements in the
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:02.200]   gospel according to Matthew chapter 21, and these are of very great significance. You
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:11.400]   have got, for instance, the parable of the two sons, verses 28 to 32. And there is no
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:18.120]   doubt at all that that is a parable that refers to this matter. To the son who said he would
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.240]   go and didn't go, and to the son who said, "I go not," but afterwards repented and
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:30.040]   went. That, therefore, is very important. And then it's followed by one of the most
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.920]   important and significant statements which even our blessed Lord himself ever made in
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.680]   the parable that follows, the parable of the wicked husbandmen, from verse 33 to the end
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:53.640]   of the chapter, including this significant statement in verse 43. "Therefore say I unto
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation, bearing forth
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:12.600]   the fruits thereof." There is our Lord addressing the Jewish nation as represented in particular
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.720]   by its religious leaders. And what he says to them, having spoken his parable, you remember,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.480]   of the wicked husbandmen, he says, summing it up and emphasizing its message, "The
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:35.320]   kingdom shall be taken from you and given to a nation, bearing forth the fruits thereof."
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.960]   Then you go on to Matthew 22, and in the first fourteen verses you've got the parable of
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.440]   the king's marriage feast and the men who went in, you remember, without his wedding
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   garment, clearly again dealing with exactly the same subject. And there is no doubt at
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:59.840]   all that the parable of the barren fig tree in Luke 13, verses 6 to 9, obviously deals
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:06.160]   with the same thing. The fig tree is to be left for yet another year. It's to have
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.800]   a three-year trial corresponding with the ministry of our Lord, and unless it bears
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:17.960]   fruit at the end it is to be cut down. Undoubtedly it has reference to this subject.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:24.980]   But take all those statements and put them with what you find in the first epistle of
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:33.200]   Peter, the second chapter and the ninth verse. 1 Peter 2.9, where you read this, "But ye
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:42.440]   are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:49.560]   should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his most marvellous
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:58.360]   light." What is the significance of that? It's this, that it is a repetition of what
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:03.480]   God said to the children of Israel before he gave them the Ten Commandments. You will
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.200]   find it in the book of Exodus in the nineteenth chapter and the fifth verse. God there said
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:17.240]   to the children of Israel that they were a holy nation, his peculiar people, a kingdom
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:23.520]   of priests. They were his people, the only people of all the nations of the earth. They
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.640]   are his peculiar possession, his peculiar treasure. They are a kingdom of priests. They
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   are a holy nation. But you see, the apostle Peter in that first epistle of his in the
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:43.440]   second chapter and there in that ninth verse applies to the church, consisting of Gentiles
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:52.680]   as well as Jews, the selfsame words that God had applied to the nation of Israel. And you
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.320]   link that, I say, with that statement in Matthew 21 where our Lord says that the kingdom shall
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:06.040]   be taken from you, it is to be taken from the Jews and given to another nation, bearing
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.680]   forth the fruits thereof. And Peter says about the church, "A holy nation. Here is the
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:20.280]   nation to whom the kingdom is given when it has been taken away from the nation of the
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:30.520]   Jews." Now there I've tried to give you some of the evidence on the two sides. And I trust
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.640]   that we shall give due weight and significance to what I have said on the two sides. Consider
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   the evidence, look at those verses, and take them in their context. But that brings us
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:57.200]   to the special and peculiar teaching of this eleventh chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.720]   Romans. Now I confess that I find myself in a difficulty, and in a difficulty for this
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:16.480]   reason that my time has almost gone. And I don't want to start this great subject and
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.760]   have to stop halfway through. I obviously and clearly can't deal with it this evening.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:28.160]   Let me put it like this to you. Let me set you some homework. Let me set you a task for
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:36.280]   this coming week. The task I set you is to read chapters 9, 10, and 11 of the epistle
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:44.760]   to the Romans, and to study them carefully. In order that we may arrive together at a
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:56.040]   conclusion with regard to the meaning of this crucial phrase, "And so all Israel shall
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.880]   be saved." That's the question. What does that mean exactly? What does the apostle mean
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:10.800]   when he says, "And so all Israel shall be saved"? What does he mean indeed in the whole
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:18.240]   of that eleventh chapter? What is he teaching about the Jews? Now let me tell you this.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:26.680]   There are three main lines of exposition again that have been traditionally put forward.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.340]   And I think you'll find it a very interesting and absorbing task to read these three chapters
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:38.040]   in the light of these three possibilities. One school of thought says that what he means
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:49.760]   by "all Israel" is the entire number of the elect or the saved from amongst the Jews and
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.840]   the Gentiles. All Israel, in other words, according to that interpretation, is the church
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:04.520]   of God. All the redeemed, all the saved, whether they were Jews, whether they were Gentiles.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.600]   That's one possibility. That all Israel there, and as it's used in the sixth chapter of the
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.640]   epistle to the Galatians, means simply all converted, redeemed, regenerated people. The
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:29.440]   second exposition says this, that it means the restoration of Israel as a people, as
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:36.760]   a nation. Now there have been two subdivisions of that school. There have been those who
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:42.240]   have said that it means the Jewish people in general, that it doesn't mean that every
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:48.920]   single Jew who will be alive when our Lord returns shall be saved. They say that's ridiculous.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.320]   What it does mean is, though, that there will be such a large number that you really will
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   be able to speak of the Jewish nation as redeemed. But there is another school which teaches,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:09.800]   and teaches very confidently, that when our Lord returns, every single individual Jew
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.760]   that will be alive will be converted. They say all means all, and when it says all Israel,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:23.000]   it means every single individual Jew. Indeed, some have even gone further and said this,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.040]   that the apostle is here teaching that every Jew that has ever lived is going to be saved,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.200]   and that not only will all who are still alive be saved, that all who are already dead will
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.360]   all be resurrected in order that they may be saved. They say all Israel means all Israel,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.880]   and if there's one missing, it's no longer all Israel. That's the second interpretation,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:56.520]   and it is a reference to the salvation of the Jewish nation. And remember the two subdivisions?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   The first which says not every single individual Jew, but such numbers as will entitle you
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.920]   to say, well, the Jewish nation has been saved, not just an odd Jew here and there, but the
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:15.600]   nation. But then there is a third possible interpretation, and it's this one, that what
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:29.360]   Paul means by all Israel here is the total number of elect Jews, the total number of
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:37.200]   Jews that are to be saved. Now then, hold those three possible interpretations in your
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.560]   mind. The third means, you see, that Paul is thinking of a spiritual Israel, and only
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.440]   of a spiritual Israel, that he's not thinking nationally at all. That he's teaching, if
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.800]   you like, that as there is a fullness of the Gentiles, there is also to be a fullness of
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.760]   the Jews, so that the final church will consist of the fullness of the Israelites and the
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:09.080]   fullness of the Gentiles in the church. If I, of course, began to tell you of the various
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.680]   other subdivisions of these theories that have been put forward, well, we would never
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:21.520]   finish our exposition, because there have been all sorts of ideas, but there is a very
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.360]   common teaching at the present time, as you know, which does teach that the Jews as a
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:33.120]   nation are going to have a very special place, that the nation is going to be put into a
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.760]   very special position in God's redemption, so that you will have a saved church and saved
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:45.960]   Jewish nation. Now, I ask you to consider whether such ideas are scriptural or not,
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:53.360]   and I will attempt, God willing, next Friday evening to put before you the arguments up
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:00.720]   to a point on the one side and on the other. Now, are we all clear in our minds as to what
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:07.560]   we are doing? We are still considering the time of the Second Coming, and at this point
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:16.680]   I am saying that there are going to be certain signs before our Lord comes again. One is
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:25.120]   the conversion of the Gentiles. The second is the one we are now considering, this fullness
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:38.240]   of the Jews, this teaching about the conversion of a certain number of Jews, this all Israel
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.800]   that is going to be saved.
