[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Cindy from the Financial Samurai podcast and in this episode
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.860]   I want to try to argue with my wife as to why we should upgrade homes at this point in our lives and
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.760]   She will argue against why we should upgrade homes. So Cindy I
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.860]   Have seen this home on the market for the past year and a month
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.280]   It was listed at a certain price last year to me
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.060]   It was my dream home because that a huge lot huge front yard huge backyard totally remodeled one more
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.360]   Bedroom two more bathrooms more areas to play and no stress that if we let the kids outside
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.840]   they won't run on the street because it's an enclosed front yard and
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.280]   I really wanted to buy this home. I'm glad I didn't because you know the tech market
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.280]   Started collapsing and you know, San Francisco barrier was like not too hot in 2022, but things are coming back and I have another
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.320]   opportunity to buy this house
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.280]   so
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.720]   We're in our mid 40s. Now. Our kids are three and a half and six years old
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.760]   They are gonna be with us for the next
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.480]   12 to 15 years and then that's it and I've written in the past that the best time to own the nicest house you can
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.860]   Afford is when we have the most number of heartbeats at home, which in this case are our children
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.200]   Afterwards, we don't need a bigger house. We don't need a nicer house
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.760]   We probably will just keep our same house or downgrade because it'll just be the two of us and hopefully them visiting
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.320]   Multiple times a year. So please tell me and listeners. Why?
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.440]   Shouldn't we upgrade homes? We've been in this home for the past three years now. It's done well for us
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.280]   But we have this opportunity at a lower price
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, first of all, it's just not necessary
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   Yeah, I mean there's there's real estate opportunities all the time right and they don't have to be physical
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.960]   real estate properties right you talk about real estate crowdfunding opportunities all the time and
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.280]   there's different ways to invest in real estate and
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.800]   I just don't feel that it's necessary. We have a home that's more than big enough for our family
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   It's a great layout. It's in a location that we like it's got a nice view
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.560]   It's it's very comfortable and it works really well for us right now
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.520]   So I don't feel that we need anything more. I'm also pretty easy to please I don't
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   need
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   the latest fanciest
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.920]   construction
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.960]   materials and you know
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.040]   The fanciest faucet or whatever I actually don't like things that are too fancy because they break easier
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760]   they're much harder to replace and
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560]   There's different stresses that come along with it and you're giving me a look
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.840]   Like you're frustrated
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.880]   So that's you know, just my first little spiel
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   You know, I
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.200]   there's just a
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.760]   lot of logistics that also go into moving and
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, we can hire people to pack our stuff and move for us. That's just not my style and
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.800]   I just feel
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.120]   Happy with where we are. So I'm really content. So for me, I
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.560]   Am NOT in a rush and and yes
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.640]   I understand what you're saying about living in the best house that you can afford when you have kids living at home
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   I I don't disagree with that
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.040]   But I feel like our current home
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.340]   Meets it checks all of my boxes
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.840]   yeah, and I feel like this particular house that you are very interested in as
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.080]   some boxes
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.080]   Sorry is missing some boxes that our current home has yeah, you know we have you know
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.320]   you know disagreement on some of them, but
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   you know things that are more important to you to me than me and vice versa, but I
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.400]   Don't feel like this other house is significantly better than what we already have
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.880]   I feel like your argument because you've thrown out so many points got diluted
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   Diluted with all these points about I'm happy. I'm comfortable
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Doesn't check all the boxes
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.080]   Etc, etc
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.880]   In my maybe you just feel that I'm arguing a very good case. No like your side is
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.040]   So so let me let me just one point the argument of not wanting to move
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.600]   To me the idea of not wanting to move in pack boxes. Yes you because I'm the one that's always done
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.320]   All of the packing and the logistics and hiring the movers and you know, that's my stress
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.000]   That's your stress. I know how stressful and how long it is. I don't like hiring people to pack
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   Okay, that's just I just don't like to do that
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.860]   Some people are comfortable and more than happy to do that, but that's not how I work very well
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.860]   I understand that I hear your point
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.360]   But let me add I
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.360]   Contributed to the moving as well from our other house to this house
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.320]   I think I drove like 40 times and I filled up our car with stuff and moved myself
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.600]   and I was more than willing to do it and I took the attitude of
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.920]   We're gonna move to this new house for the betterment of our family
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.520]   and I'm willing to pack up the car the boxes and load them up and
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.840]   On low offload them as a form of exercise as well
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.600]   It gave me a purpose to do every single day for maybe a couple months
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.880]   and I felt really good about it and as
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:15.800]   The father of the household I feel it's my responsibility to provide it as best and most comfortable and safe environment as
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.900]   Possible. So would you agree or disagree that moving to this house? We currently live in was the right move in 2020
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:32.960]   Yes, and it was a different situation because we were also moving out of a construction zone and
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   When did the house that we were living in prior to here?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   It wasn't as we didn't have as much space because the construction wasn't completed. So it's not apples to apples
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.800]   Right. It's not apples to apples, but I made a decision in
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.560]   2020 after
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.480]   How many months of living in our other owning our house for about a year and doing some construction that?
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.240]   You know what this remodeled house that we currently live in would provide a better life for our family
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.400]   during an especially uncertain time and
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.620]   It was a very risky move to take on debt to buy this more expensive house while also having our other house
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.960]   under construction which cost money
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:24.120]   But three years later, I think this was one of the best lifestyle decisions we ever made
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   To have these levels to have the view
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.040]   Best best lifestyle decision. There you go. There's no need to
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.840]   compare to
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   Owning the other house
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.480]   But that's the thing. Nobody needs to do anything
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.120]   You know, we can just eat
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.040]   cereal and water every single day
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.440]   Not, you know pursue promotions and raises
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.520]   Well, that's I'm saying you don't need anything else you just
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.000]   Well, some people are lactose intolerant. Okay, let's
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.520]   Let's let's be thoughtful for those people. What I'm saying is that none of us need to do anything
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.000]   we don't need to buy one more pair of pants or another t-shirt or
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.440]   Get anything fancy. We can just sit static
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.160]   for the rest of our lives or
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.680]   We can identify opportunities which I have seen and identified with this home, which is now lower in price
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.760]   So it's more affordable yet. The stock market has recovered by over 12% year-to-date in
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.800]   2023 and it's up over 20% since October 12 2022, which means that our investments are also up
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.840]   so there's a double benefit financially here of
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.360]   increased investments a rebound at least and
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.000]   also a decline in the price of
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.400]   This forever home, but you're leaving out all the all of the rental properties, right?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.440]   if we're going to move we haven't discussed anything about
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:07.480]   Decreasing the number of rental properties that we have. Well, that's gonna happen in due time because I do agree
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   Managing three rentals in San Francisco is my limit. So I don't want to manage for that's just it sounds disastrous
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.040]   Really? Maybe I hire a property manager to manage it, but then I have to manage the manager
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.720]   however, I
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.320]   have realized that I'm actually a good landlord or
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:32.120]   Someone who underprices the rental properties because we haven't had a rental property vacancy in years
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   I think five six years now
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:41.200]   When I was trying to figure out how to cobble together money to pay cash for this target forever home
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.040]   I was thinking myself. Well, obviously we should sell one rental property and then use the proceeds
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.640]   to buy this house
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:56.960]   But every single rental property that I reviewed has had a tenant for one two, three five six years
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   And I don't know when they're gonna leave but eventually one of the tenants will leave
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.960]   Over the next three years and we can sell one of these properties. I
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.000]   Just feel like it's it's over complicating things. I mean life is complicated
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.600]   But you've taught you've written about how as we age
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.600]   We need to make our lives less complicated
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.840]   right
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.580]   but you know, I I totally agree with what I've written you should and I do believe in
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:34.080]   Minimalism and retirement they go hand in hand because if you're a parent and you have aging parents to take care of
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.160]   Whoo, there's a lot of complications in life. Yeah, I'm dealing with a lot right now with with my own
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.720]   Yeah, I hear you but one of the responsibilities of being a thoughtful good parent
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.600]   Is not thinking about ourselves. It's thinking about our children. Oh, come on our children are
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.200]   Happy in this house. What are you talking about? What are you trying to?
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.080]   what I'm saying is we as
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:11.680]   Adults have the ability to invest for our children's future today. Our kids are three and a half and six
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.520]   they have no idea about investing saving the struggles of life the difficulties of
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   globalization and all that stuff
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.920]   Just imagine when you were three years old or six years old if you had parents
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:31.600]   Who foresaw the future and who thought about your future a little bit more carefully and invested for them?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.200]   How much better you'd be?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   Well, that's a whole nother
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.600]   Discussion that you know, we don't want to get sidetracked on right now
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   But I think people can argue it the other way if you grow up without a lot
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.760]   It strikes fear in you, you know, I I grew up with a lot of fear
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.960]   I'm not having money as my own money as an adult because I knew I couldn't count on my parents
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:04.240]   So it motivated me to work hard if I knew that my parents were very well off and that they would take care of me
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.960]   I probably would have taken
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.000]   More risks in college and not gone a very practical route that I knew
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.080]   Would get me to a reliable career path that would generate enough income for me to you know
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   be financially independent, so
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   we
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.040]   For getting such no, we're not getting sidetracked because everything is a line when we
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.600]   Purchase property or anything we have to think about ourselves
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:40.960]   But more importantly our children you already have you already have you already have investment properties for our children
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.080]   We don't need we don't need anything. This is the thing. We don't need anything
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.880]   Nobody needs nothing
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.040]   Well, here's the thing if you want to talk about decumulation
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   The best way to decumulate income and assets is to buy an expensive home
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.240]   There's all these property taxes fees maintenance
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.200]   You know, you got to spend your money to buy that home. The easiest way to spend money is actually to buy a home
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   but but going back to
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.960]   Spoiling our children is what you're thinking
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:21.460]   It's not for them. It's an insurance policy for them. Okay, it's not like hey guys
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.200]   There's rental property in a stock portfolio. It's all for you. Once you graduate high school or college
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.680]   Don't have to worry about your future. Nope. It's not that way at all that it's not that's not your intention
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   No, it doesn't mean that they won't
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.760]   Think Oh one day when mom and dad died
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.880]   Let's say we die
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.180]   We can't prevent them from thinking but they're logical to conclude that when we're 85 years old, okay
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.360]   I don't want to put a number because it's kind of depressing
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.920]   They're gonna be you know 50s and 60s. Are you gonna?
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   screw your whole life for a
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.480]   Inheritance that may or may not come at the age of 50 55 or 60. No, of course not. I don't know
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   We don't know the future
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.360]   But I think our kids are probably if if they see that we have all these different houses
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.560]   They're probably gonna think that they're gonna
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.480]   Come out with something
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.880]   Yeah, maybe maybe not. I'm gonna keep on making them pull the weeds
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.200]   Do the landscaping, you know figure out where the mysterious fire alarm is coming from
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   Which was within the walls within the walls. I
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.440]   Have an interesting analogy about buying a nice house and not regretting it
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.160]   So in my 20s and in my 30s, I was car obsessed
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.420]   But then I finally, you know came to my senses and said, you know
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:54.080]   I better invest that money instead of buy a nice car. And so instead of buying a nice car
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.940]   I had used cars very inexpensive
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.540]   until
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.460]   2016 December 2016 when we bought the Range Rover Sport for
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:10.540]   $58,000 and about $60,000 after tax and this was the most amount of money I spent on a car
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.460]   since I was
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.340]   25 years old. I went crazy and bought a g500 at 25 years old because
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.780]   Mercedes-Benz had dropped the price of the g500 by 50%
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.580]   because this one
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:32.020]   Distribution company in Santa Fe, New Mexico was bought out and they didn't have a monopoly anymore. Anyway
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.940]   My point of this story is that I bought the car in December
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.540]   2016 and now it's in 2023 and I don't regret a
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.780]   single penny
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.780]   That I bought this car
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.900]   It's an expensive car, but I don't regret it at all for the past seven years almost seven years
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.340]   we've been driving a nice car that I felt has been safe and reliable and
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:00.340]   so when it comes to a home where we live and create memories and
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:06.100]   Experiences. Why are you laughing? I'm laughing because you don't regret buying this home
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:16.380]   No, what I'm saying is we can buy this nicer home with more memories we can invite more people over we can have it
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:22.480]   Actually have a bouncy house in our front yard and have you know, just more socialization and friends
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.020]   I think it would be so much more fun. And so I don't think we're gonna regret buying this home 12 years from now
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:35.100]   After our kids go away. I think we're like wow, we were able to maximize our
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:42.460]   Lifestyles with the income and wealth that we accumulated during the most important times of our lives
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.980]   I just don't think we'll regret it
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.940]   I have been to so many open houses over the past 20 years in San Francisco
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.420]   I've seen more expensive homes in fancier neighborhoods
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.540]   I have not seen a home this nice at this price point for this value
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.660]   Ever it almost feels like destiny that this home is still available
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:11.420]   I was so close to borrowing money from a friend to try to buy this home in May 2022 and
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:18.100]   They wouldn't accept our offer and then imagine a year later with the market
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:25.500]   Rebounding well the market you go down and then rebounding and then the price cut and then them saying hey
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.260]   You know what? Maybe we will entertain your offer
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.900]   That just seems like we're destined to own this home
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.740]   I'm not saying that it's not a good opportunity
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:45.500]   From an investment point of view and a lifestyle more importantly a lifestyle. I don't think there's a significant difference in lifestyle
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.460]   Then why do people buy bigger nicer homes?
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.740]   FOMO or just feeling like they have to keep up with the Joneses. I don't know
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.780]   I've to me I don't feel that there will be a significant difference in lifestyle quality at this other house
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.980]   Well, let me make this argument here
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:09.100]   I do believe there will be a significant increase because for me as a father
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:16.060]   I fear our children running on the streets and getting hit by cars out front
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.940]   We live in a big city
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.940]   So this home has a gated front yard where they can play for hours and hours with no fear
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.300]   Okay, if that's your biggest fear, then there's an alternative
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.940]   Moving we can
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.180]   Alter the front of this house
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:41.220]   Install a gate. No, we can't remember the city like made us take down planter boxes on our property because it's public right away
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.220]   I know this city is
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.300]   You we cannot install anything in front of our house. I'm getting frustrated
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:55.140]   Well, I I hear your frustration and I'm sorry to make you frustrated. It's really the city. We should be frustrated
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:02.940]   Because the city has nothing else better to do than to tell people to take down their planter boxes and to tell people that those
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.220]   free library
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.940]   Hutch's that they have outside their house or
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:16.500]   Yeah illegal just all kinds of ridiculous stuff. All right. Well, we've had I think a
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.700]   Productive but maybe not so productive discussion. I don't seem to be able to get you to budge
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.180]   I'm not I'm not saying it's it's a bad house when you look at it for what it is
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.980]   It's a nice property. It was remodeled very well. They used really high quality materials
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   They obviously spent a lot of time and money doing it. And so I understand why this cellar is
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.220]   Stubborn, but yeah, the cellar does seem quite stubborn
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:52.500]   And it has you know a lot of emotion tied up into the property
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.620]   I just you know, it sounds
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.220]   Maybe silly to say but I don't want to lose the ocean view that we have at this house
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.480]   It's it means a lot to me
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.900]   And it's something that I really really enjoy
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:16.740]   Every day throughout the whole day that this other house doesn't have it has other things like the yard
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.100]   Valley view I
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.860]   Don't know it's just
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:29.580]   There's no perfect house. I will say that no house checks every single box that you want unless you build it from scratch
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:36.420]   But even if you build it from scratch, there's no guarantee that there won't be things that go wrong. We've had that happen to friends
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:43.540]   Sure. I think this might this argument might be a reflection of something bigger
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.180]   one of
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.180]   Person me being a risk taker and
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.020]   one of you
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.220]   being
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.260]   Not a risk taker and I think over time
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.980]   Risk taking has enabled us to live
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:06.180]   the lifestyles that we currently have if we didn't take risks
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:12.660]   For example, if I didn't leave my job in 2012 if you didn't negotiate a service in 2015
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:18.140]   We would have different lifestyles. I don't know if it'd be worse or better. It would just be different
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.940]   I think our lifestyles currently are great and that's because we took risks now
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:30.660]   Sometimes risks don't pay off. Sometimes we lose a lot of money. Sometimes we might upgrade homes and I wrote in this article
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.620]   there are some things that we might not expect such as maybe bad neighbors or
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.820]   more traffic than expected or
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:46.900]   Really noisy dog that barks all day long, right? You just don't really know until you actually live in the house for a while
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.940]   24/7 for weeks on end and yes
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:58.300]   Maybe the economy and the stock market and the real estate market go back down again in the second half of 2023 or 2024
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.380]   Because we've had 10 rate hikes and maybe there'll be another one and it takes
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.360]   Six months to a year for rate hikes to slow down the economy
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:13.180]   It sure seems like all the data is pointing towards lower inflation and a slowdown
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:19.700]   But we don't really know the extent of a potential downturn in the future and on the flip side
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.580]   things could continue to rebound as
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:30.540]   AI and corporate profits drive stock prices and the economy higher. So let me ask you Sydney what?
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:36.060]   Would make you change your mind about us buying this new house?
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:42.140]   What is the compromise it's hard like
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:49.300]   One of the biggest things that is is like I said, I don't want to lose the ocean view and that's not something that you
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.300]   can
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.740]   Add. Oh, yeah, you won't lose the ocean view. You know why?
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.460]   Because we'll keep owning this house
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.380]   But that's not the same. It's not the same
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:07.200]   That's true. We can always go for a walk or a drive to the other side of the hill to see the ocean
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.500]   Okay
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   You're saying your argument is
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.540]   That if we can find a nice house with an ocean view then you'll be more amenable
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:26.340]   Potentially, but there's a lot of other things that have to have to gel like what?
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.980]   Come on the layout the location, you know
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:38.500]   The cost obviously is a huge one. Yeah, the the
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.700]   Front yard backyard if there is one, you know, whether it's
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.740]   Touching the neighbor's house or if there's I forgot what it's called, you know if there's
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.140]   Stand-alone stand-alone, you know, there's just there's so many things I guess imagine
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.580]   Imagine you're in this new house
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:05.300]   Well, you mean this house right? No new house the target new house if you were in this new house
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   Do you think you would be unhappy?
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.780]   There's us I'm not saying I would be unhappy, but I'm definitely not unhappy now
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:26.620]   All right, folks, I'm sorry, but I think we've reached an impasse here
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:33.840]   If you are having this big dilemma with your significant other on whether to upgrade homes
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.860]   I highly suggest you read my post on the risks of upgrading homes
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:45.080]   Nobody thinks about also another post called the top 10 warning signs before buying a house or the top 10 red flags
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.960]   I'll put it in the show notes buying a home really is taking a leap of faith
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.720]   Especially if you need to take out mortgage debt
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:59.360]   Especially if you don't know for sure where you want to live five years from now or how much you're gonna be making
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.200]   Even the next year or two years from now many many things to consider
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.560]   I highly recommend you follow my 30 33 to 5 rule for home buying it's
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   very
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.940]   very healthy way to look at things because the last thing you want to do is buy a home and then
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:21.000]   Not be able to sleep well at night because you're always stressed out about the payments and the future of the economy and the stock
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.640]   market and the real estate market
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.120]   based on my experience
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.320]   there's another metric that I like to use when buying a home and
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:34.120]   That's to try to keep the value of the home to no more than 30% of your net worth now
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.240]   It's gonna be hard if you're buying your first home or you're upgrading homes
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.800]   But once you get your primary residence to 30% or less
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.280]   You will feel more at peace less stressed out
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:52.720]   Thanks so much everyone for listening. We hope you enjoyed our arguments of this back and forth
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.980]   I I feel I've made a little bit of a difference
