[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Pastor John, I am anticipating your chapter
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.880]   that will be published in the forthcoming book
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.920]   titled From Heaven He Came and Sought Her,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.900]   Definite Atonement in Historical, Biblical, Theological
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.740]   and Pastoral Perspective,
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160]   edited by David Gibson and Jonathan Gibson.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.240]   It should be out from Crossway in November.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.520]   Your chapter is, I think, the most persuasive thing
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.840]   I've read on the definite atonement of Christ,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.400]   and I was wondering if you would just,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.240]   in three or four minutes,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.440]   introduce definite atonement to us,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   explain why it's so important to you,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.140]   and what's at stake for the church.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.400]   - It is important.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.240]   Sometimes it's called limited atonement,
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.800]   which is an unfortunate designation
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.760]   because it seems to minimize or diminish
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.080]   the work of the atonement,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.960]   when in fact, what we're arguing is not for something less
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.340]   than others believe, but for something more.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.820]   And what I mean by that is this.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.440]   The Bible speaks about God loving the world,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   and he speaks about Christ being the savior of all,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.160]   especially those who believe.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.480]   And I think in that little phrase,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.160]   what I wanna say is,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   Christ dies, in a sense, for all,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.160]   but not in the same sense, for all.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.720]   In the sense that he dies for all,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.320]   we mean that he dies in such a way
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.280]   that you can offer his death to all, without exception,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.680]   and say to them, with no qualm, here is Christ.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.400]   I offer Christ to you.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   If you will believe Christ, it is yours.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.680]   Everything he bought from the Father for eternal life,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.880]   he bought for you, if you will have it.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.760]   So that big, if you will have it,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.400]   enables us to preach the gospel indiscriminately
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.640]   to every single person on the planet and say,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   this death will cover your sins, if you will believe it.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.760]   What the people believe, like me,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.720]   who believe that there's more, not less, more to it,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   is that he also, God had a definite intention
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.240]   or design in the atonement.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.120]   Christ loved the church and gave himself for her,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.160]   meaning he has a special love for the church,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   a special design in the giving of his Son for the church.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.800]   God has in view the church in a special way when he dies.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.960]   And here's what's special,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   here's what persuades me about the definite atonement.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   In the new covenant, in Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 36
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.720]   and Ezekiel 11, it says that God will take out
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.160]   the heart of stone, he will put in the heart of flesh,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.760]   he will give us a new spirit,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520]   he will write the law on our hearts.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.600]   And then Jesus lifts up the cup
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   at the last supper in Luke 22, 20,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.960]   and he says this cup, meaning this blood, this death,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.280]   is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.440]   So what Christ's blood does is purchase for us
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.480]   the benefits of the new covenant.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.200]   And the new covenant benefits are not simply
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   the offer of salvation, the new covenant
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.240]   is precisely the effecting of salvation
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.080]   and the preserving of those who are saved.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   Taking out the heart of stone
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.600]   and putting in the heart of flesh
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.960]   and writing on our hearts the law.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.880]   So when we talk about the new birth
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.720]   or when we talk about Ephesians 2, 5,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.160]   that he made us alive together with Christ,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.080]   that act of mercy, I argue,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   was purchased for me by the blood of Christ.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.800]   Well, if my new birth and if my receiving
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.240]   a heart of flesh and my heart of stone being taken out
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   was purchased for me in the new covenant transaction
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.180]   by the blood of Jesus, then that atoning work
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.880]   is what saved me.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   Didn't just offer me salvation,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.880]   didn't just make me favorable,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.080]   it actually rescued me, it changed me,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.200]   it gave me the gift of faith.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.440]   When it says in 2 Timothy 2, 25,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.920]   that God may perhaps give them repentance,
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.680]   well, if I have repentance, God did give me repentance
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.240]   and that giving of repentance to me
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   and the giving of faith to me, according to Ephesians 2, 8,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.240]   is a purchase of the blood of Christ for me.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180]   I didn't deserve that gift, he bought it for me,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.840]   which means he does that uniquely for the elect,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.520]   for the bride of Christ.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.040]   And here's one of the practical implications of that,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.600]   a couple of practical implications.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   One is, I want the church to feel loved by Christ
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.560]   in the covenant way that he really loves his bride.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.160]   He loved his bride and went after her
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   and he purchased her and he brought her home to himself
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.880]   so that we don't just feel ourselves loved generically,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.520]   like we're loved the same way people are loved
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.880]   who are in hell or going to hell.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.040]   We are loved in a covenant way
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.200]   in which God is gonna pursue us,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.220]   he's gonna overcome all our rebellion,
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.440]   he's gonna make us his own,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.240]   he's gonna beautify us for his son
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.800]   and he has fixed his heart on us
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.920]   and we know that because he has put faith in our hearts
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.680]   to embrace him.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.120]   And second implication is, if he has done that,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.640]   if he has brought me out of darkness into light,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.400]   out of death into life by virtue of his atoning work,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.320]   then he's gonna keep me.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.880]   I think Romans 8, 32 functions exactly that way.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.680]   It says that he who did not spare his own son,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.880]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.080]   and that all there is the elect in Romans 8,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.440]   he's followed that through,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.680]   gave him up for us all,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.640]   will he not with him freely give us all things?
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.000]   In other words, if God has died for us,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.520]   will he not keep us forever?
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.560]   The only way to make that argument work
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.840]   is that the dying for us is the securing for a people
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.080]   an everlasting life that includes all the blessings
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.240]   of the new covenant.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.840]   So it is really practically precious
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   for people to work their way through
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.260]   to an understanding of the love of God in Christ
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.600]   for his own.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.480]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   Be watching for Pastor John's chapter
