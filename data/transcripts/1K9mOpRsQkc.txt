[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   All right, so later we have David Sachs joining us
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.920]   in the studio to answer some questions,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.120]   but first I wanted to do a deep dive
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.600]   on an interesting study that a tech company did
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.660]   about meetings.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.140]   So we haven't talked about meetings recently,
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.200]   so let's do a deep dive on the question,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.780]   could this meeting have been an email?
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.720]   Is this article, I have this up on the screen
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.820]   for those who are watching on YouTube.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.460]   The title of this article is, we intentionally canceled
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.780]   every meeting for a week, here's what happened.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.780]   And it is a recent article, it's from the 6th of November.
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.200]   The company in question here is Zapier.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.780]   So I think hardcore sort of world without email fans
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.280]   will know that name, Zapier is used
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.660]   for digital workflow automation.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.640]   One of these cool nerd productivity companies.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.040]   All right, so let me point out a few things
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.140]   from this company.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.600]   First of all, I enjoyed the opening sentence
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.300]   of this article, it reads as follows.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300]   I do my best work when I'm interrupted every 30 minutes
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.480]   for a meeting, said no one ever.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.600]   That's just writing.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.300]   That's a funny way to open an article.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.340]   All right, so the author of this article goes on
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060]   to talk about the types of meetings.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.260]   So the ontology of meetings that pulls at her attention,
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.420]   this list includes project kickoffs, syncs,
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780]   retrospectives, recurring team meetings, and one-on-ones.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.100]   I don't even know what most of those terms mean,
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.220]   but it gives you some sense on the proliferation
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.260]   of meetings, especially within these type
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.060]   of high-tech knowledge work firms.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.860]   So what they decided to try at this company, Zapier,
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.980]   was something they called, Get Stuff Done Week,
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.340]   GSD for short.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.220]   The quote here says, "The idea was that by moving
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.260]   from live calls to asynchronous communication,
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.060]   people could spend more time on deep work."
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.100]   You gotta love, I love the references,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.900]   the commonplace references to deep work,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.140]   because that means it's pervaded the cultural lexicon.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.340]   And yes, get stuff done.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.260]   All right, so this was the idea.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.140]   They were gonna just say, let's try this one week,
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.600]   basically no meetings.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.520]   What are the logistics?
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.460]   They just encourage everyone.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.020]   The leadership says everyone should cancel
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.140]   their internal meetings.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.740]   So yeah, if you have client meetings,
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.820]   you'll have to do those.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.780]   And move the conversations async instead.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.540]   It's engineer talk for asynchronous.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.420]   So instead of live back and forth,
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.280]   documents, email, task systems, et cetera.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.620]   All right, they did this for one week.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.620]   Here is some examples of what this particular person
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   did to replace these meetings.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.140]   So let's get specific.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.620]   So she said, instead of her weekly one-on-one,
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.100]   which by the way, I don't even know what that is.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.300]   Again, I've never had a real job.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.260]   So a lot of this is sometimes new to me.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320]   But instead of her weekly one-on-one,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.900]   she consolidated questions for my manager
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.060]   and sent them to her in a direct message on Slack.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.260]   Okay, so I'm assuming a one-on-one
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.780]   is where you get together with your manager
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.980]   and say, "What are we doing this week?"
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.840]   Jesse's nodding his head.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   So I have that right?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.140]   - Yep. - Okay.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.100]   Instead of a project check-in,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.940]   all team members shared their updates
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.020]   in the relevant Asana tasks.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.420]   All right, Asana is a task board.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.340]   I talk about task boards a lot in a world without email.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.140]   A centralized transparent place
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.920]   where all ongoing tasks can be seen, organized,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.220]   and have relevant information attached to them.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.460]   So Asana is just a one of these task board systems
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.620]   that's liked by computer programmer types.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.940]   Instead of a one-off strategy call,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.940]   stakeholders shared their thoughts in a Coda doc.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.160]   All right, I don't know what a Coda doc is,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.420]   but I get what they're saying here
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.980]   is instead of like, "Let's just get on the call
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.240]   and talk about this particular new thing
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.420]   we need a strategy for."
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.000]   They instead wrote down their thoughts
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.940]   in some sort of shared document situation.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.580]   And finally, instead of a project kickoff call,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.200]   our project manager sent a Slack message
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.740]   that shared the project charter timeline and next steps.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.660]   That's probably the most relevant information
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.980]   from those kickoff meetings anyway.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.300]   So let's just get that information posted.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.900]   Why do we have to spend 30 minutes talking about it?
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.380]   All right, so what was interesting here
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.180]   is this particular employee who is not a manager said,
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.020]   "Hey, this went well.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.860]   I normally spend between six and 10 hours in meetings."
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.060]   So that's six or 10 hours she got back.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.460]   But look at this.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.520]   She says, "From what I can tell,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   it was even more impactful for managers at Zapier
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   who sometimes spend half their week or more in meetings."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.780]   So for the technical employees, this is 10 hours back,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.300]   which you can get a lot done in,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.500]   especially when you think about the way
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.280]   that the meetings is not the total time,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.900]   that's not the only toll.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.380]   It's also the fragmentation of time.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.460]   So these meetings might be short,
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.940]   10 hours might be 20 half hour meetings,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.860]   and those are sprinkled throughout your week,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.540]   breaking up long stretches of time
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.220]   so they could eliminate almost any long stretches of time.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.740]   So the damage of 10 hours worth of meetings
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.680]   is bigger than just 10 hours of work.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.860]   But look at this, managers at Zapier could spend 50%
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.100]   or more, 20 plus hours in meetings.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.900]   So this particular employee talked to her manager
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.080]   and got some quotes.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.140]   So her manager, Caitlin, said things such as,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.140]   "Zoom calls tend to rule my calendar,
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.420]   especially doing check-ins."
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.260]   The manager said, "The most surprising part
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.700]   of not having these weekly check-ins
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.980]   was that I actually didn't feel disconnected
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.020]   from my team at all."
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.540]   You're still working and communicating, just differently.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.980]   The manager also said, "Instead of cramming tasks
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.900]   into my short stints between calls like usual,
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.500]   I was able to focus on my responsibilities
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.540]   that require deeper thinking, like long-term strategy,
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.300]   team planning, and cross-functional processes."
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.340]   Also, the manager said, "A week without meetings
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.880]   gave us space for more curiosity and experimentation,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.140]   encouraging us to look at the problems
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.900]   we were trying to solve from a different angle.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.060]   For us, a meeting-less week
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.420]   was far from a meaningless week."
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.840]   I feel like the manager maybe practiced that line
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.240]   before talking to her subordinate for this article.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.120]   I think that's, just think about this though for a second.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.840]   I mean, I think this is really important.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.180]   These managers, if you're spending more than half
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.960]   of your hours on Zoom, this is not consolidated.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.840]   This is not, "Man, every day I have to do meetings
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.720]   from one to five."
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.640]   No, no, no.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.960]   These hours are sprinkled throughout the days
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.340]   so that you probably have never more
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.840]   than about 30 minutes free.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.800]   Maybe occasionally you'll have an hour free
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.840]   without another meeting showing up somewhere
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.680]   on your schedule.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.520]   So basically, these managers were in a state
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   of constant context shifting from one meeting to another
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.160]   with these small areas in between to try to do tasks.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.440]   But let's be honest, tasks mean slack.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.600]   Tasks means trying to keep up
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.320]   with the deluge in the inbox.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.400]   So you're wrenching your cognitive context
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.360]   away from this meeting,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.280]   which probably generated lots of open loops
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   that you don't have time to get to
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.760]   because you have to answer 15 urgent Slack messages
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.720]   before the next meeting puts you into a different context.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.680]   From a psychological perspective,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.300]   that's an almost impossible demand.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.160]   The exhaustion that would engender is going to be pronounced.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   And from a productivity perspective,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.260]   it's gotta be a terrible way to take these high power,
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.700]   highly trained minds and say,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.260]   "Help us organize all of these brains
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.840]   that are organization and create new original things."
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.100]   What a terrible way to actually try to harness that energy.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.020]   So I think this is a fantastic insight
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.620]   of the impact meetings had been having.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.460]   All right, so Zapier didn't wanna just rely on anecdotes.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.860]   They did an internal survey.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.540]   Here's some statistics.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.940]   80% of respondents wanna do this again.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.260]   80% of respondents achieved their goals for the week.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.460]   89% respondents found communication to be as effective
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.180]   during that week as during a typical week.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.260]   There's some goals this writer gives.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.320]   Okay, if you wanna succeed with something like this,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.460]   there are four goals
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.820]   or four pieces of advice we should say.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.860]   One, set goals.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.740]   So having specific goals
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.780]   for what you'll achieve during these weeks,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.940]   these meeting-free weeks,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.900]   makes it much more likely
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.060]   that you'll use those hours productively.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.320]   By the way, that's super telling.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.820]   I think we're so used to this
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.080]   react to incoming in between meetings,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.620]   absurd structure of work,
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.860]   that actually being given open time
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.620]   is something we don't necessarily know what to do with.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.560]   Like I have meetings and I'm doing emails.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.140]   What am I supposed to do when I have two hours free?
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.820]   I think that's interesting that one of the,
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.300]   the number one goal was,
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.880]   plan what you're gonna do with that time.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.500]   By the way, we have some advice here on this podcast for you
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.060]   right about how to plan your time.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.580]   All right, piece of advice number two, go async.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.680]   So they're big on using asynchronous channels.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.500]   So that's, you know, where you write something
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.700]   that someone else can come read it later.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.060]   Future-proof your work is the third tip.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.900]   So she used extra hours to help put in place systems
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.620]   that in the future will make it easier
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.080]   to not have to use meetings.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.160]   More on that in a second.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.340]   And her fourth piece of advice
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.140]   is figure out which meetings matter.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.900]   So actually do reflection.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.400]   If you do one of these weeks, look back and say,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.660]   what was really a problem that we missed?
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.120]   And what did I not miss at all?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.140]   And so when you come out of it,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.080]   if you're still gonna have meetings in your schedule,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.200]   you have some insight on the,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.100]   which of those meetings to prioritize.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.720]   All right, so I think that's an interesting insight
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.880]   into the reality of life
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.800]   in the sort of a modern high-tech knowledge work firm.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.080]   I think it's an interesting insight
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.160]   into what happens when you step away from meetings.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.920]   90% of the employees at this company said,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.640]   nothing bad happened.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   And yet I am sure Zapier is back to what,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.400]   how things were before.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.720]   And this gets to the broader issue
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.800]   with the type of advice I talk about
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.480]   with the type of advice like a meeting-free GSD week.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.560]   Why, if these ways of operating are universally beloved,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.480]   way more effective, way less psychologically draining,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.600]   why don't we do this more often?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.800]   Why aren't these the standards?
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   And I think the answer is because it's hard.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.800]   Just rock and rolling with email, Slack,
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.520]   and be able to throw a Zoom invitation
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.120]   to anyone at any point is,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.000]   in the space of possible productivity configurations,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.180]   a low-energy state.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.040]   It is very easy.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.180]   It does not take much energy.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.720]   It's very flexible.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.760]   The overhead of implementing that is very small
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.720]   because it's just on the fly, let's go.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.540]   Organizations will collapse towards this low-energy state
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.920]   unless there is a huge amount of external energy
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.680]   continually pumped into the organization
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.920]   to try to maintain an alternative configuration.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.320]   The GSD week at Zapier was complicated.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.260]   They used many more asynchronous tools,
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.200]   more structures were needed.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.120]   They were talking about,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.520]   in this one person's example,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.800]   they were talking about annotating a sonnet task.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.280]   They were talking about these CODA documents.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.000]   They're talking about an alternative kickoff procedure
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.760]   for new projects.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.100]   None of this is easy,
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.080]   and it would require buy-in from the top down
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.240]   as well as from the bottom up,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.080]   and a lot of consistent energy being put into,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.280]   this is how we do it now.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.360]   We don't do these type of meetings.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.400]   So it is easier to just be ad hoc.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.220]   And I think we underestimate the power of easy.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.320]   Easy is often bad.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.500]   Easy is often inefficient.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.080]   Easy often exhausts people.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.520]   Easy is often a terrible way to make the most
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.400]   of the assets that a knowledge work company has,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.760]   but it's also very, very difficult to dislodge.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.520]   So to conclude this discussion,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.880]   I wanted to throw in three random pieces of advice
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.700]   about meetings.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.840]   We haven't talked about meetings a lot,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.980]   so let me throw in three random pieces
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.760]   of Cal Newport meeting advice.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.400]   I'll sort of throw this into the mix
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.840]   along with the advice given in this article we just reviewed.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.980]   Number one, to me, the overarching message
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.840]   of what they experienced at Zapier
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.180]   is that all regular collaboration
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.120]   needs a structured process that everyone understands
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.420]   and all relevant stakeholders had a hand in crafting.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.840]   Structured process that says,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.360]   here's how the collaboration happens.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.540]   Here's the information.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.020]   Here's how the information moves.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.220]   Here's how decisions are made.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.100]   These can be a pain to construct,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.280]   but once constructed, it can be way more effective
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.780]   than just saying, we'll throw in a Zoom meeting
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.280]   and email or Slack in between.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.380]   So we saw some structured processes arise
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.280]   in this Zapier example.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.860]   For example, the annotation of Asana tasks
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.940]   that are reviewed every day,
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.800]   as opposed to having check-in meetings.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.300]   The construction of a kickoff document
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.420]   with the project charter and goals, et cetera,
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.140]   that is uploaded to a particular tool called Coda
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.860]   instead of having a kickoff meeting.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.420]   So these are structured collaboration processes.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.620]   All regular collaboration,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.860]   you should try to put in place a process like this
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.620]   that's very clear about here's how the interaction happens.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.780]   And to the extent possible,
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.620]   the answer to that question should move away
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.500]   from unscheduled communication
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.340]   that requires you to check an inbox.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.180]   As much as possible,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.580]   this should move away from having large blanks
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.660]   of unstructured meeting time.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.580]   We'll just figure it out when we all get on Zoom.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.620]   You want more structure than that.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.460]   My second piece of advice,
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.620]   to make any of this type
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.580]   of structured collaboration philosophies work,
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.580]   you need a catch-all.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.180]   This is the biggest thing I saw missing
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.860]   from the discussion in the Zapier article,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.500]   and probably the biggest source of friction
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.740]   that would bring an end to this GSD experiment
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.660]   if they tried to just extend it week after week,
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.360]   is that there will be small things that pop up
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.900]   that require back and forth interaction
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.300]   that will probably be best dispatched if we could just talk.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.940]   And if we're in a remote environment,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.100]   we need to set up a meeting.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.720]   And because it's hard to set up meetings
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   that are less than 30 minutes,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.500]   it's probably gonna eat up 30 minutes of our time.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.060]   So you need catch-alls
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.260]   for the ad hoc discussion requiring issues
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.020]   that will inevitably arise outside of your structures.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.580]   And I think the best catch-all is office hours.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.160]   Every day, every person has a clearly posted time.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.620]   My door is open, my phone is on,
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.540]   I have a Zoom room activated, and I'm in it.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.900]   Short discussions get deferred to office hours.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.520]   If someone tries to email you or hit you up on Slack
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   with something that's gonna require
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.140]   more than just one message back and forth,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.180]   you say, "Great, come to my office hours,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.620]   "we'll talk about it.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.460]   "And if that doesn't work,
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.300]   "I'll come to your next office hours to talk about it."
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.300]   If someone throws a Zoom meeting invite at you,
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.000]   you say, "Why don't we just grab me
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.500]   "at a nearby office hours,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.880]   "let's really see what we're dealing with here.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.400]   "And then if we need a longer meeting, we can set it."
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.860]   So you need these catch-alls.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.580]   The effect of these is significant.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.140]   And finally, reverse meetings,
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.540]   say a term I coined in an earlier episode,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.980]   reverse meetings often generate better insight
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.880]   than standard meetings.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.620]   So in a standard meeting,
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.900]   I gather all of the people that are relevant
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.680]   to something that I'm working on into one place,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.520]   and we talk about it.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.900]   I wanna know what you guys think about it,
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.360]   let's make a plan.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.300]   In a reverse meeting, me as the initiator,
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.940]   instead of summoning five people to come meet with me,
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.780]   I go and talk to each of those five people one-on-one.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.640]   And in an environment with catch-alls like office hours,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.280]   that means I'm gonna go to each of your office hours
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.720]   one by one and talk to you about this issue.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.660]   Much greater insight is extracted from reverse meetings
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.040]   because you get rid of the crowd social dynamics
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.960]   of having a lot of people in the same room.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.880]   You're able to fully extract the thoughts, the feelings,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   and the expertise of each individual person.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.720]   You have more time to synthesize this information.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.480]   You'll probably come to a better decision
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.000]   having done a reverse meeting.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.360]   And your overall impact on people's schedule
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.480]   is greatly minimized.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.040]   If I go through five people's existing office hours,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.080]   I have added nothing to their calendar
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.560]   that wasn't already there.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.660]   If I instead make the five of them get together
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.040]   in a half hour meeting or an hour long meeting
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.640]   outside of that, that's five worker hours
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.960]   I've now sucked out of the system.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.240]   So it's not only more efficient,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.500]   but I also think they gain more insight.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.080]   So those are three random pieces of advice.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   All regular collaboration has to be structured,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.440]   have a catch-all like office hours
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   for what doesn't fit in those structures,
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.400]   depend more on reverse meetings than standard meetings
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.920]   for complicated decisions where expertise is needed
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.640]   or nuanced political emotional issues are at play.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.980]   You're gonna get much better results
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.120]   with the aggregate of one-on-ones
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.320]   instead of getting a lot of people into one room.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.600]   Thoughts on meetings.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.920]   - So with office hours,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.040]   so say you're waiting around and nobody's there,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.100]   is that just a good time to do like an admin block?
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.880]   - Yeah, just be like, okay, I'm gonna go through email
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.380]   or do something lightweight
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.040]   and waiting to see who actually shows up.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   - Yeah. - I'm hearing from more people
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   who are doing these, by the way.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.280]   I've heard from more entrepreneurs
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.120]   who are working on these.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.080]   It used to be the big example was Jason Fried and Basecamp.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.480]   Like they were big on the office hours.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   And when I did a kickoff event for World Without Email,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.720]   it was me and Jason in conversation and we got into that.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   But I've heard from other readers since then.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.620]   It really is effective.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.760]   It really is effective.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   Every day, set time, it can consume so many things
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.840]   that otherwise would have been an email or a meeting.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.520]   And it's an intermediate between this email meeting
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.880]   synchronous, asynchronous dichotomy that we often see.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.240]   So the phrase is often,
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.400]   this meeting could have been an email.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.960]   People really don't like,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   I have to spend 30 minutes or an hour in a meeting
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.200]   for something that could have been dealt with an email.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.220]   But if everything goes to email,
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.960]   you get the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.560]   There really is an efficiency to real time back and forth.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.200]   You and I can figure something out in five minutes
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.880]   that would otherwise take five to 15 messages,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.980]   each of which generates five inbox checks.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.960]   And there we have 50 to 75 context shifts
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.200]   created by this conversation.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.360]   Or we could talk for five minutes.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.000]   Office hours mediates between those two.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.160]   So you get all the advantage of real time interaction,
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   all that efficiency without the schedule devouring overhead
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   of having every conversation have to have its own meeting
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.680]   that holds time on your calendar.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.760]   So it's like one of the number one strategies
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.560]   for an organizational environment that I think
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.480]   one of the most effective single pieces of advice
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.880]   I have for organizations is put office hours in place.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.620]   (upbeat music)
