[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai. I hope everybody is having a wonderful, wonderful
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   holiday season. I am excited about this podcast because I want to introduce a new movement to the
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.320]   world, and that is the DIRE movement. D-I-R-E. Ten years ago, when I first started writing about
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.800]   achieving financial independence early in 2009, I never thought the FIRE movement would reach such
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.040]   a huge level of interest a decade later. After all, only misfits decide to aggressively forego
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.440]   material pleasures, save 50% or more of their incomes, and retire from well-paying jobs in
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.000]   their 30s and 40s. Back in 2009, the lifestyle design movement was all the rage because people
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.560]   were getting blown out of their jobs left and right. Some people went back to graduate school
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.160]   to save face. Others decided to start lifestyle businesses after getting laid off. I, for one,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.560]   figured there was a good chance my head would also roll, which is one of the reasons why I started
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.160]   Financial Samurai that summer. And thanks to a raging bull market that ensued, which is pretty
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.280]   much all luck, life turned out just fine and the FIRE movement picked up steam. And today, I'm here
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.680]   to say we are at peak FIRE right now, perhaps similar to peak cryptocurrencies reached in
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.320]   December 2017. And unfortunately, when you're at the peak, there's usually nowhere to go but down.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.440]   You know we're at peak FIRE because the mass media has latched onto the FIRE movement like a
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.960]   rabid dog which hasn't eaten in weeks. Not a day goes by where there isn't a new story about
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   someone leaving a job early and how they did it. And as an investor, we know that by the time the
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   big media gets hold, it's often too late to invest. Rather, it's probably a more opportune time to
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.480]   sell. Just think about Uber and Lyft finally filing to IPO in 2019. After all these years,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.440]   all the easy money has already been made as private companies, they're now finally hoping to
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.320]   finally cash out to public investors. And I'm sure they will, and they're going to do a wonderfully
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.800]   good job as a result. My job as an investor, and as a personal finance writer, is to do my best to
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.520]   forecast the future. Writing about and talking about what may happen is infinitely more interesting
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   and more risky than writing about the past. Forecasting the future challenges your mind,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.200]   and could make you a rich hero or a broke fool with egg on your face. But as with everything
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.320]   in life, no risk, no reward. Today, my crystal ball is saying the FIRE movement is in for a rude
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.360]   awakening. On the one hand, there is growing disdain against the FIRE movement from the
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.920]   majority of Americans who will never reach financial independence, with the median household
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.440]   income going nowhere over the past 10 years, and actually over the past 20 years, it's been hard
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.560]   for middle class Americans to get ahead. Further, the average American has a pitiful amount saved
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   in their retirement accounts, less than $20,000. When you've been spinning your wheels for so long,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.280]   all this brouhaha about people retiring early to live their fabulous lives in their mom's basement
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   while posting fake Instagram curated pictures about their amazing lives starts to get
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   mighty annoying after a while. And this annoyance turns into rage, and a new movement is born.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.560]   And on the other side are FIRE practitioners, who are finding out that not all is sunshine and
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.760]   rainbows once they've quit a stable job with wonderful benefits. They're finding out, hey,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.320]   quitting a job at the top of the market and then it goes down 10, 20, 30% might not be a good thing
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   as that income that you're relying on goes away. So with a slowdown in the economy on the horizon,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.000]   things are just not looking good. The Fed is on a mission to suffocate the economy with more rate
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.760]   hikes. The current administration wants to further escalate trade wars because of alpha male ego.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.960]   Do we really need to arrest the CFO of Huawei after you guys just met and said hey, we're going
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   to talk about good trade de-escalation policies? No matter how adversely it affects the stock market,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.640]   it seems like hey, we must conquer you and win. Meanwhile, the housing market has gone past its
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.000]   peak, the peak was probably in the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter of 2018,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.280]   and will likely continue to be in the doldrums for the next several years.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   So when a downturn hits, if it hasn't already, it's an inevitability that FIRE followers will
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.520]   be forced to go back to work and earn their retirements the old-fashioned way. Some might
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.880]   even say FIRE during a recession stands for Foolish Idealist Returns to Employer. However,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.360]   as long as we keep the FIRE acronym alive, we give hope to its original meaning, and when all is lost
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.240]   but false hope persists, people get into further trouble. Therefore, let's eliminate FIRE entirely
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.720]   from our psyche so that we can finally make a change. Nothing happens until you're feeling the
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:12.880]   pain. So let me introduce the newest retirement movement to the world. DIRE. D-I-R-E. As a realist
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.400]   who sees the future, it is all but a certainty the DIRE movement will supplant the FIRE movement
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   as the retirement path of choice. Let's find out why by going through the letters one by one.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   D is for delay. For most people, delaying retirement due to the rapid rise in costs for
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.040]   housing, health care, and education is the only logical way to survive. Look, the median household
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   income is $61,000. That's about the same as it was 20 years ago. Meanwhile, median home prices
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.360]   in America have risen from about $177,000 to $222,000. That's quite a big jump for a no-income
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.160]   change during the same time period. Housing is simply less affordable, and in some cities,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.840]   real estate prices have appreciated so quickly that most residents have no hope of ever owning.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.280]   Health care costs are out of control, especially if you plan to carry the entire monthly premium
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.200]   burden yourself. The average total health care cost is now about $20,000 a year, subsidized
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.360]   mostly by the employer. Once you're out of a job, the entire $20,000 burden falls on you,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.000]   unless you have a low enough income to qualify for subsidies. So for example, a family of three,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.880]   I pay $1,760 a month, or $21,120 a year for a platinum plan. Does that sound reasonable to you?
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.120]   Hell no! None of us are overweight, none of us have chronic illnesses, and we're still
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.760]   paying out the nose. Now let's look at education, specifically college tuition has grown unbearable
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.280]   with annual tuition increases averaging 5 to 7% a year, regardless of whether it's a recession or
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.120]   not. That's a doubling of tuition every 10 to 15 years, folks. Good luck retiring early if you've
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.720]   got to pay $50,000 to $100,000 a year for tuition alone for four or five years for even just a
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.440]   single child. And for parents with kids, you know, bottom line, retiring early will be all but a pipe
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.280]   dream. There will always be at least one parent working full time to earn a steady income and have
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   subsidized health care. The non-working parent can shout from the top of their lungs they are fire as
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   loud as they want, but nobody will buy it. Being a stay at home dad or mom is nothing to be shamed
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.040]   about, folks. Yet for the man especially, it's really interesting. He can't seem to accept his
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:42.240]   new reality of living off his wife's income. Grow up. I is for inherit. With no hope of retiring
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.040]   early, many Americans are counting on inheritance as a retirement strategy. With 25 years old as the
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.240]   median age when parents had kids in the 70s, and the median life expectancy currently hovering
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.520]   around 80, the average American will likely have to wait until around 65 to inherit anything.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.280]   Today, the average age when women start to have children is 28. Therefore, future generations
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.920]   will likely have to wait even longer to inherit anything, all else being equal. Well, not all is
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.800]   bad news on the inheritance front. However, with the average net worth in America rising to almost
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.840]   700,000, folks, that's a lot. Don't debate me here. It's the truth. Parents are doing more than ever
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.280]   before to help their adult children thrive in adulthood. After all, baby boomers have
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.080]   benefited the most from the longest bull market in history. Every single one of my immediate
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.000]   neighbors in San Francisco has parents who have either bought them their house or are letting
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.840]   them live in one of their multiple properties rent-free. When I first moved into my house in 2014,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.000]   I met my neighbor's son, who at the time was 24 years old and a senior at UC Davis. When he
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.280]   graduated in 2015, he returned home and he still hasn't left. That's a long time, folks. Can you
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.360]   imagine relying on inheritance as a retirement strategy? You might never, ever be able to start
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   a family, create your own sense of independence, and make your great contribution to society.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.080]   Clearly, one side effect of Dyer is a surge in depression.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:23.520]   R is for retire. Forget about retiring in your 30s, 40s, 50s, or even 60s. With Dyer, we're talking
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.360]   about retiring in your 70s now, baby. We're living longer. This means we've got to work longer to
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.560]   support ourselves. Once upon a time, people would retire at around 60, 65, and then die within 5
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.040]   years. We're going to return to that phenomenon of that bygone era. The earliest one can collect
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.320]   Social Security will rise from 62 to at least 65 if the government wants to make the program whole.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   After all, the government runs a massive budget deficit every year. With little to no social
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:04.160]   safety net, achieving a comfortable retirement will all depend on you. With the trend towards
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.000]   retiring in your 70s or older, retirement life simply won't be as fun. It'll be much harder to
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.680]   play leisurely sports like golf or tennis when your back is always in pain. There'll be no way
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.200]   to ever climb the stairs of Santorini, Greece when your knees don't have cartilage. Donkey Ride it
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.280]   is. The only thing left you can do in this world of retirement is watch tons of TV and surf the
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.000]   internet. At least with the popularity of food delivery apps, you will no longer have to go out
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.160]   of the house to eat a nice rubber chicken dinner. Staying glued to a lounge chair is what the new
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:46.400]   retirement reality will be like. Finally, E is for expire. Here's where the Dyer movement will
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.840]   be at its saddest. After a long life of working because you had to, not because you wanted to,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.080]   reluctant Dyer followers will look back on their lives with regret. They will curse the day they
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.640]   ever heard about fire, because otherwise they would never have taken the leap of faith at the
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.720]   top of the market and fallen splat on their faces. Instead of being the hare, they would have won the
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   race as the tortoise, steadily saving and investing their income during their highest income earning
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   years with much less stress and worry. They wouldn't have had to embarrassingly gone back
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.680]   to work with their tails between their legs and watch old colleagues leapfrog them to now be their
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.840]   bosses. They wouldn't have had needed to go through multiple mental breakdowns and countless nights
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.800]   of self-doubt because they couldn't replace their day job income with freelance income or
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.160]   entrepreneurial income to take care of their families. Contrast reluctant Dyer followers
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:50.480]   with Dyer enthusiasts. Dyer enthusiasts see the fire movement is in trouble and decide to stay
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.920]   the course. Instead of retiring in their 30s or 40s, they decide to maximize their highest income
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.760]   earning years and retire with multiple millions of dollars in their 50s. Given everyone is living
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.800]   longer, retiring in your 50s is like retiring in your 40s of yesteryear. Of course, they also don't
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.440]   just stay miserable at their jobs. Dyer enthusiasts proactively search for better opportunities in
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.360]   order to keep on working. A Dyer enthusiast doesn't scoff at families who believe they need
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:30.880]   $5 million in an after-tax portfolio to retire early, like so many folks did. Dyer enthusiasts
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.280]   realize that runaway inflation, globalization, and structurally lower investment returns in the
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   future will wreak havoc on living the early retirement dream. Therefore, instead of getting
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:50.000]   to rage about why the world's round peg doesn't fit into their square hole, they simply logically
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.120]   adapt and work longer. So look, the Dyer movement may sound bad, but I think it's pretty good.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.320]   Unless you're willing to work more than 40 hours a week, build some side hustle income,
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.560]   generate some stable passive income, save aggressively, and continuously make shrewd
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.600]   investments for the long term, you have no chance of fire. And if you don't do all these things,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.160]   and you still decide to retire early, you will likely be screwed and join the reluctant Dyer
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.600]   camp. Yes, I know, some of you will decide to live like poppers and either delay or not have kids to
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.440]   keep expenses to a minimum to hold on to your fire dreams. More power to you, freedom is priceless.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.960]   However, for the majority of you who want to live more conventional lifestyles, it's more important
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.520]   than ever to follow some key financial principles to increase your chances for financial independence.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.400]   And if you're wise, you will embrace the realities of Dyer as the world heads south.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:55.280]   Giving priority to caring for your family and delaying a super early retirement is the responsible
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:02.000]   thing to do. Don't let fire FOMO foster irrational decision making. Early retirement is selfish,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.400]   no matter how you look at it, especially if you have dependents. Yes, if the economy gets really
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:15.280]   bad, there will be more face saving by folks who say they are fire instead of admitting they got
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.040]   laid off and are drowning in a sea of despair. Just recognize, not all is what it seems on the
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   internet or in podcast land. If your passive income cannot comfortably cover your best life's
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.200]   living expenses, if you have to drastically cut your lifestyle in order to be fire, you're not
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.920]   fire, you're just fooling yourself. It's time for the Dyer movement to rise up folks. I'm personally
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:46.160]   looking to head back to work, but I'm afraid after almost 7 years of unemployment, nobody will hire
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.560]   my Dyer self. Look, I know I sound like a Debbie Downer a little bit, talking about what it was
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:00.080]   like during the previous peak in 2007, reflecting on the 2008-2009 financial crisis, talking about
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.680]   what if you buy a property at the top of the market, you know, these things, they're not nice
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.000]   to hear. But look, you've got to listen to it. Because if you're part of the financial samurai
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.280]   community, you've got to see both sides of the equation. There is just too much damn cheerleading
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.760]   going on right now by folks who did not have enough skin in the game during the last downturn.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.560]   They have no idea folks, how bad things can get. And if things get really bad, please, please
