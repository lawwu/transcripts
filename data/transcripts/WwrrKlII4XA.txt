[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.460]   Does marijuana disrupt sleep?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.060]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.580]   And there's a pretty good amount of data on,
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.220]   so we can break sort of cannabis down
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.860]   into two of its key ingredients.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.700]   We've got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820]   And CBD is sort of the less,
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.860]   what we think of as the non-psychoactive component.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.340]   In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.260]   If you take THC, you can get high.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260]   That's the psychoactive part of the equation.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.620]   - Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense?
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.820]   - No, they're not.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.140]   Neither of them have that class right now.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.140]   THC seems to speed up the time with which you fall asleep.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.380]   But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.780]   of your falling asleep with and without that THC,
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.220]   it's not going to be an ideal fit.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700]   So you could argue it's non-natural,
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.140]   but many people use THC for that fact
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.820]   because they find it difficult to fall asleep.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.660]   And it can speed the onset of at least non-consciousness,
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.740]   I guess is the best way of describing it.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.100]   But there are problems with THC and there are twofold.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.300]   The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms,
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.140]   seems to block REM sleep.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140]   And that's why a lot of people when they're using
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.980]   will tell me, look, you know, I definitely,
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.900]   I was dreaming, I don't remember, you know,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.900]   many of my dreams.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.340]   And then when they stop using THC,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.900]   they'll say, I was having, you know,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.060]   just crazy, crazy dreams.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.580]   And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.020]   REM sleep is very clever.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.300]   And alcohol is the same way in this sense.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.220]   It's the same homeostatic mechanism.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.860]   Some people will tell me, look,
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.340]   if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.980]   you know, maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.340]   and I'll just have these really intense dreams.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.020]   So, and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.940]   Well, the way it works is that it's during
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.260]   in the middle of the night, really,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.460]   when alcohol blocks your REM sleep.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.140]   And your brain is smart.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.100]   It understands how much REM sleep you should have had,
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860]   how much REM sleep you have not
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.900]   because the alcohol has been in the system.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.980]   And finally, in those early morning hours,
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.580]   when you're getting through to sort of, you know,
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.380]   six, seven, 8 a.m. - REM like crazy.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.660]   - All of a sudden, your brain not only goes back
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.460]   to having the same amount of REM it would have had,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.060]   it does that, plus it tries to get back
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.980]   all of the REM sleep that it's lost.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.780]   Does it get back all of the REM sleep?
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.740]   No, it doesn't.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.940]   It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.980]   And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.180]   Hence, you have really intense, bizarre dreams.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.780]   And that's what happens also with THC.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.260]   You build up this pressure for REM sleep,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.140]   this debt for REM sleep.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.420]   Will you ever pay it back?
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.860]   It doesn't seem as though you get back
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.500]   everything that you lost,
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.020]   but will you get back some of it?
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.460]   Yes, the brain will start to devour more
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.740]   because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.420]   But one of the bigger problems with THC
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.060]   that we worry about is withdrawal dependency.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.380]   So as you start to use THC for sleep,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.100]   there can be a dependency tolerance.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.980]   So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.500]   And when you stop using,
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.940]   you usually get a very severe rebound insomnia.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.540]   And in fact, it's so potent
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.940]   that it's typically part of the clinical withdrawal profile
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.860]   from THC, from cannabis.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.560]   - And there's anxiety withdrawal.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.620]   I don't ask anybody to change their behavior.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.780]   We just, as you said,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.820]   we try and inform people about what the science says
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.820]   and let them make choices for themselves.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.420]   People who are regular pot smokers,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.140]   that many will insist they're not addicted.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.260]   And maybe indeed they don't actually follow
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.040]   the profile of classical addiction.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.420]   I'm guessing some do, some don't.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.500]   But if you ask them,
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.940]   well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.700]   for, I don't know, two weeks?
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.220]   That thought scares many of them.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.460]   And many of them will experience intense anxiety
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.300]   without marijuana,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.360]   which speaks to perhaps not addiction,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.580]   but a certain kind of dependency.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.220]   And again, I know many pot smokers,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.580]   some of whom have jobs that are quite high-performing
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.060]   and they manage.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.660]   - Here in Berkeley, I don't know any of those.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.060]   - Yeah, none of those, right.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.740]   What about CBD?
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.380]   I mean, we hear so much about CBD.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.780]   I've been a little concerned about the fact
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.020]   that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.640]   has confirmed that much like with melatonin,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.260]   the levels that are reported on the labels
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.700]   in no way, shape, or form match the levels
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.780]   that are actually contained in the various supplements.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.860]   Sometimes the levels are much higher
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.840]   than they're reported on the labels.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.520]   Other times it's much lower.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.420]   What does ingesting CBD do to the architecture
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.500]   and quality of sleep?
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.180]   - Right now, I don't think we have enough data
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.460]   to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.020]   I think the picture that is emerging, however,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.940]   is probably the following.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.060]   Firstly, CBD does not seem to be detrimental
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.460]   in the same ways that THC is.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.540]   So we can start by saying,
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.580]   does it create potential problems?
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.100]   Not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.060]   but the devil is a little bit in the details
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.500]   from the data that we do have,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.020]   and it comes onto your valid point of purity.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.900]   At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake-promoting.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.660]   So in lower doses, let's say sort of five or 10 milligrams,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.100]   I'm trying to remember some of the studies
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.860]   off the top of my head.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.780]   There, it actually may enhance wakefulness
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.180]   and cause problems with sleep.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.820]   It's only once you get into the higher dose range
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.820]   that there seem to have been some increases in sleepiness
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.020]   or sort of sedation-like increases.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.380]   And that's usually, I think, above about 25 milligrams,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.780]   as best I can recall from the data.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.060]   And then when we look in animal models,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.100]   you typically see the same type of profile too.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.380]   So then the question becomes,
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.060]   and now again, you just don't know about purity.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.660]   It's very difficult.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.740]   Although I think, and again, I'm not a user,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   not necessarily because I have anything against it.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.820]   It's just that's not necessarily my cup of tea.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.300]   There are some firms that are now doing
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.380]   third-party independent laboratory tests.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.420]   I don't know how gamed that is, so I've got no sense of it.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.820]   - No, I think some supplement companies
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.900]   are quite honest and accurate
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.960]   about the amounts of various substances
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.700]   that are in other products, and some are not.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.760]   And I think there's just a huge range.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.580]   I think the FDA is starting to explore CBD.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.500]   There are, certainly I saw some grant announcements
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.460]   to explore the function of CBD.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.280]   Most of the work on CBD is being done
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.660]   by the general public, ingesting it and seeing how they feel.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.340]   - Right now, if we were to,
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.140]   and I'm not making this statement,
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.820]   I don't think anyone could make the statement now,
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.740]   but if it ends up being that CBD
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.900]   is potentially beneficial for sleep,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.140]   how can we reconcile that mechanistically?
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.780]   And I think there are, to me at least,
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.860]   there are at least three candidate mechanisms
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.220]   that I've been exploring and thinking about.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.260]   The first is that it's thermoregulatory.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.340]   And what we found in some animal models
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.860]   In other words, it cools the body,
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.460]   the core body temperature down,
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.780]   and that's something that we know is good for sleep.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.900]   The second is that it's an anxiolytic,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.660]   that it can reduce anxiety.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.220]   And that data is actually quite strong,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.100]   even with some functional imaging work
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.420]   that's been coming out recently,
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.540]   showing that one epicenter of emotion
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.700]   called the amygdala deep within the brain
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.060]   is quietened down with CBD.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.340]   So I think that's at least a second non-mutually
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.340]   exclusive, you know, possibility.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.740]   I think the third is some recent data that's come out
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.900]   that was suggesting that CBD
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.780]   can alter the signaling of adenosine.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.180]   So it doesn't necessarily mean
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.140]   that you produce more adenosine,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.820]   but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.420]   perhaps, of the brain,
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.100]   so that the weight of that same adenosine
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.020]   is weightier in its brain signal,
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.060]   and therefore it creates this stronger pressure for sleep.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.860]   So I think these are all tentative mechanisms.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.540]   I think any one of them is viable.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.260]   I think all three are viable together.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.660]   But right now, I think, does that sort of help think
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.380]   through the tapestry of THC and CBD?
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380]   - Yeah, very much so.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.500]   And actually, it's a perfect segue
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   from we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC, and CBD
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.740]   as sort of, we framed them anyway,
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.420]   as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.940]   are probably okay for most people.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.980]   Certainly not for everybody.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.820]   There will be differences in sensitivity,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.940]   but that done at the incorrect times,
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.340]   and certainly in the incorrect amounts,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.900]   will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.480]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.900]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.960]   you
