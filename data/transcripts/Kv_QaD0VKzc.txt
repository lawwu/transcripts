[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   We plan to take the week of Thanksgiving off from the podcast to give you some
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.720]   time to listen to the Providence book audiobook, those excerpts that we
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.940]   published last week. I hope you will set aside time to do that. It's really
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.520]   important content. I think you'll be blessed by it. But we returned yesterday
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.320]   on Monday with a new episode on the growing debate over critical race theory.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.040]   So what exactly is it? Pastor John is about to explain in this follow-up
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.600]   episode. On Monday we looked at the relational dimensions of the debate, and
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.000]   here now is Pastor John with Critical Race Theory Part 2, The Root Problem.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.280]   So this is our second episode about critical race theory. I focused last time
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.120]   on two biblical relational principles that I so wanted to plead for, and I
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.200]   postponed a definition of what critical race theory is and the question of why
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.520]   it is so controversial and why it matters. So that's what we are about now
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   in this session. In my understanding, critical race theory is worth talking
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   about not only because it is causing divisions among Christians at points
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.880]   where I don't think those divisions need to exist, but also because in its main
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.720]   stream expression—not every use made of it, but in its main stream expression—it
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   is another manifestation of the age-old enslavement of fallen human hearts to
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.200]   self-deification—I will be my own God—self-definition—I will define my own
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.240]   essential identity and self-determination. I will decide my own
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.640]   truth and my own morality without deference to any authority outside
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.200]   myself. Now, I'm not saying that everybody who has gotten help from
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   delving into critical race theory is guilty of those things—not at all, not by
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.400]   a long shot. I'm saying these are the root problems of the mainstream,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.000]   scholarly, decades-long development of critical race theory, which is why it is
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.720]   being so hotly contested and, in that sense, rightly contested. So my most
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.760]   fundamental aim here is to encourage us all in the convictions that we are not
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   God, but Yahweh alone is God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has spoken
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.640]   truthfully in Scripture. We are not those who can define our own essential
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.720]   identity. God does that by his Word, by his creation, by his blood-bought
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.080]   transformation of his people, and we do not have ultimate self-determination. God
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.000]   decides what is true, not we. God decides what is right, not we. And if we are
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   saved from sin and for God, it will be God who saves us and not we ourselves.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.640]   Now, even more specifically, I want to establish us in these convictions over
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.720]   against the core philosophical convictions of critical race theory
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.800]   because I believe with all my heart that these convictions—not those of critical
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.680]   race theory—will serve the cause of racial harmony, racial justice, and the
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.320]   flourishing of a joyful, respectful, Christ-exalting racial and ethnic
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   diversity in the body of Christ. In other words, critical race theory is not a
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.480]   problem because it raises the challenge of racial justice and racial harmony and
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   racial respect and racial glory. Instead, it's a problem because it fails us. It
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.720]   fails us as we try to take up these challenges in a hopeful, Christ-exalting
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.240]   way. Now, what is it, and how does it manifest
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.880]   this self-deification and self-definition and self-determination? As with most
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.080]   philosophical schools of thought—and that is what we are dealing with—you can
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:07.320]   define critical race theory generically with regard to its aims, or you can define
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.760]   it more essentially with regard to its core assumptions and conclusions. If we
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.360]   stay for a moment now at the generic level, critical race theory will not
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.440]   sound controversial because it will overlap with legitimate goals and
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:33.840]   concerns of many Christians. For example, the Purdue University website defines
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.880]   critical race theory in this generic way, like this, in terms of its goals.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   "CRT"—that's short for critical race theory—"CRT scholars attempt to understand"—so you
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.880]   can hear that's a totally legitimate effort, right? We all want to understand
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.960]   things, and we ought to. "CRT scholars attempt to understand, one, how victims of
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.680]   systemic racism are affected by cultural conceptions of race, and two, how they are
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.640]   able to represent themselves to counter prejudice." Now, if you don't read more
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.720]   than you should into any of those terms, there are many Christians who would say,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:31.120]   rightly, "Well, those are my big concerns, at least some of them." So we might talk
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.360]   right past each other if we don't stop to get clarity about the meaning of
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.400]   critical race theory that we have in mind when we speak of it, either
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   sympathetically or critically. In this and many other issues, we need to take
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:55.520]   care to get our definitions clear up front in our conversations. Now, if we go
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.800]   beneath these generic goals of critical race theory to the assumptions and
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:09.200]   conclusions of its mainstream exponents, things become seriously problematic for
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:18.560]   Christians with biblical convictions because this is not a neutral theory.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:28.840]   It's laden with assumptions or viewpoints about reality that put it at odds with
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:37.240]   some biblical thinking. So let's try to get at this more essential definition of
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.400]   critical race theory. It helps us define critical race theory if we understand
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.480]   that it is an offshoot of critical theory. And what critical theory tries to
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:58.280]   do is understand society by viewing it primarily as interconnected groups which
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:05.640]   are related to each other as powerful or oppressed, advantaged or disadvantaged,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.440]   or discriminated against. It studies these groups in order to find and
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:20.960]   challenge power structures that shape the relationships between groups. Now,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.200]   that's where the word "critical" and "theory" get their meaning. It's a theory in the
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.680]   sense that it's a way of explaining how society works, and it's critical in the
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:44.320]   sense that it assesses and challenges—that is, is critical of—assesses and
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   challenges the way groups exert power or are oppressed by that power. Now, even
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.640]   though critical theory may have started with a concern about the relationships
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.680]   of privilege and oppression between classes like rich and poor, white-collar,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   blue-collar, educated, less educated, professional tradesmen, bluebloods
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   versus commoners, the theory now, as it has come into its fuller expression, has
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:26.480]   given rise to an array of focuses, theories, disciplines, studies from queer
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:35.200]   theory to fat studies. Because as soon as you focus on groups and power dynamics
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   between them, you see them everywhere, right? Women, men, heterosexual,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   homosexual, fixed-gender, transgender, old, young, Western, non-Western, American,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.240]   Canadian, able-bodied, disabled, short, tall, slender, fat. On every one of these
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:05.520]   pairs, you can find books and studies more or less shaped by critical theory, a
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:13.200]   focus on the identity of the group and a challenge of the power or the privilege
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:23.000]   of one group over another. So critical race theory—so add the word "race" to the
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.440]   term "critical theory." Critical race theory, then, tries to understand and
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.680]   challenge, deal critically with, the power and oppression relationships that have
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:46.880]   marked racial groups historically and still do today. Now, it's true that a
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.720]   focus on groups while minimizing the individual and a focus on power while
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:00.040]   minimizing other relational dynamics like love and humility and graciousness
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:09.000]   can skew our understanding and yield unhelpful strategies. Yes, that's true.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.360]   Nevertheless, those very focuses, misleading as they might be, can also
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:26.320]   reveal insights that may be strategically helpful in moving toward greater justice.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:34.120]   So what's the root problem? To dig down to what I think is the root problem of
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:41.680]   critical race theory in mainstream scholarly expression, I had to probe
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:50.120]   behind a few controversial statements which were at first baffling to me and
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:58.720]   then became revealing. Let me quote two of these statements and then describe my
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:05.560]   probing to the root issue. These are quotes from mainstream critical race
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:14.400]   theory or its proponents in Christian circles. Number one, "We cannot be
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.800]   anti-racist if we are homophobic or transphobic." Here's the
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.120]   second statement, and this time from a Christian conference moving in step with
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:37.480]   mainstream critical race theory, "Biblical inerrancy and infallibility
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:46.440]   are orthodoxies of white supremacist thought." Now my guess is that
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.720]   most of you hearing this are bamboozled by those two statements. What?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:01.680]   How did they get there? That has been the most illuminating question for me. How
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.600]   did they get there? So let's take those statements one at a time and ask that
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.480]   question because it gets us to the root of the issue. So here's the first one.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   "We cannot be anti-racist if we are homophobic or transphobic." Let's make sure that we
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   are clear here about what mainstream critical race theorists mean by
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:38.160]   homophobic and transphobic. They don't just mean the fear and hatred of people
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.440]   who try to change their sex or people who have sexual desires for people of
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:55.080]   the same sex. They mean homophobia, transphobia includes the Christian view
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.840]   that homosexual behavior is sinful and that trying to change your God-given sex
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:09.040]   is sinful. So what they're trying to say then is this. You, you John Piper, or you
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:17.000]   Evangelical, you can't hold these historic Christian convictions and be
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   anti-racist. So the question is, why not? Or how did they arrive at that
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.520]   conclusion? And here's my answer, and it's my deepest problem with critical race
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:40.160]   theory. They arrive at this conclusion because at root they believe a person's
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:49.040]   essential identity is self-chosen, self-constructed, not God-designed or
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.240]   God-given. Or another way to say it would be that when it comes to our own
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:04.720]   identity, we are our own God. We do not acknowledge or submit to any divine
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:14.160]   truth or morality or theory as above us constraining or limiting our own
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:21.240]   self-definition, our own self-construction. So if I choose to be a
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:30.000]   woman, though God made me a man, I am right to do so. No God, no morality, no
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.880]   religion, no ideology can replace me as the self-determining, self-defining,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:45.720]   self-deifying sovereign of my own identity. Now you may be asking, as I did,
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:54.360]   "Well, how does that explain the statement we cannot be anti-racist if we are
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.680]   homophobic or transphobic?" And I think the answer from critical race theory
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.160]   would be something like this. When you say, Piper, let's just say Piper, when you
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:13.800]   say, John Piper, that a person is wrong to claim to be a woman if he was born a
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:21.400]   man, and when you say that it's wrong for people to act on their homosexual
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:30.200]   desires, you, Piper, are wielding ideological power to oppress two groups
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.360]   of people who have freely and rightly chosen their identity. Call it what you
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:44.960]   will, you are exerting your supremacy to marginalize a vulnerable group. And the
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:55.400]   reason people like you, Piper, who do that can't be anti-racist is because the
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   same position of ideological supremacy from which you presume to denounce and
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.280]   marginalize a transgender person or a sexually active homosexual person is in
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.240]   essence the same position of power and privilege and supremacy from which you
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:22.680]   will justify your superiority as a dominant race over others. When God is
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.080]   out of the picture, what's left to determine right and wrong and what our
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:38.600]   true identity is, what's left is personal autonomy, self-definition,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:46.520]   self-determination, self-construction. And if a person like me, say, rejects such
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:54.320]   personal autonomy as the final arbiter of right and wrong, well, within the
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:03.960]   framework of God-evicting critical race theory, the only explanation left for my
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:10.560]   behavior, John Piper's behavior, is your own will to power, Piper. That's all
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.520]   that's left. If you reject autonomy and God is not in the picture and a Bible is
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.920]   not in the picture, there's one thing left, and we know you're guilty of it—
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:28.320]   will to power. Therefore, if you reveal your rejection—you, Piper—if you reveal
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:35.400]   your rejection of human autonomy, self-determination, self-definition in
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   regard to homosexual behavior or sex-changing, you show yourself guilty of
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.400]   governing all your relationships by a will to power rather than a respect for
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.920]   autonomy, for those are the only two options left where God and his Word are
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:04.160]   out of the picture, which leads, as you can see, directly to the roots of the
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.960]   second baffling statement, namely, "Biblical inerrancy and infallibility
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:17.120]   are orthodoxies of white supremacist thought." Now, why would a person say that?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.800]   What's the root issue behind that statement? The root issue is that the
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:32.200]   claim to have an infallible Bible undermines the fundamental assumption of
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.960]   critical race theory in its mainline expression, and that fundamental
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:45.600]   assumption is that human identity is self-constructed, not God-given. Any group,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:54.200]   therefore, that claims to have access to an infallible Word of God that dictates
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:02.320]   human identity and human right and wrong is a manifest threat to human autonomy
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   and, within the frame of reference of critical race theory, can only be
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.280]   understood as a group trying to seize power, in this case white power, since
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.080]   most of the confessions of faith in the history of the church that espouse
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.880]   biblical infallibility have been written by white men. So, in conclusion and
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:38.680]   summary, critical race theory in its generic definition as a quest for
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:44.160]   understanding the history of oppression in race relations and the present
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.800]   attitudes and structures that continue that oppression is a worthy quest. And
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.920]   critical race theory in its more essential definition, including its
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.200]   mainstream assumptions and conclusions, is a manifestation of the age-old
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:14.360]   enslavement of the fallen human heart to self-deification—I will be my own God—and
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:23.600]   self-definition—I will define my own essential identity—and self-determination—I
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:30.160]   will decide my own truth, my own morality, without reference or deference to any
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   authority outside myself. And therefore, to try to make progress in racial justice
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:46.320]   and racial respect and racial harmony by absorbing the assumptions and categories
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.720]   and conclusions and strategies of critical race theory is a dead-end
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:02.200]   street. Or, as I said earlier, critical race theory is not a problem because it
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.880]   raises the challenge of racial justice and racial harmony and racial respect
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:18.680]   and racial glory. It's a problem because it fails us. It fails us as we try to
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:26.640]   take up these challenges in a hopeful, Christ-exalting way. Inside critical race
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:35.760]   theory, God is small and negligible. Inside critical race theory, the Bible is
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:45.960]   small and negligible. Truth is small and negligible. And evil is big. And there's
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:56.920]   no answer for it—none. It's a hopeless path—tragically hopeless. But inside that
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:08.240]   infallible Word called the Bible, there is an absolutely explosive redemption and
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:16.720]   blood-bought reconciliation and Christ-exalting harmony. And the failures
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:24.120]   of the church historically and today cannot cancel it. It is there. And if we
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:32.040]   would be more saturated by God's Word and more broken and humble and submitted
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.840]   to that Word in all of its radical ramifications, there would be hope. Oh,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:47.120]   there is hope. And that's my prayer. A lot rides on this. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.680]   And with that, we will see you on Monday for another all-new APJ episode. Can I
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.800]   speak my destiny true? A lot of TV preachers say that you can if you have
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.720]   enough faith. Speak your destiny true. Name it and claim it. Pastor John will
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.160]   respond and help us better understand the open promise of Jesus in John chapter
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.320]   15 and verse 7. I'm Tony Reinke. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving break, and we will
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.480]   see you back here on Monday.
