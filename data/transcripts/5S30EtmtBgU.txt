[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.680]   Okay, we have 10 times as many questions
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.520]   as we're gonna get to.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.860]   I want you guys to be aware of that from the beginning.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.640]   But the good news is this is day one.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.180]   None of these guys are going anywhere.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.780]   So hunt them down over the next few days
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.380]   and we'll try to get everything answered as we can.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.160]   All right, let's get started.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.960]   Define market timing.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   I reduced my bond duration prior to
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.600]   the Federal Open Market Committee raising rates.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.440]   Is that market timing?
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.080]   Should I buy long bonds now and wait for rates to go down?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.220]   If market timing doesn't work,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.120]   how does prime cap and capital opportunity beat the market?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   Anyone wanna volunteer for that one?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.700]   Yes, that is market timing.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.080]   And this is one of the problems that we all,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.840]   most of us don't believe in market timing,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.120]   but we use it and that's a hard one
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.640]   because market timing can be systematic
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.020]   by some sort of following a trend,
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.420]   following line of some sort.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.420]   Or it can be what we call the ICSIA market timing system.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.100]   I can't stand it anymore.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.400]   And the moment it becomes an emotional decision,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.560]   remembering there's always a pile of good news
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.440]   about any trade and a pile of bad news.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.920]   And so as a market timer,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.940]   you're fighting trying to figure out which is more powerful.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.640]   So I'm not an advocate of it,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   although half of my portfolio is market time.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.680]   - You're gonna have an allocation between
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.400]   stocks, bonds, cash, real estate,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.040]   and you're gonna stick with that.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.120]   And if you're supposed to rebalance, you rebalance.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.600]   And if you deviate from that
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   because you see something out there in the economy
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.520]   or interest rates of the Fed or China
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   or Middle East or whatever,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.080]   and you're gonna make these decisions saying,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.280]   I don't like what I see out there,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.960]   I'm gonna change my asset allocation in some way,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   that's market timing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.680]   - Okay, let's do the next question.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200]   We're gonna do this one rapid fire.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.560]   We're gonna go across the stage.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   We'll start with me and go across.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.860]   Here's the question.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.640]   If you got a kid with a Roth IRA,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.460]   should they be putting it in a target retirement fund
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.460]   or a total stock market index fund?
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.400]   - Yeah, so generally Roth money, from what I've seen,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.180]   is the last money that anybody ever spends.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.300]   It generally goes to the kids
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.140]   because it goes to them tax-free.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.160]   And then they have 10 years
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220]   of which to distribute the money tax-free.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.860]   So it's generally 100% equity.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.860]   - This may sound like a commercial.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.420]   One of those three free books,
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.180]   two of those three free books
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.140]   are focused on target date funds.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.340]   And what we do recommend is you look at the implications
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.340]   of a target date fund and 10% small cap value.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.540]   - I will say that if you're going to do small cap value
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940]   and you actually believe the premium
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.660]   is actually gonna happen,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.900]   that putting it in a Roth is not a bad idea.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.620]   - I would say, woo, all stock portfolio
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.300]   because it's probably going to be an addendum
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.940]   to their own retirement account,
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340]   which is probably in a target date fund anyway.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.080]   - Yeah, I'm pretty much agreeing.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.060]   The whole issue of asset location
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.860]   would suggest that with the Roth,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.740]   that would be where the stocks
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.300]   and the small cap value, if you're gonna have it,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.540]   would be best positioned.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.580]   - Is mine on?
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.940]   - Nothing different here, total stock market index.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.020]   You said it was for the child, right?
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.260]   Like an 18 year old.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.100]   Yeah, absolutely, I'd go 100% stocks.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.020]   - I'm the different voice up here, apparently.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.980]   My kids are in target retirement funds.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.820]   And I'll tell you the reason why.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.900]   - Come see me afterwards.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.540]   - I'll tell you the reason why.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.340]   I'm managing about 50 investment accounts,
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.180]   between 34 529s for nieces and nephews,
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.500]   between our own retirement accounts,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.420]   between my kids, we each have three accounts.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.300]   It's a lot of accounts.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.780]   So I'm looking for simple solutions.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.380]   And the benefit of a target retirement account
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.660]   is I get a simple solution.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.920]   And when they inherit it, they will have a simple solution.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.980]   If they forget about it for 20 years, it's fine.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.100]   They've got US stocks, they've got international stocks,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.180]   they've got a very tiny amount of bonds.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.500]   You really think total stock market's
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.540]   gonna dramatically outperform a portfolio
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.300]   that's 90% stocks?
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   No, probably not.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.060]   So that's why I chose it.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.940]   It's one of those questions,
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.900]   probably doesn't matter that much, to be honest.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.980]   Okay, next question.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.740]   This one's from Mary Beth Franklin.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.580]   Is there a reason one of us should not wait
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.380]   until presumably 70 to collect Social Security benefits?
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.980]   I agree for married couples
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.620]   that splitting the difference, you're hedging your bets.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.820]   Have the one with the bigger benefit wait 'til 70,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.860]   have the other spouse, if he or she's not working,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.260]   claim early at 62, bring cash into the household.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.420]   If they are working and subject to earnings restrictions,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.180]   wait 'til full retirement age.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.020]   Okay, here's a more controversial question.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.220]   What's the amount of cash or cash equivalent
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.120]   one should have on hand in retirement?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.300]   Recommendations are all over the map.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.140]   - Well, you do wanna have some sort of
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.300]   liquid contingency fund, and whether that's cash
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.740]   or whether that's some other buffer asset,
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.620]   something, it's hard to give a specific recommendation.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.260]   Usually you hear like six months,
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.260]   something along those lines,
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.420]   but can't really get any more specific than that.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.580]   You definitely do need something.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.660]   - I'm gonna say the amount that lets you sleep at night,
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.420]   and so I've seen those numbers be all over the place.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.340]   For high-income spenders, I've seen people
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.700]   that need to have $200,000 in cash set on the side,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.420]   it's just what makes them feel comfortable,
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.860]   and people that are comfortable with 10,000,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.940]   as long as they have their defined paycheck coming in.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.060]   - My wife and I, at the first of each year,
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.060]   we take out 5% of whatever we have for retirement,
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.140]   and that's our money for the year.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.100]   But on the other hand, the retirement,
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.820]   the buy and hold part is 50% bonds and 50% stocks,
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.960]   and a lot of the bonds are short-term.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760]   So they aren't cash, but they are the same as cash,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   and so I think that you should, when you can,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.880]   keep that cash working at something better
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.800]   than the return for cash.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.680]   - Yeah, so there's a difference
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560]   between philosophy and strategy, right?
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.840]   Philosophy, we're all bogleheads,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   we all believe you should have some sort of an emergency fund.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.040]   I don't like to call it an emergency fund.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.520]   I like to call it a reserve fund,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.200]   because emergency fund is too, I don't know,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.480]   dramatic for me.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.860]   So how much should you have?
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.600]   This is strategy, which means strategy is individual.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.920]   I don't know how much you should have.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.120]   I mean, it all depends on you.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.160]   What's your situation?
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.200]   How much cash do you need?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   I mean, are you doing RMDs?
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.760]   I mean, a hundred different things.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.560]   Are you covered, are your expenses covered
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.020]   by Social Security and maybe a pension of some sort?
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.320]   Do you need to have a lot of cash?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.160]   Or maybe you wanna spend a lot of cash.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.840]   So strategy is individual.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.940]   And how much you have in a reserve fund
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.460]   when you're retired is really an individual decision.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.760]   I don't think there's any rule of thumb
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.220]   that can cover that.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.520]   - I like the idea of years,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.120]   because if you have a year like 2022
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.680]   when stocks and bonds are down,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.240]   well, you withdraw from the cash.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.860]   So I like the idea of having two or three years worth,
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.060]   but there's obviously a cash drag to that.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.560]   All right, next question, cybersecurity.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.360]   Any quick questions to reduce the risk
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.600]   of financial accounts being compromised by cyber criminals,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.440]   i.e. multi-factor authentication,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   diversifying among multiple companies or accounts, et cetera.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.800]   - I'll tackle that one
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.200]   because we have to deal with those regulations.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.720]   I mean, anything that has multi-factor, I would turn it on.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.040]   So if you can have a, where it sends a text message
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.560]   and you have to put that code in,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.380]   or a Google authenticator app
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.760]   that you can add to the account.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.460]   So you have to put a six digit code in
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.020]   every time you log in.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.440]   I think that's the most effective thing
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.160]   and really educating yourself on what not to click on.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.920]   And so we had an employee for a while who would click on,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.680]   I mean, he could fall for every email that came in
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.280]   that you shouldn't click on.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.160]   And so, understanding that, just don't click on stuff.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.400]   You would never put your account number in
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.700]   from a link that you would click on in an email.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.800]   You would always go directly to that website to log in.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.640]   So educating yourself is one of the biggest ways
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.600]   you can prevent those things from happening.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.960]   - Is it okay to have all your money at Vanguard?
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.440]   - Say yes.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.880]   - Anybody disagree with that?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.620]   All right, next question.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.080]   Let's start with you on this, Wade.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.840]   And if anybody else wants to weigh in, they can.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.040]   How do you balance conversions
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160]   from your IRA to your Roth account
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440]   with Medicare increasing due to tax increase
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   from additional income in that year?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:45.800]   - That question probably came in before the session,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.300]   but indeed, you definitely want to be paying attention
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.800]   to those IRMA brackets.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.820]   And then I didn't really get a chance to elaborate
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.480]   on the assumptions.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.640]   I was basing it on this year's IRMA brackets,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.320]   even though the tax won't come until two years later.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.280]   But the issue is you don't know
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.120]   what those brackets will be two years later.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.640]   So I treat it as a conservative assumption
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.440]   that if I stay under this year's brackets,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.040]   and then there's a little bit spare capacity
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.440]   where if the last day of the year markets went up
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.160]   and then my RMD is a little bit higher than expected,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.240]   I still, hopefully the brackets will be higher
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.600]   two years later.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.200]   But I try to manage based on this year's brackets.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.080]   If you don't want to go over that bracket,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.500]   make sure you're not getting too close.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.300]   And if you're in the RMD phase,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.620]   pay attention at the end of the year
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.140]   because you don't know what your RMD is gonna be
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.260]   for the next year until December 31st, the market closes.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.660]   - Rick?
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.580]   - I would also agree with that
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.160]   because you know the IRMA brackets
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.660]   are now gonna go up every year.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.460]   So if you use the current ones,
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.780]   you're gonna be on the safe side
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.220]   and you'll have a little more wiggle room.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.060]   - Pass that down to Rick.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.420]   He's got a comment on this.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.700]   - I'm just gonna give a shout out to Stephen Chin
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.060]   if you're here and newretirement.com.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.300]   Good software, good software
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.740]   for helping figure this stuff out.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.620]   It does, very inexpensive.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.920]   You just sign up for a subscription.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.980]   It's really good to help you.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.460]   Gives you data points, gives you more information.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.420]   So just a shout out to Steve, did a good job on that
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.240]   and newretirement.com.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.180]   - Herbert Franklin, this one's for you probably.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.900]   And this is kind of the counter argument to wait 'til 70.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.420]   Are social security benefits payments actuarially adjusted?
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.200]   Is there really a benefit to waiting 'til 70?
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.060]   - Well, social security benefits are actuarially fair
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.500]   if you live 'til average life expectancy.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.200]   And you do get this bonus
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.960]   of these delayed retirement credits of 8% a year.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.300]   Back before the social security reforms,
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.940]   those delayed retirement credits were 3% a year.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.820]   No one in their right mind delayed going to 70
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.040]   because at the time, interest rates were 18%.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.020]   So when they came up with the concept of,
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.480]   hey, let's make the delayed retirement credits
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.180]   gradually increase to 8% a year, it's a huge bonus.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.080]   If you can afford to wait, it really is worth it.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.780]   - And just to add to that,
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.740]   to those actuarial calculations were done in 1983
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.580]   and people are living longer now.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.060]   And also with the high earner,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.620]   where that benefit will last
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.900]   for the joint lifetime of the couple,
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.180]   that's a different calculation.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.380]   The actuarial calculations from social security
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.820]   were based on single people.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.100]   - Okay, next one's a question for me.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.860]   How much in rental properties is too much
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.620]   as a percentage of net worth?
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.420]   I think a reasonable amount of money to have
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.420]   in real estate is zero to 80%.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.220]   So it's a very wide range.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.900]   If you're more than 80, I think that's too much.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.220]   And the second part of the question is,
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.980]   can real estate risk be diversified away
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.940]   by buying properties in multiple regions?
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.620]   You can diversify away some of your risk by doing that,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.740]   but certainly not all of your real estate risk.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.220]   All the real estate in the country
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.380]   and in the world can tank at the same time.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.420]   All right, this one's for Wade Pfau.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.020]   How can I make a tax map?
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.420]   - Well, it can be done in Excel spreadsheets.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.260]   The preferential income part isn't too rough.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.660]   The IRMA brackets are pretty straightforward.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.220]   You're gonna have to spend the most time
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.060]   getting those social security tax torpedoes under control
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.380]   'cause it is a multi-step calculation.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.740]   But you can ultimately do that in Excel
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.860]   where you're just looking at,
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.180]   okay, here's the ordinary income column,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.300]   and then you have to keep track,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.740]   not just of the federal income tax brackets,
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.580]   but when the IRMA surcharges happen,
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.020]   the stacking of preferential income on top of that.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.800]   And the hardest part, for sure, the social security,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.460]   the percent of your social security benefits
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460]   that would be taxed.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.540]   - There is software you can use
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.740]   that advisors subscribe to.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.820]   I don't see why you couldn't subscribe to it either.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.700]   We use HolistaPlan.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.860]   There's also another one by Covissium.
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.980]   And so, I just don't know if it's gonna be cost-effective,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.440]   but you can run your own tax projections.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.300]   And HolistaPlan does an outstanding tax map.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.180]   - And the tax map idea, yeah, Covissum,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.280]   that's the one that's,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.760]   what I'm doing is the most similar to.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.880]   - Okay, we're gonna do about two more questions here,
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.700]   'cause I know we're just slightly over time.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.480]   This one, how is social security claiming strategy
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.880]   affected by possible future insolvency of the trust fund?
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.580]   Let's just do a show of hands on this one.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.880]   How many people on stage think that
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.600]   there will be no social security payments
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.240]   being made in 10 or 15 years?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.600]   Okay, I think that answers that question.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.880]   How about, how many people on the stage
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.320]   think that the benefits may be a little bit lower
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.980]   than what people were expecting?
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.640]   - Depending on the generation.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.360]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.000]   All right, and let's do this one here.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.720]   - Can I just say something really quickly?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.560]   - Sure.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.920]   - We can only act under current law.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.800]   We don't know what Congress is gonna do.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.400]   If you need the money, grab it early,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.960]   and you know it's gonna be reduced.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.040]   But if you are taking a benefit early
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.020]   out of fear of what might happen 10 years from now,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.480]   that is like selling your stocks in a down market.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.640]   And we all know that no one in this room
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.800]   cashes out when the mark goes down.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.580]   All you do is guarantee that you have locked in a loss.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.320]   - Okay, and we're gonna end on this one.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.540]   If I can read it here.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.440]   Is this the time for a around 70-ish year old couple
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.320]   getting Social Security at seven
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.040]   to consider seriously buying a deferred income annuity
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.220]   with our bond funds?
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:52.800]   - Yeah, I wanna get back to philosophy,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.760]   strategy, discipline, the three key things
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.680]   that make you successful.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.960]   The Boglehead's philosophy is not against annuities.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.540]   Whether it works for you when you're a strategy or not
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.400]   is really unique to your situation.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   So I actually can't answer that question
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.420]   unless I knew the whole situation.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.040]   - Go ahead, Dana.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.480]   - We use something we call a coverage ratio.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.200]   So we look at how much of your cash flow
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.500]   is covered by guaranteed sources of income already.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.780]   And if that's under 50%,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.680]   it's when we bring up a discussion
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   around do you want additional guaranteed income?
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.180]   Is that important to you?
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.400]   And so that could be one metric that you could look at.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.680]   I completely agree with what Rick said, right?
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.820]   It's so personal.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.840]   The other issue is cognitive decline.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.040]   So we have seen strange things.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.840]   Once we had the spouse of a client
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.800]   who was ordering things off of QVC
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.080]   and burying them in her backyard.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   And it took the husband months to figure out where,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.280]   it was like $3,000 to $4,000 a month,
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.080]   months to figure out where was this extra money going.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.200]   And so, you know, a deferred income annuity
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.560]   could protect you against yourself.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.020]   And I know that sounds like a strange thing to say,
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.320]   but it is absolutely guaranteed.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.400]   And if the older you was prone to falling
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.540]   for investment fraud or making some strange decisions,
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.520]   it does offer some additional protection.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.220]   And I don't hear that talked about all that often.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.240]   - And as a preview for tomorrow,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   Jim and I will have a session together
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.440]   where we'll be able to unpack that some more too.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.320]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.680]   Annuities can be very useful,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.720]   particularly those that barely have enough
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   or almost have enough.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.080]   That can be a great way to fill that gap.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.920]   All right.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.080]   Well, this has been Bogleheads University.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.040]   This is not supposed to be part of the conference,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.960]   even though you all showed up a day early and came to it.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.320]   So thank you for your attendance.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.000]   Thank you to these wonderful people
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.520]   who out of the goodness of their heart.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   (audience cheering)
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.560]   Came out here for the most part at their own expense.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.080]   Most of us are paying our own conference fee as well,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.280]   just like you are,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.780]   and are just here out of the goodness of our hearts
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.680]   to share this information with you.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.760]   Thank you to you guys.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.600]   That's been wonderful.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.520]   Thanks to everyone for coming.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.640]   The party starts at five.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.960]   It's in the room next door.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.900]   It's cocktail hour.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.000]   That's the traditional start to the Bogleheads conference,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.900]   but it's been wonderful to share the afternoon with you.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.760]   And thank you everyone for showing up early.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.340]   (audience cheering)
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
