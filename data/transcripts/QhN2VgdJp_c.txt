[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   George Whitefield was born in the city of Gloucester on December the 16th, 1714.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.960]   Not in a bishop's palace, not in a clergyman's rectory, but in the Bell Inn.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.780]   The old inn, unfortunately, has been demolished by now, but it was very similar to this new
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.200]   inn in which we are now standing, which was contemporary with it.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.960]   His father died while he was quite a boy, but his mother continued to keep the inn,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.080]   and there he would serve beer and various other drinks.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.800]   He was characterised from the beginning by a kind of lovable character, and also by his
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.560]   sharpness, his intelligence, but above all by his gift of speech and of oratory.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.680]   His clear diction and elocution were quite outstanding.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.400]   He could declaim Shakespeare and he'd take part in plays in school.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   At 18, on a borrowed ten pounds, he went up to Pembroke College, Oxford.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.400]   In exchange for free tuition, he served as a lackey to other more highly placed students.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   But his residence here was to be the great turning point of his life.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.600]   This was the result of his meeting with Charles Wesley, who introduced him to the meetings
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.900]   of the so-called Holy Club.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.400]   This was a club that met regularly in the rooms of John Wesley in Lincoln College on
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.060]   the first floor.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.000]   The members of the club met together to encourage one another in the living of a holy life.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.800]   They used to visit regularly the Oxford prison and speak to and exhort the prisoners.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.000]   They would pray together, they read books together, but above all they encouraged one
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.380]   another in good works.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.560]   They would visit the poor and give them gifts.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.200]   In addition to this, they fasted twice a week and sometimes even more.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.960]   Whitfield tells us that at one period he fasted so rigorously that he could scarcely drag
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.280]   himself up the stairs.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.360]   However, he and the Wesley brothers came to see subsequently that this was all wrong,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.520]   that they were trying to justify themselves by works and good deeds.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.720]   Then having read a book called The Life of God in the Soul of Men by Henry Schuyl, he
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.280]   realized that true Christianity was something in the heart and that he needed a new nature.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.640]   He realized he'd never been a Christian at all, so now he sought this with tears and
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.000]   prayers.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.120]   And eventually he was given a sense that his sins were forgiven.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.640]   Indeed, this was even "sailed" to him, as he put it, by the Holy Spirit in his heart.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.440]   On returning to Gloucester at the age of 21, he was ordained in the cathedral by Bishop
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   Benson, writing in his journal, "I have thrown myself this day, blindfold, into God's mighty
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   hands."
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   A week later, Whitfield preached his first sermon in public here in the church of St.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.640]   Mary de Cript.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.780]   Perhaps we can do nothing better than read a letter which he himself wrote describing
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.360]   the occasion to a friend.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.320]   He said, "Curiosity drew a large congregation together.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.720]   The sight at first a little awed me, but I was comforted with a heartfelt sense of the
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.160]   divine presence and soon found an unspeakable advantage of having been accustomed to public
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.120]   speaking as a boy at school and of exhorting and teaching the prisoners while at the university.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.760]   As I progressed, I perceived a fire kindled, till at last, though so young and amidst a
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.480]   crowd who knew me in my childish days, I trust I was enabled to speak with some degree of
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.240]   gospel authority.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.880]   And I have since heard that a complaint has been made to the bishop that I drove 15 mad.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.200]   Indeed, such a complaint was made, but the wise old bishop, Bishop Benson, simply replied
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.500]   by saying that he wished and hoped very much that the madness would not be forgotten before
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.280]   the following Sunday."
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.040]   He was not prepossessing to look at.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.840]   As the result of Andas' neglect during the measles, he had a cast in his left eye, which
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.640]   later gained him the nickname Dr. Squintum.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   But it also had the curious effect of making everyone believe that the preacher's eye was
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.840]   upon him and could not be escaped.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:41.240]   In the next 34 and a half years, he is estimated to have preached about 18,000 sermons.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.280]   When Whitfield returned from America at the end of 1738, he found a great change in the
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.320]   attitude of the churches to him.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.120]   No longer was he received with open arms as he'd been in 1737.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.080]   The pulpits were closed to him.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.420]   This presented him with a problem.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.840]   In addition to that, he had become struck by the need of people like the benighted Colliers
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.560]   in the Kingswood district outside Bristol.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.800]   They were living in debauchery and sin, and no one went to preach to them, and they wouldn't
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.080]   enter the churches.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.560]   What could he do?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.660]   So in February 1739, he took one of the greatest decisions of his whole life.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.360]   It affected his entire future and that of the whole Methodist revival.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   He decided that he must take the gospel to the people.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.640]   So here on Hannah Mount at Kingswood outside Bristol, he first preached the gospel of Jesus
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   Christ in the open air.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.100]   So Whitfield took his stand in this very spot and began to preach to this strange congregation.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.580]   He took as his text the first three verses of the fifth chapter of Matthew's gospel,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.740]   a part of our Lord's Sermon on the Mount preached in the open air.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740]   At first, he had a congregation of some 200.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.780]   It soon swelled to 2,000 and eventually to 20,000.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.460]   Whitfield comments as follows on the response of his congregation.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.500]   The first discovery of their being affected was to see the white cutters made by their
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.420]   tears which plentifully fell down their black cheeks as they came out of the culpits.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.460]   At the end of this incident, Whitfield wrote in his journal, "I believe I never was more
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:44.300]   acceptable to my master than when I was standing to teach those hearers in the open air."
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.740]   Returning to London in April, Whitfield found all the churches close to him apart from St.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.300]   Mary's Parish Church in Islington.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.180]   He went there one Friday with the intention of preaching, but just as he was about to
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.740]   enter the pulpit, the church warden questioned his title.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.820]   Rather than create a scene, Whitfield decided to go out and preach in the church yard.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.700]   The congregation followed him and others joined them.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.520]   This was the real beginning of his open air preaching in London.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.860]   He wrote in his journal that night, "Since the self-righteous men of this generation
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.660]   count themselves unworthy, I go out to the highways and hedges and compel harlots, publicans,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.780]   and sinners to come in that my master's house may be filled."
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.260]   Another favorite spot of Whitfield's for this field preaching was Minchin-Hampton Common
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.160]   in Gloucestershire, where from this very spot, which is still known as Whitfield's Tump,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.180]   he preached many times to vast congregations of 20,000 or 30,000 people.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.960]   Some have queried this as to whether it was possible, but there are contemporary records
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.380]   which assure us that people in Stroud, which is about a mile distant, could frequently
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.940]   hear him quite distinctly when he preached here.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.940]   He visited Wales many times, and in 1743, he was elected as the first moderator of the
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.460]   Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Connection.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.460]   The scenes when he visited Scotland baffled description.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.300]   They were nothing less than a return to the first days of the early church.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.520]   Churches were added to the churches of all denominations and in all these countries.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.280]   His influence was almost as great in America as in this country.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.000]   Some of his greatest services were held in Philadelphia, where he preached to vast congregations.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.420]   Eventually, a chapel was built for him there, and it is interesting that this became the
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.340]   first building of the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.620]   Stroud had not founded a denomination, and he was not an organizer like his friend John
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   Wesley.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   The nearest he came to founding a cause was that he cooperated with the Countess of Huntingdon
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:07.660]   in building chapels, which were known as tabernacles in various parts of the country.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:14.100]   We have here, in what is known as the Rodborough Tabernacle, a perfect example of one of these
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   chapels that were built by the Countess of Huntingdon.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.260]   The mention of the name of Lady Huntingdon reminds us of another most important point
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.940]   concerning George Whitefield and his preaching.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.740]   Some would get the impression that he was just a mob orator who appealed to drunken
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.420]   miners, but this was far from being the case.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.700]   He was equally popular with the gentry and the great in the land.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.700]   Take for instance the well-known actor David Garrick.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:50.660]   Garrick said he could melt an audience from euphoric joy to tears merely by saying and
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.420]   pronouncing the word Mesopotamia in different ways.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.700]   Garrick also said that he would willingly part with a hundred guineas if he could only
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:06.300]   say the word "Oh" with the same pathos and effect as Whitefield.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.680]   The great Lord Chesterfield frequently listened to the preaching in the home of the Countess
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.940]   of Huntingdon, and the story goes that on one occasion Whitefield was using a great
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.180]   illustration to warn sinners of their peril in time and in eternity.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.220]   And it was a story of a blind beggar with a dog walking near the edge of a cliff leading
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.460]   to a great precipice.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:39.060]   And Whitefield was describing this man and how suddenly the dog left him and there was
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.540]   the poor man stumbling along and not knowing where he was going and drawing nearer and
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.900]   nearer and nearer to the edge of the precipice and in danger of falling to destruction at
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.900]   any moment.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.060]   And he kept this up for such a length of time and increased the tension to such an extent
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.580]   that Chesterfield was completely carried away and falling on his face to the floor cried
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.880]   out saying, "Good God, he's gone!"
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.520]   Such was the moving eloquence of this man.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.940]   We have here an authentic relic of Whitefield.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.020]   It's known as Whitefield's stick.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:24.220]   Still more interesting and important is this chair in this Robert O'Connett Hall.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.340]   And on this there are a few lines written by one of the early ministers which read like
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   this.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:37.080]   "If love of soul should e'er be wanting here, remember me, for I am Whitefield's chair.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:44.120]   I bore his weight and witness to his fears, his earnest prayers, his interesting tears.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.480]   This holy man was filled with love divine.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.600]   Art thou the same?
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.520]   Sit down and call me thine."
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:01.160]   On September the 29th, 1770, at the age of 56, he preached his last sermon at a place
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.200]   called Exeter in New England.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.720]   Though extremely weak at the beginning, he preached for two hours.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.280]   We end our program here in London in Tottenham Court Road where one of his tabernacles was
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.160]   erected.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.360]   That is the explanation of this remarkable story of this apostolic and seraphic ministry.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.120]   It was certainly not advertising and organization.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.320]   It was not even his amazing eloquence and his indefatigable zeal, though they contributed.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.600]   He himself would have said that it was largely the message.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.200]   What was the message?
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.100]   It was the old message of the New Testament of the Protestant fathers and the Puritans.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.480]   It was a declaration that we are all dead in trespasses and sins and under the wrath
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.280]   of God, that we are to be called to repentance.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.360]   It was an emphasis on the absolute necessity of a new birth in the spirit.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.640]   The ultimate explanation of Whitefield is the extraordinary unction and anointing of
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.720]   the Holy Spirit that attended his preaching.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.560]   He himself was always conscious of this and always stressed that one should always preach
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.640]   a felt Christ.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:26.380]   To use the words of the Apostle Paul, Whitefield's gospel came to the people not in word only,
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:32.780]   but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and with much assurance.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.840]   Has this anything to say to us today?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.760]   Surely it has.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:46.420]   Our men and the world are still the same as they were at the beginning of the 18th century.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.560]   Still more important, Whitefield's God is still the same.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:14:01.840]   We honor his memory best of all by seeking with diligence that same God sought by him
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.360]   and his friends and contemporaries.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.020]   (air whooshing)
