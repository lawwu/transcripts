[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.280]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.720]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880]   I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.760]   So imagine this, you're a smart kid, your family prioritizes education, you study
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.720]   hard, and you decide you want to become a doctor.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.040]   You ace your exams, you're admitted to one of the top medical schools in the
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.720]   world, you complete the program, and you start work.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   And then a few years later, you decide to leave it all behind to focus on something
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.000]   else.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.920]   At first glance, many of you might think that's crazy, but it's exactly what my
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.560]   guest today, Ali Abdaal, did.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880]   He left the practice of medicine a few years ago to focus on his exploding and
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.520]   growing YouTube channel and the businesses that surround it, which now has more than
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.800]   3 million subscribers.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.960]   On it, he talks about everything from productivity, to study skills, to making
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.640]   an impact, and so much more.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760]   And if that's not enough, he hosts two podcasts, has two courses, a blog, and a
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   newsletter.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   I've consumed so much of Ali's content that I'm such a huge fan of his work.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.120]   So I'm really excited to talk about everything from how he got the courage to
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720]   quit a successful career, to double down on his passion and build a business around
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960]   it, a lesson I might need in the near future.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.360]   I also want to spend a good part of the conversation digging into the strategies,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.440]   the tools, the hacks he uses to live a happier, healthier, and more productive
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.840]   life.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.520]   He's a true expert here.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   He's dialed in when it comes to productivity, reading efficiently, the tech
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.400]   and the tools he uses, and a lot more.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720]   This is going to be a really great conversation.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.280]   There's probably going to be a lot more.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   So let's get started.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.520]   Ali, welcome to the show and thanks for being here.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.040]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.520]   That's an incredible intro.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.560]   You've really done your homework.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.520]   I'm just like, wow, that sounds really cool when you put it that way.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.240]   I'm excited.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.200]   So I want to start off and just talk about your passion for teaching.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   You said that being able to teach more through your YouTube channel, your
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.360]   podcast, your courses, and have an impact that way is a big reason you step back
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.560]   for medicine, but it must have been a tough decision.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   So what can you share about that process that might help anyone, myself included,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.280]   figure out what it takes to step away and take a big bet on yourself?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   Okay.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.160]   So a few things come to mind in no particular order.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.640]   Basically, I was always trying to figure out what the hell do I actually want to
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.320]   do with my life.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.880]   And after a couple of years in medicine, after going through med school, I always
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.000]   kind of knew I wanted to have some level of streams of passive income, financial
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.680]   independence.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   I've discovered the fire movement through Tim Ferriss's interview with Mr.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.440]   Money Mustache and got straight into that.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   I remember I was on my general practice placement when I discovered it.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.680]   And I was just like, I need to get through my patients as soon as possible so I can
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.240]   just read more articles on Mr.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.840]   Money Mustache.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.240]   But ever since I discovered the four hour work week at the age of 17, just before
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   going into med school, I knew that like medicine is cool, but it's not the only
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.960]   thing I want to be doing with my life.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.880]   Seems a bit, you know, not very anti-fragile to just be reliant on a single
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.520]   source of income.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   So throughout my whole time in med school, I always kind of knew that I wanted to
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.760]   dabble with like, maybe making a startup, maybe being interested in tech, because I
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   knew how to code and stuff and started a couple of businesses along the way.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   But really, like, as the YouTube channel started to become successful, and I
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.040]   really started to think, okay, what do I actually want to do with my life?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.480]   There were a couple of exercises that I discovered on the internet and various
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.800]   blogs that I found useful.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.960]   The first one was, I didn't have a name, but I'm calling it the gravestone
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.720]   technique, which is figuring out like, when you die, what do you want to be
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.960]   written on your gravestone?
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.720]   And for me, I thought about it.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.680]   And I realized some combination of good father, good husband, and inspirational
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.240]   teacher.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.040]   And I was like, Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.000]   I guess that is probably Yeah, you know, if I died, and people thought of me as an
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   inspirational teacher, alongside being a good father and a good husband, you're my
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   family, that would be a life well lived.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   And I was like, Okay, cool.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.480]   And then there was this other exercise I tried that a friend of mine who's like
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.880]   this business coach ran past me when I was like, Hey, man, Simon, like, what do I
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.400]   do with my life?
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.600]   He was like, try this exercise.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.000]   And it's called the ideal ordinary week, where you fast forward your Google
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.280]   calendar five years, you hope that you don't have any recurring events that are
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.800]   still there.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.080]   And you basically block out what does your ideal ordinary week look like?
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.480]   And so it's like, where are your time for deep work?
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   Where's lunch?
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.040]   Where's hanging out with friends?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.840]   Where's playing squash?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   Where's video games?
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.160]   Where's reading?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.960]   I went through that, and I looked at it, I was like, Oh, damn, there's not even a
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.040]   single half day here, where in my ideal ordinary week, I'm in a hospital treating
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.520]   patients.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.280]   And so those two data points together, kind of made me think, if I could design a
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.160]   life, however, I wanted, in theory, would I choose to spend time in a hospital
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.040]   treating patients and saving lives?
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.480]   The answer was like, I think it's great for a lot of people, but it really wasn't
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.880]   for me.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.760]   And I then looked back through my time in med school and being a doctor, and I
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.000]   realized that I much preferred teaching medical students than actually doing
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.480]   medicine.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.440]   And on days where I would have medical students with me, those would be the
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.360]   great days, because I'd be like, yeah, we can learn stuff.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.280]   Let's do shit together.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.920]   And on days where I didn't, I'd be like, I guess I've got to deal with patients
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.360]   myself.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.600]   Sounds really bad to say, but that gave me a big signal that maybe my quote
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.760]   calling, maybe the thing that I'm supposed to be doing is something to do with
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.560]   teaching rather than something to do with medicine.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.040]   And so that was the I guess, the philosophy behind what led to me ultimately
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   stepping back from the profession.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.640]   So maybe one thing that an exercise that I just came up with thinking about your
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.000]   process is to look back at what you're doing and your job and what are the parts
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.280]   of it where you really get fulfilled?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.960]   So for you, it was teaching within that role to younger students, like maybe
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.920]   there's something there.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   I interviewed Cal Newport last month, and he talked about trying to figure out the
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.840]   life you want, and then work backwards towards make it happen.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.160]   He calls it lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.880]   So is that something that you think came naturally?
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.640]   Or is that another version of this five year calendar?
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.160]   I was recently on a binge rereading of Cal's blog posts from like 2008 to 2012.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.880]   I came across this kind of lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.800]   And I was like, damn, this is basically what I did.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   I just didn't realize that Cal Newport had already said it about 10 years ago.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.080]   And I should have just read his blog post because it would have saved me a lot of
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.960]   time. But I've now seen that play out in a lot of decisions I'm making with this
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.480]   business as well, instead of thinking, I've got this thing, what do I do with it?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.760]   It's more like, okay, what is the actual lifestyle that I want?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.160]   And how do I then reverse engineer the stuff that I'm doing today to optimize for
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.040]   that particular lifestyle?
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.000]   When it came to paying the bills, right, a lot of times I see people encourage
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.280]   others, maybe not themselves to say, Oh, take a bet on yourself now, take a bet on
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.040]   yourself now. And people often maybe default more towards waiting till their side
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.600]   business is so big that it's like an obvious decision.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.040]   Is there a point where you think people should actually maybe wait a little longer
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.400]   or take the leap a little earlier?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.240]   What have you kind of reflecting what you did think now?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.960]   Yeah, so for me, I waited until the side business was like ridiculously huge before
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.800]   making the leap. But I was also in a career where after two years of working as a
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.560]   doctor, there's a very natural career break where a lot of people take time out.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.360]   And then it makes a lot of sense to take time out at that point.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.840]   Whereas I've got a bunch of friends who are in careers where it never makes sense to
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.640]   take time out because you're always going to be worried about the gap in the resume
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.040]   and stuff. And especially my friends in management consulting, it's always like, oh,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.280]   the next promotion, the next round of bonuses is when I will do the thing.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.120]   And they never end up doing the thing because it's not like a hard stop of like, two
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.840]   years later, you're out of a job.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.800]   And now you have to reapply for the next round of residency, specialty training or
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.560]   whatever. So I kind of think I had it easy in that the decision was made for me in
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.120]   that a) the business became ridiculously successful and b) I already had this career
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.160]   gap that I was going to take.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.800]   I think if I had my time again or if I were advising someone and they were young and
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.360]   actually I very much vibe with the Gary Vee approach of like when you're young and
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   unencumbered, that's when taking risks, the whole asymmetrical upside thing that if
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.160]   you start a business and it pays off, you are then sorted for life.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   Whereas you lose out on an extra few tens of thousands of dollars worth of earnings.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.960]   And unless you really, really, really need that money for you and your family to
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.680]   survive, I think being young and unencumbered is a great time to take risks.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.120]   You knew you wanted to teach, right?
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.880]   You talked about how you got fulfillment from that.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.360]   It's not clear to me that if you were thinking, what am I going to take a bet on?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.880]   What is it going to be that you knew what it would become ultimately?
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.120]   Are there things you learned along the way that helped you figure out how to take,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.920]   OK, I love teaching and turn that into I want a YouTube channel.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.400]   I want here's what I actually want to teach about.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   You know, here are the different mediums, whether it's a newsletter, a blog.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.200]   How do you go down that path?
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.080]   For me, it was there's this thing I was passionate about.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.520]   I would say most of my friends almost all knew that one day I would be talking
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.760]   about optimization of life and travel and money and all this stuff.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   Everyone else knew that.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   But for me, I was like, maybe I should start a podcast.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.120]   And at first, the podcast was actually going to be about parenting
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.400]   because I was about to have my first child.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.520]   And I was like trying to dial in everything.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.120]   And then slowly I was like, well, maybe I don't love the parenting thing
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   as much as the broader topic.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.480]   But it was not natural, right?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   Like 10 years ago, people probably could have better predicted
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.560]   I would be doing this than I could have done it myself.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.640]   Yeah, I think it's kind of similar for me.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.960]   It sort of felt like just one step in front of another.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.320]   So when I was 18 years old
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.640]   and in the summer holidays just before going to med school,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.960]   I had saved up about a thousand pounds, like twelve hundred dollars
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.600]   through private tutoring here and there for years and years to get a MacBook.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.600]   I was like, I'm going to get a MacBook for the first time in my life.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   I'm going to join the Apple ecosystem.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.520]   Apple products are super expensive, but now I can finally afford it.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   And instead of buying the base model MacBook Air from the Apple Store in 2012,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.920]   I decided I was going to go on Craigslist and find one that was more specked out.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.120]   I found some guy we met up at the station.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   He handed me this laptop.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.200]   I forked over a thousand pounds in cash and turned out he'd actually sold me
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.280]   like a four year old defunct model of a MacBook Air.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   And because I was an idiot, I kind of took his word for it.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.480]   I ignored all the red flags that were there.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.320]   And I was like, oh, my God, I've lost all this money.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.160]   I spent a month trying to get it back and trying to geolocate his tweets
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.560]   to see where is he, where can I serve him papers to take him
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.120]   to small claims court and like sue him and stuff.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.520]   And eventually my mom was like, you know what, screw this guy.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   You're about to start university.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.320]   And she just bought me a new MacBook.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.640]   And she was like, just forget about this guy, which was very nice of her.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.400]   But at that point, I opened up an Evernote document and I still got it
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.640]   from like August of 2012, where I said, OK, I need to make money.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.320]   What are the things I'm good at and what are the things I enjoy doing?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.240]   And on the list of things that I was good at, I put teaching.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.040]   I put web design and I put I did well in med school admissions exams.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.560]   And I was like, sick.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.120]   How do I make a business that involves teaching web design
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.520]   and med school entrance exams?
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.360]   Huh. Why don't I make a business that teaches courses
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.320]   for med school entrance exams?
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   And why don't I make a website
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.920]   that markets this nationally and undercut all the other competitors
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.960]   and make a website that just looks more pro than anyone else is on the market?
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.640]   Because I could do that.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.840]   And that was how my first kind of successful business started
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.880]   when I was at university.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.640]   And then really five years later, I'd sort of gotten a bit bored of that business.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   But I was reading a lot about SEO and content marketing.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.000]   And I was like, content marketing is a thing.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.400]   No one is really making high quality YouTube videos
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.920]   teaching medical school admissions.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.320]   So if I make videos on YouTube teaching med school admissions
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.560]   and teaching people how to get a med school in the UK,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.440]   maybe some of them will convert and buy my course or sign up to my email list.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.360]   This sort of content marketing funnel thing
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.080]   that I had a very unsophisticated knowledge of at the time.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.600]   And that was how the YouTube channel got started.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.720]   So connecting the dots, looking back, it feels like, yes, of course,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   I was going to do something in teaching
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.280]   because I've been teaching from like the age of seven.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.120]   My job when I was 13 involved private tutoring.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.680]   I was always teaching medical students and people were always asking me
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.200]   to explain stuff, whether it was medical stuff or website stuff
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.600]   or like productivity stuff.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.040]   But it was really just sort of putting one step in front of another
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.880]   and putting things together that ultimately led me to this point
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.320]   where I guess we're here trusting.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.160]   But I mean, it wasn't an overnight success, right?
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.000]   You mentioned when you left your medical career,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.040]   the channel had grown big enough that it was an easier decision.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.160]   There are people who have successful followings.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   They start a YouTube channel.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.520]   They start a podcast and overnight success.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.680]   If I recall, you started with like zero followers, zero views, zero anything
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.400]   and had to build it up.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.760]   How did you stay motivated?
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.600]   I know that's a grueling process.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.120]   So, yeah, I started with zero followers.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.320]   I think I had about 37 subscribers on YouTube just because I had a YouTube
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.960]   account from like 2008.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.320]   So it's like 37 subscribers.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.760]   Yes. The way I stayed motivated was.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   In general, I only set goals that are within my control.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.160]   And so the goal that I set for my YouTube channel was like,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.600]   I think this has potential.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.200]   I think maybe this could go somewhere.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.600]   But the only thing I'm going to think about is I just need to make one
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   or two videos every week and I'm not going to care about the numbers.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   And maybe a year from now, if I can hit, I don't know,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.920]   a few thousand subscribers, that would be incredible.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.840]   I did a bit of market research.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.640]   I was like, oh, there's that person over there who's making medical content.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.680]   And I think I can make better videos than she can.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.880]   And she's on 4000 subscribers.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.760]   So maybe if things go really well, I can be on 4000 subscribers.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.360]   But really, the goal was just one foot in front of the other.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.920]   How do I just make sure I bang out a video or two every week?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.320]   And by just staying true to that particular thing
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.680]   and not being overly wedded to outcomes that are outside of my control,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.240]   like how many views are getting or how many subscribers or revenue?
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.560]   That's how I stayed motivated to do it.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.680]   And along the way, just found ways to make it interesting for myself.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.760]   Oh, I get to learn editing.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.960]   I get to try this new transition and get to try this new thing.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.280]   And let me try and explain this in a little bit of a different way.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.200]   The goals that are within my control exclusively and finding a way
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.280]   to keep the process fun for myself.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.400]   Did you ever find that a video maybe did well on a topic,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.720]   but maybe you weren't that excited about that topic and have to balance
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.800]   like what's personally exciting to you, to what's working
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.920]   and growing for your business or your brand and have to pick?
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.240]   Yeah, so in the early days, that was not really a consideration
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.160]   because I didn't have any videos that did well.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.760]   I was just like, cool, let's just keep going.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.160]   Yeah, I mean, the videos are doing OK.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.720]   People are viewing them. People are commenting.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.080]   This is kind of nice.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.920]   Even got recognized in the street one time and I was like, oh, my God, I've made it.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.480]   That was when I had like 2000 subscribers.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.560]   But it's been really more of a thing that I've had to figure out now
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.840]   because now we're at a point where the channel is five years old.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.720]   I kind of know that if I do a video about personal finance,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.160]   about like passive income, about how I make however many million a year,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.040]   it's going to get loads of views.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.600]   And I know I enjoy talking about those topics, but I often think to myself like,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.800]   OK, if we took money out of the equation and if we took status out of the equation
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.760]   and if we took the sort of the need to accumulate more and more
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   out of the equation completely, what would I be doing with my time?
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   What is the YouTube channel that I would want?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.560]   And I always think, yeah, I still make YouTube videos
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   because I like teaching and YouTube videos are teaching a scale
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.840]   and I get to learn and cool shit and teach it to people, which is nice.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.600]   But do I really want a channel where all the only videos I make
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.760]   are about finance or crypto because that's currently doing well?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.320]   No, I want a channel where I can hit record and talk about anything,
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.800]   whether it's, oh, my God, guys, check out Chris's podcast.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.280]   It's sick. Or like, I just read this book.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.480]   It's incredible. And here's a summary.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.600]   Or here is why I use this pen pocket knife to unbox my parcels.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.240]   In my mind, I'm thinking
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   I want to have the YouTube channel that I wish Tim Ferriss would have
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.040]   where I would just lap up anything that he posts on YouTube
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.280]   and just be like, Tim, man, I just want you to make two videos a week
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.440]   where you talk about whatever's on your mind and I would just watch it.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.720]   And I'm like, OK, let me have that kind of channel that I know I'd want to watch.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.480]   Is that the future of where the channel is going?
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.680]   I think so. I think my dream is where the channel is.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.880]   I can make videos about whatever I want.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.280]   And the team that I've built around me takes care of everything else,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.560]   like the money side of the equation, the figuring out the funnels,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.760]   figuring out the products and figuring out a way
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.200]   to make this whole thing sustainable for the long term.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.560]   So I don't know if this is going to be a topic that fits in line
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.840]   with that future channel or not, but a lot of the content you've made
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   is about productivity, getting more done, optimizing your time.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's something I'm really passionate about.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.000]   You have this great ultimate guide to productivity.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.160]   I'll link it to the show notes.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.240]   We don't need to cover everything, but I would love to run through
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.000]   some of the core components you think are important to someone just starting to say,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.600]   OK, how do I really dial in my productivity?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.440]   And we might go a little deeper on a few things along the way.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.360]   Where do you start with someone saying, OK, is there an inventory
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.000]   someone should take?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.240]   Like, what's the first step?
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.360]   Because some people might already be at the 201 level, the 101 level.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.400]   Yeah. How do you get people in the door thinking about productivity?
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.960]   Yeah. So I've got a bunch of different disorganized thoughts about this.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.440]   But actually, I did a podcast interview with my productivity
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.880]   coach or performance coach.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.320]   His name is Chris Sparks earlier today, and he has a quiz on his website.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.120]   It's completely free.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.720]   It's called the performance assessment.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   It's on like forcing function dot com forward slash assessment.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   And that's a quiz that I took two years ago.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.160]   And it's basically asks you questions like, do you have a vision for your life?
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.040]   And do you have goals?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.080]   And do you look at those goals?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.200]   And do you do weekly reviews?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.440]   And in the morning, do you check your email first thing?
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.360]   Or do you have a hard stop?
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   Do you have a bedtime routine?
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.640]   Do you have a morning routine?
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.120]   And based on the answers to those questions, it basically says, OK,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.200]   here are all of the things you could be doing to increase your productivity.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.840]   But start with this one.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.440]   And it orders all of the evidence based productivity tips
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.080]   in order of how needle moving they actually are.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.360]   And I think that quiz would be a I've been recommending it today
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.400]   to everyone on my team being like, guys, take this quiz because it's actually
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.520]   really good whenever I take it.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.600]   It always helps me realize, oh, you know, I'm not doing weekly reviews.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.680]   I should probably do a weekly review
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   because it's a thing that is really, really helpful.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.240]   That would be where I would start.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.280]   And I kind of wish I made something like that.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.240]   But in the meantime, I think that's the best resource that I can point people to.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.640]   OK, obviously, I haven't taken this quiz.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.280]   I probably will do it as soon as we wrap up.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.520]   I'll put the link to the show notes.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.000]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.320]   And that's thanks to Viori.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.960]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.240]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.640]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.400]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.200]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.080]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.520]   you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viori,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.320]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.120]   And it's not just for men.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.760]   My wife is as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.400]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.120]   I think I have three pairs, and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.160]   I've ever owned.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.960]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.240]   whether it's running, training or yoga.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.920]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.480]   or their meta pants can even work for a night out.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.840]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.080]   And for All The Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.520]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.000]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.120]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.240]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.960]   And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.560]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.360]   And I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.440]   It tastes so good when it's cold.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.880]   And I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day,
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.240]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.040]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins,
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.920]   minerals and superfoods and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.080]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial anything.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.480]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D

[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.960]   All you have to do is visit all the hacks dot com slash Athletic Greens.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.080]   Again, that's all the hacks dot com slash Athletic Greens

[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.080]   daily nutritional insurance.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.320]   Let's run through a few aspects of productivity.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.560]   I'll focus on ones that I'm most interested in is just not wasting time
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.000]   procrastinating, pushing things off, getting distracted.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.200]   What are your suggestions there?
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.400]   I know this was an interview I was really excited to prepare for.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.920]   Yet somehow, even though there was a hard start last night,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.200]   I found myself going down a rabbit hole of something that was less time sensitive,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.640]   but definitely interesting.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.360]   Help me out. Hmm.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.080]   Yeah, the whole thing about procrastination,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.760]   I am in the process of writing three book chapters on this for my book,
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.320]   so I've had the whole procrastination thing in my mind
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.880]   and in my headspace for the last few weeks.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   Essentially, I think the first step is to.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.800]   Appreciate the difference between procrastination and prioritization,
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.880]   because a lot of people will say that they don't have time to do something.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.760]   I know that you aren't like that because you're in this optimization space.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   But when people say, oh, I don't have time to do X,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.320]   I want to learn Japanese, but I don't have time.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.400]   I always think if I'm in the mode of giving unsolicited advice
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.120]   or if they're asking me for advice, I'd be like, OK,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.520]   do you not have time, like genuinely, or is it just not a priority?
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.160]   And people like, no, I don't feel like I have the time.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.480]   I work full time. I've got kids. I've got to put them to bed.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.240]   I'm like, OK, fair enough. You haven't got the time.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.200]   Basically what that means is it's not a priority.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.080]   Then I say something like, OK, if I gave you a million dollars
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.280]   every time you did 20 minutes of Japanese practice,
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.040]   would you do the 20 minutes of Japanese practice?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.160]   And they're like, oh, hell yeah.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.000]   And I'm like, OK, cool.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.760]   So you're consciously deprioritizing Japanese
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520]   because there are other more important things in your life.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.560]   And that's totally fine.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.240]   That doesn't mean you're procrastinating from this thing.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.840]   So there's no need to beat yourself up about it.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.080]   It just means it's not a priority in your life.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.360]   And then people are like, OK, cool.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.320]   But I have this thing that is a priority in my life.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.000]   And then that takes us down an interesting conversation of like,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.560]   how do we actually prioritize things that we say are a priority?
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.280]   I wonder if you like this as well.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.200]   I feel like it's easy to give advice and then we just don't take our own advice.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.280]   So when it comes to book writing, for example, literally last week,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.080]   my editor and I had a call.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.960]   She was like, how's progress on the book this week?
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.400]   And I was like, oh, you know, stuff came up.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.640]   Oh, you know, this happened and that happened and this happened.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.840]   She was like, OK. She was super nice about it.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.480]   But she was like, you know, it sounds like this book
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.680]   is supposed to be a priority in your life. Is it actually?
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.840]   And I was like, yeah, it is.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   It definitely is. It's my number one priority.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.200]   And she was like, OK, so then why aren't you prioritizing it?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.880]   And I was like, damn, you're right, Rachel.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.760]   And then we figured out strategies to help me prioritize that
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.160]   and actually make time for it.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.640]   And happy to go over the strategies.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.200]   But those have really helped in the last week.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.840]   I've been able to make so much more progress than I did in the last month.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.040]   Let's get into it.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.760]   My biggest satisfaction when I get an email from a listener is
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.040]   I took all these notes of tactics listening to this episode.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.600]   So let's get into all of them.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.280]   Amazing. OK, so basically three part way to approach this equation.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.040]   Essentially.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.200]   Let's start with the problem.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.360]   My opening gambit is going to be that procrastination
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.240]   is not a problem with doing the work.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.440]   Procrastination is a problem with starting the work,
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.920]   because usually once you've gotten started with something,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.960]   it's generally easy enough to keep on going.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.040]   Newton's first law, the law of inertia.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.000]   It takes energy to get the flywheel going.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.800]   But once it's going, it's like, oh, you know, you're into the swing of things.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.960]   You're enjoying the thing that you're doing.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.800]   You're getting energy from it.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.320]   And it's usually not so bad.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.960]   Does that broadly vibe with your experience of procrastinating as well?
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.560]   Yeah, I think it's probably two part.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.000]   It's hard to get started.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.480]   And then it's hard to avoid the shiny objects that pop in front of you,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.200]   like an email, some alert or something.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.240]   So those those two are big for me. Yes, exactly.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.280]   Yeah. So the way I think of them is I separate out procrastination,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.360]   which is the getting started problem from distraction,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.000]   which is the how do I focus once I've already gotten started?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.600]   The distraction stuff is all fairly simple.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.320]   It's like turn off notifications.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Great hack I discovered the other day.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.440]   Option and clicking on a Mac on your time in the corner
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.200]   automatically puts your Mac into do not disturb mode,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.040]   which automatically silences all notifications,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.920]   except the ones that you let through from a loved one or something like that.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.960]   So I've been using that a lot this last week.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.880]   And now I just don't see my notifications
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.360]   until I go to the toilet to take a break.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.760]   I'm like, oh, hello.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.280]   I'm so glad I missed all the notifications
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.160]   because they would have just completely taken me out of flow
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.760]   and got me very distracted.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.520]   But just for the procrastination stuff, then we can talk about distraction in a sec.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.560]   If we accept that procrastination is ultimately a problem with getting started,
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.320]   and that's the thing that we're trying to optimize for,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   it's like, OK, what are the barriers that stop us from getting started with something?
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.400]   I think broadly, there's three things there.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.680]   And I call them I like to give things names in my mind.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.160]   The fog of obscurity, the bridge of anxiety and the hump of inertia
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.600]   probably to come up with better names.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.080]   I sort of have a bit of a diagram in my head.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.280]   And the fog of obscurity is where, you know, you want to do a thing,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   but you actually don't know specifically what you need to do
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.800]   or when you're going to do it or where you're going to do it
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.920]   or how you're going to do it.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   And then you're just like, oh, you know, there's this thing.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.720]   It's like, oh, I need to start that podcast.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.160]   But if you don't know what that first step is or what the next step is,
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.400]   it's just so hard to even think about getting started
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.040]   because now there's this enormous like mental barrier
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.920]   that's stopping us from actually moving forward in this thing.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.880]   And so the solution to that one is basically just make a very, very concrete plan.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.680]   And what I like to do is separate the planning of a thing
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.400]   from the doing of a thing, because it's very easy to make a plan, right?
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.360]   If, for example, I need to work out,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.080]   it's very easy for me to procrastinate when I don't have a plan.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.880]   I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know why I'm working out.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.240]   But if I was talking to someone right now and they were to be like, all right,
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.680]   what's your plan for the workout?
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.960]   I'd be like, I can make a plan. It's not that hard making a plan.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.080]   You know what? I'll do it tonight, 7 p.m.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.960]   Yeah, I'll go to the gym that's in my building and I'll do, you know,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.880]   let me bring up Reddit fitness and find a workout plan.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.520]   And it's taken me two minutes to make a plan.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.200]   But now I'm far more likely to actually go and do the thing.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.760]   I either work out because I've got a slot in my calendar for it.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.000]   And I know what I'm doing.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.360]   I think it's really just about those two things, finding a slot in the calendar
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.560]   and then actually knowing what to do.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.760]   And that is broadly how you tackle the fog of obscurity.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.600]   Are you with me so far? Any thoughts? Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   No, no, I'm here. Yes. Nice.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.320]   And then there are other things we can do with this.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.040]   If I'm coaching someone or this is the method that this chap Chris,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.720]   this productivity coach that I had, but it was always like, OK,
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.320]   so for me at the time, I wanted to get good at art because I was thinking,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.600]   you know what, I wanted to take some art lessons because why not?
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.240]   It was like, OK, what's the next step?
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.960]   I was like, OK, I guess find an art teacher.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.120]   It was like, OK, how are you going to do that?
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.920]   I was like, OK, post on Instagram and be like, hey, anyone want to teach me art?
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.000]   And also, like, just do a Google search for art teachers in Cambridge.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.240]   And I was like, cool, when are you going to do that?
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.600]   And I was like, shit, OK, I guess I've got a 15 minute slot
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.440]   in my calendar two hours from now.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.880]   It was like, cool, put it in the calendar.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.040]   And I was like, cool.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.720]   And it was like, OK, now you've got a slot in your calendar.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.080]   Fast forward this time next week.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.640]   You and I are chatting and you have not found an art teacher.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.440]   What are the top three reasons why you've not found an art teacher?
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.280]   And I was like, OK, maybe something came up and I was super busy.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.320]   Maybe I looked on Google and I couldn't find anyone in the first two results.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.640]   And so I gave up.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Maybe no one replied to my Instagram thing.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.160]   And it was like, OK, cool, that's fine.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.400]   How might you mitigate against each of those risks?
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.040]   I was like, OK, maybe I mean, I can just like look at ten Google results
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.640]   rather than five.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.480]   I can maybe post on Twitter as well, not Instagram.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.520]   It's like you're coming up with strategies ahead of time,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.960]   knowing that I am a dumbass and my brain is going to encourage me
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   to procrastinate from this thing.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.880]   But if I try and nudge myself in the direction of doing the thing
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   that I know I want to do, I get art lessons.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.440]   I'm far more likely to actually do the thing.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.560]   And so just working through this loop a single time.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.520]   The final question there is what is the action you can take right now
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.200]   that will almost guarantee that you'll actually do this thing
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.560]   when it comes to the time?
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.000]   I was like, OK, you know what?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.800]   While I'm here, I'll just type out the message
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.120]   I'm going to post on my Instagram story.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.320]   So I literally opened Apple Notes.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.400]   I typed out, hey, guys, looking for an art teacher.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.520]   Anyone want to teach me art over Zoom?
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.560]   And then when it came to two hours later, I just copied and pasted
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.920]   that onto Instagram, and now I found an art teacher.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.240]   And just through that one action, I'd been procrastinating
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.520]   from taking art lessons for three years at that point.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.560]   But all it took was a conversation with a guy who had paid a lot of money
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.040]   to ask me a basic question of what are you doing, when are you doing it?
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.520]   And just giving me this framework to think about decision making here.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.720]   And I took art lessons for about six months, but it was super fun.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.560]   That's amazing.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.640]   OK, so that's getting past the first start.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.960]   Yeah, I can't remember.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.240]   So it was fog of obscurity, something and then a hump.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.840]   Yeah, exactly. OK, cool.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.400]   So fog of obscurity is the first one.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.080]   You know, you've gotten over the fog of obscurity when the thing
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.960]   that you're trying to do,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.000]   you've got it in the calendar and you know what you're doing.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.840]   That's all you need.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.760]   At that point, you have enough clarity on the task to be able to make progress on it.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.960]   But if you don't have those two crucial points and everything else,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.920]   it just kind of goes out the window.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.160]   Basically, getting clarity on what you're doing and when you're doing it
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   is like just the magical solution to that.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.800]   And you don't need to pay a performance
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.040]   coach large amounts of money to encourage you to basically do that.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.160]   The next one is what I like to call the bridge of anxiety.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.400]   And this is where we appreciate that a lot of procrastination
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.880]   doesn't come from not having the time to do something.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.640]   It comes from actually our emotions that get in our way.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.280]   And there's a researcher called Tim Pitchell, who has a great book.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.280]   I think it's called The Procrastination Puzzle, which is basically
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.920]   all about the emotional side of procrastination.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.760]   And he researches this and talks about all the different
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.600]   emotional barriers that get in our way.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.800]   The example I use a lot is people who procrastinate
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.960]   from starting a YouTube channel, for example.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.240]   And it's like, yeah, I know that I've got my time slot
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.600]   and I know I just need to film this video
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.640]   because I've taken Ali Abdaal's course on YouTube or whatever.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.440]   I know I just need to film the video.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.960]   But you're in the time slot and there's something that's stopping you,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.040]   something that's holding you back
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   from doing this thing which you claim to want, crucially.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.280]   And it's like, what's going on there?
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.120]   And there's this thing in the world of meditational mindfulness
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.120]   called the RAIN method. Have you come across this?
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.440]   No. So the RAIN method, Tara Brock talks about this quite a lot.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   I think it was invented like 20 years ago by some other meditation practitioner.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.920]   Basically, the idea is that any time an emotion is getting in our way,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.320]   we want to follow the RAIN method.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.400]   So R-A-I-N. So R is recognize.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.720]   So recognize that what the feeling is, it's getting in the way.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.000]   In the case of I'm struggling to start my YouTube channel,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.400]   I'm struggling to post that video.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.520]   It's probably some kind of fear or rather some kind of anxiety,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.200]   because I'm going to cite Brene Brown's Atlas of the Heart,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.000]   which defines fear as when there is a threat to your survival right now
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.960]   and anxiety as there is a potential threat to your survival
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.320]   at some point in the future, maybe.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.160]   And so no one ever procrastinates from running away from a lion,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.320]   but we procrastinate from public speaking.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.640]   We procrastinate from starting the podcast, from writing a blog,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.000]   from putting ourselves out there in some way because we perceive
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.120]   that there is a potential threat to our survival, i.e.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.360]   our social status within our group at some point, maybe in the future.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.960]   And just recognizing that as a thing that like, yeah,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.280]   I don't want this video to go out
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.840]   because I'm afraid of what people will think of me. OK, cool.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.560]   We've recognized the emotion that's getting in our way.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.640]   Then we have A for allow, which is basically that that's totally fine.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.160]   I don't need to moralize.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.440]   I don't need to beat myself up for having this emotion.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.000]   But yeah, I have a fear that people are going to look down on me
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   if I start a TikTok page, because I feel that people are going to judge me.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.760]   And I feel that that's going to be really bad
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.320]   for my social standing in my group, and that's totally OK. I'm human.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.880]   Then we have I, which is investigate, which is like getting curious.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.680]   Huh? I wonder where this feeling is coming from.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.440]   Why do I feel like if I started a YouTube channel or if I started a podcast
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.520]   or if I started talking about airline point
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.320]   hacking on a podcast that suddenly it would be a bad thing?
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.160]   Oh, I wonder what's going on there.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.760]   And that's where you just take a few minutes to explore your feelings
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.400]   around that thing.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.760]   And then N stands for either nurture or non-identification,
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.800]   depending on who you ask.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.920]   And basically what that means is just this appreciation
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.680]   in the world of meditation and mindfulness that we are not our feelings.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.040]   Just because I have the feeling of fear does not mean I am that thing
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.800]   and does not mean necessarily that I need to let that hold me back.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.640]   And this idea that the way you feel about something
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.760]   actually doesn't really have any bearing on whether you do the thing or not.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.680]   I might not feel like going to work in the morning, but I'm going to go to work.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.880]   Anyway, I might not feel like brushing my teeth
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.120]   because I can't be bothered, but I'm going to brush my teeth anyway.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.600]   Similarly, just because I feel the fear of starting my podcast
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.480]   and talking about airline point hacking,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.640]   that doesn't necessarily mean like I have to identify with that.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.440]   I can choose to act in spite of that fear.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.920]   And so that's where we kind of go a little bit emotional
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.400]   and a little bit like trying to figure out.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.760]   And I've got a bunch of more specific things, but I think that's the general
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.320]   kind of rain method for dealing with any kind of emotion that gets in our way.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.400]   OK, I'm practically thinking about a few ways that I would have used this.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.640]   I feel like the one place where I get stuck is like, oh, I'm trying to get
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.320]   a specific person to come on the show.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.560]   And what's the email say? When do I send it?
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.200]   And then I end up just sending the thing that I drafted like two weeks ago.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.240]   And now I'm just like, I just waited two weeks to do the thing
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.320]   I was already going to do because it's not writing it.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.440]   I've even written the email.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.800]   It's like trying to figure out, is there a more optimal way to do something?
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.600]   Maybe I can find a friend who knows the person and that would be better.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.560]   So I should hold off.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.120]   But I don't think even doing it precludes you from finding another path
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.840]   if it doesn't work.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   So yeah, I just need to like zone in on why I'm not doing it.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.920]   No, exactly. Yeah, I think that's interesting.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.960]   There's another point here.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.640]   Again, it's fresh in my mind because me and Chris were talking about this.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.920]   So Chris, this productivity coach who I interviewed is a professional poker player.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.960]   And we were talking about kind of lessons
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.200]   he's learned from the world of poker that apply to life.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.960]   And there's a concept that apparently people who play poker use,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.160]   which is the idea of expected value, which you and some listeners
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.240]   might be familiar with, basically the magnitude of the outcome you want,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.560]   like how good is this thing?
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.880]   Will this thing make me $100?
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.320]   Cool. And then multiplied by the probability of the thing happening.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.880]   So if I've got a 50% chance of making $100, the expected value
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.480]   of every time I flip the coin is $50, for example.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.200]   And expected value poker players shorten to EV
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.440]   because people like these sorts of acronyms.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.040]   And whenever poker players are making decisions, they're like, oh,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.680]   it's either a plus EV or a minus EV decision.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.440]   That is the expected value positive or is it negative?
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.400]   And what they mean there is that if I did this decision every time,
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.160]   would I expect to come out on top or would I expect to not come out on top?
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.120]   Now, in the case of you're sending an email,
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.520]   that sounds like a pretty plus EV decision, because if you were to send 100 emails,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.640]   maybe a handful of people replied to you.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.680]   But it's not like there's any real downside.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.560]   And so rather than being wedded to the specific outcome of this decision
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.520]   that I really want this person, how do I reach out to them?
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.920]   I remember the email you sent me.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.640]   You were like, yeah, I was kind of procrastinating a bit.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.920]   I was kind of thinking we might have it in, but then I thought I'd just email you.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.000]   I just owned the feeling in the email.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.080]   Yeah, I love it because I have that same feeling.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.240]   I'm always like, oh, maybe I couldn't possibly just cold email someone.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.520]   I've got to find some kind of way of like DMing them on Twitter in some way
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.400]   and getting them to follow me.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.960]   And it's just all plus EV.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.880]   Like it's just sending a cold email is always a plus EV decision
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.640]   because there's literally no downside to it.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.840]   And chances are, if someone didn't respond to the email,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.200]   they either didn't want to talk to you or didn't see it.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.560]   So if you reach out to them through some other channel,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.640]   if they didn't see it, maybe it'll work.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.680]   If they don't want to talk to you, they probably won't respond there either.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.360]   So I don't know.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.240]   I'm I'm I'm coaching myself through this conversation.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.040]   OK, let's hit the last one.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.640]   The last one is the hump of inertia.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.880]   And that is this recognition that like for whatever we're struggling with,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.480]   whatever we're struggling to get started with,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.360]   there's always a little bit of a push of energy
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.400]   that we need to get started with the thing.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.800]   Now, the question is, like, how do we get there?
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.440]   Once we've got the clarity on the thing, once we've tried to figure out
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.760]   what our emotions are getting in the way at some points,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.120]   some stuff is just kind of boring and you just kind of have to do it.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.160]   So like, how do you nudge yourself to just get started?
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.400]   At this point, some people would say that motivation is a thing.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.680]   You've got to motivate yourself to do it.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.840]   You've got to really want it.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   You've got to want it so much that you can't breathe or whatever.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.560]   These motivational videos say, and that's fine.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.360]   But there's a great book by Jeff Hayden called The Motivation Myth,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.920]   which basically argues that motivation is a bit of a myth.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.240]   Like we don't summon up the motivation magically to do a thing.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   We do the thing.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.960]   And by seeing a small success, that then helps us
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.720]   summon the motivation to continue to do the thing.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.800]   And so really, motivation doesn't lead to action.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.560]   Action leads to motivation.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.080]   And so understanding that, I think, was a big unlock for me that like, really,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.520]   just because I don't feel like doing something
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.360]   doesn't actually stop me from doing the thing.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.520]   And therefore, I can just do it.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.200]   And sometimes that works where I just tell myself that
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.960]   I could just get out of bed right now, even though I don't feel like it.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.840]   That's like the motivation approach.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.080]   And you've got like the discipline approach, the willpower approach,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.200]   the David Goggins approach.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.920]   If you're not doing it at that point, you're just soft.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.440]   You just got to use the willpower.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.520]   You've got to use grit, determination, discipline to push through and do the thing.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.640]   That's fine as well. That works.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.000]   The thing that I personally like to do is I like to tell myself,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.360]   I'm just going to do the thing for two minutes
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.960]   and then I'm going to stop doing the thing.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.760]   I've got a couple of songs on my Spotify playlist,
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.800]   which are like two minutes long, like instrumental songs.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.440]   And I'll just like put on one of the songs.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.200]   I mean, I'm just going to do this thing until the end of the song.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.440]   And usually the song ends, the next one plays on shuffle.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.720]   And I don't even realize that I've just continued doing the thing.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   Occasionally I just do it for two minutes and then I stop.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.520]   And I think, cool, that's fine. It's not my day.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.560]   I say 90% of the time, as long as I can just talk myself into doing it
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.120]   for two minutes, then I'm unlikely to stop doing it
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.720]   because once I've gotten to the swing of things, it's a lot easier to get started.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.120]   And I guess my final point on this is if all else fails,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.600]   something that will never fail is actually putting money on the line.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.000]   My friend Thomas Frank is this huge YouTuber, two and a half million subscribers.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.920]   The way he motivated himself to publish videos in the early days of his channel
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.720]   when no one was watching was an app called Beeminder,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.120]   which is an automatic thing where it like connects to your YouTube RSS feed.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.600]   And if you don't publish a video every week, it will take $30
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.640]   out of your debit card or out of your bank account just completely automatically.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.840]   And that was how he made himself accountable.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.360]   He's like, well, I've got to publish a video every week.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.200]   Otherwise, I'm losing $30.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.400]   Now, depending on who you are, $30 might not seem like enough money,
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.520]   but it needs to be enough money to sting.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.400]   So one thing that I've actually tried in the past is giving my housemate
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.960]   £1,000 and saying, if I don't do this thing, you get to keep the £1,000.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.560]   And that has just worked magically for me to do absolutely anything.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.760]   I don't like using it all the time.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.000]   I'd much rather use all these other nicer methods.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.400]   But that is a fail safe.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.000]   If I'm ever really struggling to do a thing that I know I have to do,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.320]   like write £1,000, transfer the money, and they can always give it back to me
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.600]   once I've done the thing.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.480]   I love that one.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.200]   And it probably depends on the circumstance.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.360]   I was running today with our daughter in a stroller, which, by the way,
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.400]   for anyone who doesn't have kids, once you start running with a child,
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.160]   you're like, I'm now a horrible runner.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.240]   I've taken like 10 steps back because I'm now pushing this stroller
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.320]   and I just can't run as fast.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.080]   I use the Goggins approach, which is like,
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.640]   am I really going to tell myself that I can't just make it
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   to the end of this neighborhood?
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.000]   Like, I really can't do that.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.840]   That works really well.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.960]   But I don't think that works as well when you're like sitting down at your desk
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   to complete a task.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.600]   So having all the tools is probably pretty helpful. Yeah.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.080]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.600]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.360]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.400]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.840]   the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.920]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.000]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.160]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.640]   Or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.600]   with Drizzly.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.320]   You can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.360]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.400]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.440]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.360]   on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.760]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.040]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.400]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:25.400]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.680]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.960]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.320]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.520]   deals and discounts from our partners.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.760]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.200]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.680]   You mentioned a few apps in the conversation.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.400]   You mentioned you put notes in Apple Notes.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.640]   You mentioned this Beeminder.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.720]   I'm curious, right before we started, I was just doing some quick
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.280]   last minute research, went to Twitter.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.280]   You posted this 24 apps that you use.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.800]   I don't need to go through all 24, but I'm curious
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.000]   how you process information and where you put it.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.360]   What is the main stack for processing email or a new newsletter
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.560]   or something you find that you want to read later?
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.600]   Because I find that a lot of the distraction that comes is like,
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.880]   Oh, there's a thing I want to read it.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.320]   Oh, this thing popped up.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.440]   How do I stay on top of it all?
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:26.840]   Nice.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.120]   So the app that I used to use until about three months ago was Instapaper.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.320]   Unsurprisingly, it's great.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.400]   Anytime I'd see a link, I'd either share it to Instapaper or right click,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   save to Instapaper or open the article in Chrome and just save to Instapaper
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.440]   and just forget about it.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.520]   Installing that app was just freaking game changing because I was also getting
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.000]   so distracted down these rabbit holes of these interesting articles.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.840]   But then I'd save them to Instapaper and I'd just go through them
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.200]   when I was like on a train or on a bus or on the toilet or something like that.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.080]   And the nice thing is, as I would follow links, you can click on a link
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.440]   and you can just save that link to Instapaper as well.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.320]   So as I go through binge reading someone's blog, I'd be saving all these articles.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.600]   And I've got this whole list of articles
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.840]   and it gets rid of the ads and it formats it really nicely.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.680]   Recently, I've started using an app called Reader by the guys who make Readwise.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.280]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   I'm not. So Readwise is sick.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.080]   Readwise.io/ali for extended trial and affiliate link.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.760]   Readwise is basically an app that connects to your Kindle account
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.240]   and imports everything you've ever highlighted.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.560]   And every day it sends you an email with five of your highlights.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.480]   And that's kind of cool.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.000]   It means you can revisit stuff that you've highlighted in books on Kindle.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.440]   But they've also now got this feature where they import all of your highlights
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.640]   from Instapaper and from Pocket and from these other read it later type apps.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.680]   So every morning, if you want, you can subscribe to the email
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.320]   where you get a digest of five random things
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.160]   you've highlighted at some point in a previous life.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.400]   And often I'll see things that are highlighted
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.920]   five years ago when I read this book.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.760]   And surprisingly, this highlight came to me at a reasonable time.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.200]   And that helps me keep ideas that I've highlighted in the past fresh on top of mind.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.280]   But the guys who make Readwise, I'm kind of mates with them.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.840]   We kind of became internet friends.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.880]   And I had one of them on the podcast.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.920]   We became internet friends through me just loving the app.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.800]   And they've built this new app called Reader, which is in beta.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.880]   And it's coming out like either August or September.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.840]   And it's basically like Superhuman, but for articles and PDFs
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.200]   and things that you want to read.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.440]   And it's amazing. So this Reader app in beta.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.280]   I've got the test flight version on iOS is currently how I consume everything.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.120]   I just save everything to it. It's great.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.440]   It's got like a Chrome highlighter.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.280]   It means that any time I'm reading anything,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.520]   whether it's a PDF or a blog post or an article or tweet thread,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.880]   just go straight into Reader.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.400]   And it means I can deal with it at a later date rather than it
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.520]   distracting me from whatever I'm doing in the moment.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.360]   Superhuman 4 is like a sucker hook for me, right?
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.280]   For anyone not listening, I think I've talked about Superhuman in the past.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.800]   I looked at my email and I had all these invitations.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.200]   So Superhuman is this replacement email interface for Gmail.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.160]   You schedule a call to get to know the product before you sign up
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.720]   because it costs, I think, about $20 a month.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.680]   All the hacks.com/superhuman affiliate link on my site
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.760]   for a free trial.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.160]   But I never did it because I never wanted to take the plunge
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.680]   because I was like, really, I'm going to pay for email like this is crazy.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.840]   And then finally, I was like, OK, I'm just going to try it
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.640]   because I do a lot of email.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.160]   And there was one feature I needed and Gmail didn't have it.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   And the feature, which is probably not important to that many people,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.600]   is I was wanted to look at emails I'd gotten from listeners
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.360]   and people and see all the other emails they've sent.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.840]   And Gmail has this feature, but it doesn't work if you have aliases.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.400]   So for my Gmail, I send from my personal email, my work email, all this stuff.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.000]   Gmail only works if that email came to or from the core Gmail account.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.800]   And Superhuman did the other thing.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.880]   And so what I wanted to be able to do is know if we've talked about something
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.320]   in the past and all that.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.520]   So I was like, I'm going to try it out.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.560]   And now it's like magical, right?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.000]   Like setting up different snippets to auto send things.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.600]   It's just like change to everything.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.840]   So when you say this is like Superhuman for this, I'm like, where's the link?
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.280]   I want to install it. I'm going to pay for it. It's great. What else?
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.640]   Yeah, I can hook you up with beta access if you'd like.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.880]   I can do an email intro to the guys. I think you'd really like it.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.840]   That would be great.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.000]   Are there other apps like that that have kind of changed your productivity
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.840]   stack make you operate more efficiently that are not the obvious?
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.680]   Yeah, I mean, I've tried dozens, if not hundreds over the years.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.560]   Part of being a productivity YouTuber is there is an incentive for me
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.720]   to try out every app on the market and maybe decide if I want to use it.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.240]   We use Notion for organizing basically everything in our business,
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.520]   all of our content production for YouTube videos and for podcasts
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.280]   and for Twitter threads and for everything.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.120]   I've recently started using Miro, M-I-R-O,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.640]   which is this interactive whiteboarding software.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.880]   Just gives you a blank canvas where you can put poster notes.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.120]   And that's really useful
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.400]   for like brainstorming and whiteboarding ideas for my book
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.560]   or for courses that we're working.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.640]   Honestly, like I haven't tried like dozens of these apps.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.280]   I just tend to default to Apple Notes.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.200]   If I want to write something down, it goes into Apple Notes
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.680]   and I don't think too hard about it.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.920]   So you use anything for task management?
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.240]   Yeah, I use Todoist, but it's kind of annoying.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   And so we're moving to Notion
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.320]   because I delegate a lot of things to my assistant times two.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.680]   So Todoist is kind of annoying for that.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.440]   So we're actually switching to Notion for task management.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.480]   So I use Notion for a lot, right?
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.880]   I have one Notion that's everything related to all the hacks.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   I have another Notion that's everything for our family.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.800]   Like we're planning a trip.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.960]   Where do we put the notes for it?
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Where do I log the flights?
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.760]   What are we looking at, you know, for our daughter?
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.960]   What is the baby registry?
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.040]   What do we need to go by?
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.120]   What is the schedule of doctor's appointments?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.240]   All this stuff.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.200]   So I'm a huge fan, but I find that getting information in and out of it
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.040]   is more like a project than like a quick, "Oh, I got to do this thing."
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   Throwing it into Notion isn't the easiest.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.800]   So how do you make that easy or is it just it's not easy,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   but it makes your life better, so you do it?
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.320]   Yeah, so I think my favorite task manager for iOS is Things 3.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.240]   It's just so nice.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.400]   The only problem is that it just doesn't work if you delegate things
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.120]   or if you have a team.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.600]   But if I was purely solo, Things 3 all the way.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.080]   Doist is a good cross-platform alternative.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.920]   It's free. It's on iOS, it's on Android, it's on Windows, etc.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.160]   And it's delegation.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.480]   Honestly, I think everyone should have a part-time personal assistant.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.080]   And that's an absolutely life-changing productivity hack.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.480]   So I do not have one.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.320]   And I've struggled in the past.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.440]   Five years ago, I tried.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.720]   What kinds of things do you have this person do?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.840]   And do you ever get too caught up in, "I want to make sure that they're doing them
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   the exact way I would do them."
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.360]   And then it ends up taking more time?
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.080]   Yeah, basically everything that I don't want to do myself.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.320]   So a lot of emails.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.760]   So my assistant, Dan, is remote, but he's based in the UK.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.960]   So we've met in real life, which I think is really useful.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.760]   A lot of people try and hire a VA in the Philippines for $5 an hour
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   and then they're surprised when it doesn't work.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.200]   But if you have the ability to hire someone
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.080]   that you can potentially work with in real life some of the time,
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.480]   or at least meet in person, it's just really nice.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.680]   But anyway, Dan basically goes through all my emails.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.840]   He deals with all my scheduling, things like scheduling this podcast, for example.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.400]   I have basically outsourced the management of my calendar to Dan.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.000]   So he deals with it.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.040]   And it means that as emails come in and stuff,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.080]   I'm actually not the first person to see an email.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.680]   I'll see the superhuman notification on my phone.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.480]   And if it's something like really interesting or really urgent,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.760]   then I'll reply to it there and then.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.800]   So yes, scheduling and emails is a big one.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.480]   But just beyond that, there's a lot of random admin tasks in life.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.600]   Like, for example, I knew I wanted to get a cleaner for the house.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.800]   Kind of a bit of a first world problem.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.000]   But like, I don't want to be the one calling up random cleaning
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.840]   agencies in London and trying to find a cleaner who can like be there
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.520]   at the same time that I want and do some of the ironing and change the sheets.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.800]   So I just said, Hey, Dan, can you find me a cleaner for the house?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.600]   Basically, if they can come in on a weekday morning
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.800]   and do all the things, including ironing, that's what I want.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.440]   And it was like, cool, I'll call around.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.320]   I'll ring a few agencies.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.880]   And he found someone and we've got a cleaner.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.040]   Things like I remember when I first got an assistant,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.880]   I was just sort of playing around to be like, huh,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.920]   what are all the things I could delegate?
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.040]   I was like, you know, I wanted to learn how to play the ukulele.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.600]   Her name was Elizabeth at the time.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.640]   I said, Hey, Elizabeth, can you find me a ukulele for under like 200 pounds
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.800]   and just find some reviews and just order it?
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.200]   And she was like, cool.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.880]   The next day, a ukulele arrived at my house.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.560]   I'd been procrastinating from, again, playing the ukulele for like two years
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.160]   because all it would have taken was for me to sit down and spend five minutes
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.880]   searching on the Internet for what's the best ukulele for a certain budget.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.400]   But it's in a way so much easier to be able to say that to an assistant
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.840]   or to a voice note that you can then send to an assistant.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.080]   Right now, Dan is hunting for a new property that we're moving into.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.280]   We're trying to move studio spaces,
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.760]   ringing up estate agents and dealing with booking viewings and arranging viewings.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.880]   Dan is doing all of that.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.760]   And he's just getting them to send us WhatsApp videos
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.920]   so that I can spend my time doing things that I actually want to be doing,
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.680]   like talking to you on this podcast or like making videos or like writing
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.440]   or things other than dealing with the hours and hours
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.320]   a bad minute takes to book viewings for a property in a market
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.840]   where properties are moving fast.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.800]   So almost anything within reason can be outsourced to an assistant.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.760]   Have you done a blog post
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.720]   or a video on how to use an assistant and all the tasks you could use for them?
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.400]   No, we're working on it.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.960]   I have this course idea in my mind that we've sort of fleshed out.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.760]   It's going to be called something like the life changing
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.320]   magic of a personal assistant.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.520]   And I want to make videos and blog posts and tweets
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.640]   and all of this stuff about it at some point soon.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.960]   And for someone who hasn't gone down the path of how much this could cost,
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.120]   you mentioned you could go to the Philippines.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:48.960]   It's super cheap.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.480]   You don't need someone full time, right?
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.760]   This is something you can start at a pretty low cost.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.960]   Yeah. Add a lot of scale.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.800]   Yeah. I've been telling all my friends four hours a week
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.160]   will completely change your life.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.480]   And if you can find someone local here in the UK, 15 pounds an hour.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.200]   So that's like 20 dollars an hour for four hours.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.960]   That's like 80 dollars a week.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.440]   And people are always like, oh, that's like 320 dollars a month.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.680]   That's so expensive.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.360]   OK, this is not for students who are broke.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.760]   It's for people who have real jobs.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.480]   It's like a what's your actual hourly rate?
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.200]   Like you're doing the whole Naval thing of like,
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.560]   what is your actual hourly rate?
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.960]   Should you really be the one to do this thing that you don't want to do?
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   But also the other way of thinking of it is like if you could free up
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.720]   four hours of your time to, for example, spend with your family,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.040]   how much would that be worth to you over the long term?
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.120]   It's like, OK, probably worth more than 20 dollars. Great.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.280]   So now that gives you an idea of how much it would potentially be worth
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.880]   hiring an assistant for.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.840]   I'm so bullish on the part time personal assistant thing.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.960]   I think it's great.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.920]   I got this email from someone this morning.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.400]   I'm going to butcher the name, but Lee Aaron.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.840]   And they were like, hey, can you do an episode on family life?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.600]   I know you've talked about it a little, but time.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.000]   How do I maximize my time?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.600]   So this is a great example to the Aaron who wrote in
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.960]   something to consider to buy back some time.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.080]   And I'm a big fan of buying time, like to the extent that you can find
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.280]   a person to do a thing that you don't want to do
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.640]   or not that you don't want to do.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.920]   I used to love cooking before kids.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.960]   Cooking was like in lieu of sitting on the couch, doing nothing.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.200]   And that trade off was good.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.560]   Now, cooking might be in lieu of spending time with your kids
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:15.160]   or working or doing these other things because you just have less time.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.920]   So it's not that I don't like it.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.720]   It's that I now have different priorities
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.520]   because there are more things on my plate.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.120]   And so whatever's at the bottom of that list, I find that we often
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.280]   are doing those things, even though we might not actually prioritize them
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.320]   because they have to happen.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.040]   But to the extent you can hire someone to cook or to clean
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.240]   or to do whatever task it is on your list.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.760]   It sounds like I need to test out one of these services.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.560]   Yeah, it's a it's a great experiment.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.680]   I keep procrastinating.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.000]   I got to get something very clear of what I'm going to do next.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.000]   So Chris, the next question I would ask you is when are you going to find a VA?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   So this is a great segue.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.360]   But before I want to hit one thing and then I want to jump to what
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.480]   I think will be a great way to answer this.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.920]   You mentioned you read a lot.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.080]   You save notes from Kindle.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.560]   You find them all over the place.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.040]   I've seen that you write a bunch about reading effectively and efficiently.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.120]   And so I want to wrap up the productivity thing with what you're doing there,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.880]   because I have a lot of books.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.560]   I enjoy reading them, but I don't think I'm doing it right.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.320]   And I know that sounds so ridiculous.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.200]   Like I know how to read the words on the page, but I feel like
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.840]   if you've written posts and made videos about reading effectively and efficiently,
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.480]   I'm confident that there's a way I can do it better.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.960]   Hmm. So do you read on physical book or Kindle or what's your jam?
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.200]   To be honest, I a lot of times get the e-book,
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.360]   but I sometimes really prefer the physical book, but I could do both.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.280]   I'm not like wedded to one or the other, but I am not good at audio books,
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.440]   despite being great at podcasts.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.040]   I don't know.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.080]   I feel like whenever I'm listening to an audio book, sometimes I get distracted.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.520]   And then I realize, oh, I missed the last five minutes.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.960]   And if I try to not be distracted and I just like lie in bed to listen,
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.160]   then I find that, you know, I might fall asleep or something.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.640]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.160]   Another question I would ask, and maybe you can answer
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.400]   like what your listeners would be thinking about this is like,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.240]   why do you want to read more effectively?
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.120]   Like, what's the point?
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.640]   Retention, I read a lot of things and I learn these fascinating things,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.160]   especially when I'm reading books that people I'm interviewing have written.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.240]   I want to remember those things, not just for five minutes,
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.520]   not just for the day I want to process them.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.880]   And then to the extent they're a way to read faster or more efficiently,
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.640]   they're kind of like efficiently, maybe effectively.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.720]   It's like effectively, I retain the information efficiently.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.560]   It just happens faster.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   Yeah, sure. Have you come across building a second brain?
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.360]   So I'm going back and forth with Tiago,
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.960]   who will come on the show a little later this year.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.640]   I took his course in like 2019, 2020, something like that.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.200]   And that introduced me to a lot of ideas around retention of stuff
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.240]   and taking information and doing useful things with it.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's a fairly expensive course, but the book covers all of the things
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.640]   and the book is, you know, the price of a book.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.680]   But broadly, I think the easy hack, we're all about hacks here
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.880]   for remembering stuff is to basically use Readwise.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.520]   I have yet to find an app that is better than Readwise at this,
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.360]   which if you're highlighting things on Kindle, it automatically files them.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.200]   It also has like an app where you can literally scan the text of a book
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.240]   as you're reading it, if you want a thing, and it will OCR
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.200]   recognize the characters and will recognize what book it's from
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.680]   and will just categorize it automatically.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.440]   And then just by virtue of reading that email every day of like five highlights,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.160]   five things that have resonated enough with you for you to want to highlight.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.760]   I found that to be genuinely the single biggest thing
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.000]   that has changed the game in terms of my retention of ideas.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.640]   And people was like, oh, you know, when you're on podcasts,
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.480]   how are you able to cite all these sources and these books and quotes and stuff?
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.640]   So I was like, look at the Readwise email once in a while.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.560]   And it just kind of resurfaces the quotes.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.600]   That's like, I think, the basic level that does most of the good stuff.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.120]   To make sure I got that, if you scan the page of a physical book,
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.240]   look, I mean, Apple now has this live text, right?
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.360]   You could just copy and paste the text, but this actually knows what book it is
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.400]   and will actually store that information also.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.080]   There may be an intermediate step where it connects to your Amazon account
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.880]   and it therefore knows what book you own.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.760]   And sometimes you have to like type in the name of the title or something.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.120]   But yeah, it's pretty magical when it works.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.240]   There is an intermediate step when that particular thing doesn't work.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.360]   So that would be how I'd do the whole retention thing broadly.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.920]   The actual way of retaining anything is to find a way
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.000]   to use that information in your day to day life,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.640]   maybe to create a piece of content or something or other based around that.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.440]   So if a book really, really resonated with me, I've got loads of highlights for it.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.080]   I will try and write a book summary or write like a tweet thread summary
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.400]   of a book or make a video about the book or interview the author of the book
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.840]   and talk to them about the book.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.560]   Just some kind of output that creates this tangible thing,
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.960]   which is a reason to actually bother retaining the stuff,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.200]   because it's all well and good saying, I really want to remember what's in this book.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.400]   But if I'm not creating anything from it, it's going to be hard
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.320]   beyond looking at my Readwise email every day.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.360]   So for me, it's easy because I do videos about books
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.520]   and that helps me remember a lot of the things.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.160]   Readwise also synchronizes to Notion.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   And so I've got a Notion page that has literally everything
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.480]   I've ever highlighted in my life on Kindle or Instapaper or Reader or Pocket
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.720]   or any other app I've used to read books or read articles.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.160]   And so if I ever need ideas for videos, I'll just look through my highlights
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.560]   and be like, cool, that's a cool idea.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.120]   That's from that book. All right, cool.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.080]   Let's piece things together and turn it into a video.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.120]   Nick Gray was on the show a couple weeks ago and talked about Friends newsletter.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.920]   So I'd say if you need a way to take the interesting content you're consuming,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.560]   I can promise you that most people, at least I do from your newsletter,
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.360]   find interesting.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.480]   Oh, here's this app I checked out. Here's this book I read.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.840]   Here's this thing I found.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.680]   And so he proposed that everyone start a Friends newsletter.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.200]   That's just, you know, send your friends an email,
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.960]   whether it's weekly, monthly, quarterly.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.280]   And I feel like that would be a great place to put this stuff and reinforce it,
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.320]   which will help you remember it.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.360]   So there's one tip from that episode. Nice.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.200]   OK, I always try to wrap these conversations up
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.160]   where I ask everyone I interview to pick a city they know well,
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.080]   maybe London for you, and give people a suggestion of where to go for a meal,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.800]   have a drink, something unusual to do that isn't the obvious.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.560]   Nice. So I would actually go for Cambridge.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.680]   So I spent nine years in Cambridge, which is just an hour north of London.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.520]   That's where I went to university, where I worked as a doctor
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.000]   and where I spent a year of pandemic trying to grow my YouTube channel.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.960]   The nice thing to do in Cambridge is go punting.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.240]   You get these little boats, you sort of get this rod
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.440]   and you sort of pull yourself along the river with a rod.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.480]   And it's super nice when the weather is good.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.480]   And then there's this cafe called Fitzbillies,
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.880]   which does a really good afternoon tea.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.040]   You can have tea with scones and jam and clotted cream.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.560]   And it's a very nice British type thing.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   And you like punt along the river
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.200]   and then you have your tea and scones in Fitzbillies.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.000]   And it's a great vibe. Fantastic day out with the family.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.600]   That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.000]   Last thing, where should people find everything you're working on online?
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.760]   Yeah, so probably my website, Ali Abdaal.com or my YouTube channel.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.400]   If you just search Ali Abdaal or Ali or something on YouTube, it'll come up.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.080]   Awesome. I'll link to all that.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   And we got a lot of links from this episode in the show notes.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.440]   Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:47.160]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.920]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.240]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   Podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi,
