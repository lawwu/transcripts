[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   How are these interacting with our fighters if they are?
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.760]   How are they interacting with the weather
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.000]   and their environment?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   How are they interacting with each other?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.720]   So can we look at these
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.520]   and how they're interacting perhaps as a swarm,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   especially off the East Coast
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.480]   where this is happening all the time with multiple objects?
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.200]   - The following is a conversation
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.040]   with Lieutenant Ryan Graves, former Navy fighter pilot,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080]   including roles as a combat lead,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.480]   landing signals officer, and rescue mission commander.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760]   He and people in his squadron detected UFOs
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   on multiple occasions.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.960]   And he has been one of the few people
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.680]   willing to speak publicly about these experiences
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280]   and about the importance of investigating these sightings,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.520]   especially for national security reasons.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.600]   Ryan has a degree in mechanical
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.320]   and aerospace engineering from WPI
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.560]   and an interest in career roles
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.440]   in advanced technology development,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.560]   including multi-agent collaborative autonomy,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   machine learning assisted air-to-air combat,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.240]   manned and unmanned teaming technologies,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.840]   and most recently, development of materials
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.200]   through quantum simulation.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.280]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.440]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.800]   in the description.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.160]   And now, dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   What did you think of the new "Top Gun" movie?
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.720]   How accurate was it?
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.960]   Let's start there.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.640]   - I thought the flying was really accurate.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.280]   I thought the type of flying they did
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.440]   and how they approached the actual mission,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.400]   of course, had a lot of liberties.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.480]   But one thing that seems to be hard to capture
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.520]   on these types of things are the chess game
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.400]   that's going on while that type of flying is happening.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.920]   - The chess game between, like in a dogfight,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.520]   between the pilots and the enemy,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.440]   or between the different pilots?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.520]   - I'll even speak to just that particular mission
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.360]   they flew there.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.200]   And for that particular mission,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   it's kind of a chess game with yourself
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.480]   to get everything in place.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.080]   So what kind of flight they flew
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840]   is called a high threat scenario,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.920]   which means they have to ingress low
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.120]   due to the surface to air threats,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.040]   the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.720]   And they have to ingress low and pop up
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.320]   like we see in the movie.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.920]   And in that particular movie, that was a pre-planned strike.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.640]   They knew exactly where they were going.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   But there's a scenario where we have to operate
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   in that type of environment,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.720]   and we don't know exactly where we're gonna strike,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   or we're gonna be adapting to real-time targets.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   And so in that scenario, you would have one of those fighters
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.760]   down low like that, operating as a mission commander,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.320]   as a forward air controller.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   And he's out there calling shots,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560]   joining on those other players
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.680]   in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.760]   So that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.800]   - Can you actually describe,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.600]   for people who haven't seen the movie,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.440]   what the mission actually is?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   - Yeah.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   - What's involved in the mission?
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   - So in this particular mission,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520]   it's kind of what we would call a pre-planned strike.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   So there's a known location
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.360]   that's in a heavily defended area.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.520]   And the air crew, in this case,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   I believe it was four F-18s on the initial package,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.560]   their job was to ingress very low down a canyon
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.200]   to stay out of the radar window of the surf to air threats.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.720]   - What does ingress mean?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   - Ingress means that they're going to be pushing
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.000]   from a start location towards a target or the objective.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.040]   So there's an ingress portion of the mission
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.480]   and an egress portion of the mission.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840]   - Oh, okay.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.160]   Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.000]   Got it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.520]   - But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.000]   'Cause when we're entering someplace,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.880]   we have the option to enter.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.320]   But when we go drop a bomb on a location we're exiting,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.760]   we don't have that luxury, we don't have that option.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.440]   So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.280]   - Got it.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.360]   And so they were flying low to the ground
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.840]   and then there's a surface to air missiles
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.160]   that force them to have to fly low.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.600]   Is that a realistic thing?
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.760]   - It is realistic.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.860]   So driving those aircraft in the clutter,
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.920]   all radar systems or most I should say
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   are essentially line of sight.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.160]   And so they're gonna be limited by the horizon
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.640]   or any clutter out there.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.520]   And even a number of radars,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.860]   if they are located up high and looking down
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.400]   towards that aircraft, the clutter,
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.460]   all the objects such as trees and canyons
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.520]   can have effect on radar systems.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.280]   And so it can be a type of camouflage.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.840]   - So that's the camouflage for the radar,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   but what about the surface to air missile?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.240]   Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   as flies solo, like fly I guess below their level?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.440]   - As far as I know, you can fly under any radar right now.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   We don't have necessarily radars
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.900]   that can look through anything.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.620]   So there is always gonna be the ability to mask yourself.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.400]   But with a larger number of assets
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.680]   and distributed communication networks,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.520]   where those radars are looking
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.480]   makes all the difference.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.000]   And I said they're ingressing pass an IADS
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.940]   and that's an integrated air defense system.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.560]   And that linking of air defense systems
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.920]   is what makes it so hard, so complicated
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.540]   is that the sensors and the weapons
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.380]   are disassociated from each other.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.800]   So that if you took out the target
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   that was shooting at you,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.120]   it still has ability to intercept you
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.440]   from another radar location.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.920]   So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   - You mean the surface to air missiles,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.840]   like it's a distributed system
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.680]   in that if you take out one,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.040]   they're still able to sort of integrate information
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.280]   about your location and strike at you.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.100]   - Correct.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.120]   And there's a lot of complication that can go
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.440]   once we start thinking about distributed systems like that
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.520]   and the ability to self heal and repair
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.600]   and adapt to losses.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.880]   It's an interesting area.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   - Are you responsible for thinking about that
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.480]   when you're flying an airplane?
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.120]   - To some degree.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.040]   When we ingress to an area like that,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   we're presented with information about targets,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   air to air or air to surface,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.040]   or surface to air, I should say.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.680]   And we can essentially see where essentially
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.400]   the danger zone, if you will, is located.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.320]   And so essentially we would stay out of that.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.880]   And so having a full picture of the environment
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.440]   is extremely important because at the end of the day,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.480]   if we go in that circle, we can die pretty quickly.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.720]   So it's absolutely crucial.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.280]   - So there's regions that have higher and lower danger
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.880]   based on your understanding of the actual,
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.040]   whatever the surface to air missile systems are.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.200]   So you can kind of know.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.080]   That's interesting.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.880]   I wonder how automated that could be too,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.360]   especially when you don't know.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.800]   It seems like in the movie they knew
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.120]   the location of everything.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.440]   I imagine that's less known in most cases.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.120]   And also a lot of those systems might be
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.560]   a little bit more ghetto, if I can use that technical term.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   Like I've gotten ad hoc maybe is the, I don't know.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.320]   But having just recently visited Ukraine
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.080]   there's a lot of improvised type of systems.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.840]   So you take high tech, like advanced technology,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.200]   but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   is very improvised and ad hoc and is responding
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   to the uncertainty in the dynamic environment.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.840]   And so from an enemy perspective
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.720]   or whoever's trying to deal with that kind of system,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.240]   it's hard to figure it out because it's like me.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.040]   I played tennis for a long time
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.800]   and it's always easier to play, this is true for all sports,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.360]   play tennis against a good tennis player
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.200]   versus a crappy tennis player.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.440]   'Cause the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.280]   And that's really difficult to deal with.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.400]   It seemed like in the movie
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.160]   the systems were really well organized.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   And so you could plan.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.920]   - And there's a very nice ravine
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.400]   that went right down the middle of them.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.840]   That's how movies work, isn't it?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.680]   - Yeah.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   But no, I absolutely agree.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.560]   So what you say is a very good point.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.520]   And as if we were to take a chunk of airspace
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.360]   and break it up into little bits,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.040]   there'd be places that are better to fly
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   or less good to fly.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.640]   And we are seeing that now
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.280]   with what they call manned unmanned teaming.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.520]   We see tactical aircraft or some type of aircraft
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.160]   or platform that's being automated.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.560]   And it's not being automated in traditional sense
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.520]   where people think air crew are flying them around
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.360]   to conduct missions,
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.200]   but it's very high level objective-orientated
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.600]   mission planning that allows the air crew
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   to act more as a mission planner, mission commander
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.560]   versus having to just pick the right assets
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   or fly them around or manipulate them somewhat physically.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   - So actually going back to the chess thing,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.840]   can you elaborate on what you mean
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   playing a game of chess with yourself?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.320]   What's, when you're flying that mission,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.720]   what exactly do you mean by that?
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.080]   - Well, there's a few people you're usually fighting against
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.040]   in the air.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.160]   There's the bad guys
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.320]   and then there's physics and mother nature, right?
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.440]   So when we're down at about 100 feet,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.240]   and it's a chess game for the wizard
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.600]   to process the information he needs
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.840]   and then communicate it to all those other aircraft
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.400]   that were flying around to ensure
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   that they're putting their weapons on the right target.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.520]   - What's the wizard?
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.320]   - Wizard is a weapons systems officer.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.560]   He's a backseater who is not a pilot,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.000]   but they're responsible for radar manipulation
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.880]   and communications and weapons deployments of certain natures.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.180]   - So the chess game is against physics, against the enemy.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.720]   - Time.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.640]   - Time.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.120]   What about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.960]   - No.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.240]   (both laughing)
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.320]   No, there's no time for that type of self-reflection
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.280]   while we're flying.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.560]   I wanna get to that,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   but I don't wanna forget the point that you made
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.280]   about increased randomness being a tactical advantage.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.800]   As you mentioned, you can introduce autonomy into there
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.960]   and when you bring autonomy in there,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.200]   and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.560]   and machine learning, as we gather more data,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.720]   we're gonna be able to bring the tactical environment
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.120]   around that jet, that the war space that it goes into
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.000]   will almost be at a stochastic level
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.200]   from the enemy's perspective,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.320]   where it'll almost seem like every tactical environment
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.760]   they go in will be random and yet very deadly
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   because the system is providing a new tactical solution,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.040]   essentially, for that particular scenario,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.960]   instead of just training to particular tactics
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.940]   that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.320]   But not necessarily the most lethal
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.280]   because they have to be trainable.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   But if we can introduce AI into that
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.800]   and to have a level of randomness
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.120]   or at least the appearance of randomness
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.220]   due to the complexity,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.160]   I would consider it like a stochastic tactical advantage
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.600]   because even our own blue fighters
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.960]   wouldn't be able to engage in that fight
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.680]   because it would be unsafe, essentially, for anything else.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.560]   And I think that's where we have to drive to
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.360]   because otherwise, it's always this chicken and mouse
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.920]   cat game about who's tactics and who knows what.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.680]   But if knowledge is no longer a factor,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.480]   it's gonna make things a lot different.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.320]   - That's really interesting.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   So out of the many things that are part of your expertise,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.760]   your journey, you're also working on autonomous
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.280]   and semi-autonomous systems,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.640]   the use of AI and machine learning
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.160]   and manned-on-man teaming, all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.000]   We'll talk about it.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.080]   But you're saying, sort of, when people think about
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.560]   the use of AI in war, in military systems,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.940]   they think about computer vision for perception
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.720]   or processing of sensor information
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   in order to extract from it actionable knowledge
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.560]   kind of thing.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   But you're saying you could also use it
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   to generate randomness that's difficult to work with
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.880]   in a game-theoretic way.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.520]   Like, it's difficult for human operators to respond to.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.440]   - Exactly.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.460]   - That's really interesting.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.800]   Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.440]   What about the dogfighting?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   What aspects of that were accurate?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.160]   - So dogfighting is kind of an interesting conversation
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.200]   because it's not the most tactically relevant
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.680]   skill set nowadays by traditional standards
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.080]   because the ranges with which we engage
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.240]   and employ weapons are very significant.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.940]   And so if we're in a scenario where we're in a dogfight
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.560]   like that, a lot of things have probably gone wrong, right?
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.880]   And that's kind of how this mission was set up, right?
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.840]   It was a no-win type scenario, most likely.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.720]   And so for a dogfight, the aircraft size and the ranges
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.000]   and the turn radiuses make it so it's not very theatrical.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.380]   The aircraft looks small, and while it's intense
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.520]   with the systems I have and the sensors
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.160]   and what I'm feeling and all that,
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.480]   we've done it and we've done it, right?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.760]   We take video of that and it's just like a blue sky
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.800]   and you see a little dot out there.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.760]   So not very interesting.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.960]   And so anytime it really looks interesting
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   in dogfight arena, that's most likely fiction
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.160]   'cause we really only get close for a millisecond
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.960]   as we're zipping past each other at the merge.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.120]   - You're breaking my heart, right?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.320]   - I know, I'm sorry. - You're breaking my heart.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.160]   No, I understand.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.480]   - In a dogfight, you can go out and have fun,
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.360]   but in a dogfight specifically.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.720]   - Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars,
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.760]   the World War II and before that,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   where the, is it due to the sort of the range
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.120]   - Correct. - Basically.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.720]   - And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   But there's also a train of thought
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.000]   that hasn't necessarily been tested out yet,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.640]   which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.120]   EW and or unmanned assets,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.320]   the battle space may get so complex
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.600]   and missiles may essentially just get dropped
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.360]   out of the sky or wasted such that you're gonna be in close
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.480]   with either IR missiles or guns,
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.920]   if it's a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.880]   - First of all, what's electronic warfare?
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.520]   - You know, it's basically trying to get control
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.600]   of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.960]   of whatever operation is going on.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.480]   So in the tactical environment,
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.600]   a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.920]   or can we deceive the missile or just, you know,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.960]   stop their guy and things of that nature.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.820]   - Man, it's a battle in the space of information,
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.920]   of digital information.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   - Yeah, well, F-22 and F-35, right?
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.680]   F-22 is a big expensive aircraft
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.100]   and it was made to be a great fighter.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.340]   But the F-35 is not as great of a fighter,
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.880]   but it's an electronic warfare
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.600]   and mission commander platform of the future,
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.840]   where information is what's gonna win the war
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.200]   instead of the best dogfighter.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.080]   And so it's interesting dichotomy there.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.440]   - What's the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.520]   - I know the aviators in the audience
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.080]   are gonna hate my answer because they're gonna want
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.320]   that sexy, you know, muscly F-14 Tomcat type fighter
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.120]   or maybe P-51 type aircraft,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.620]   but the F-35 is maybe not the best dogfighter,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.960]   but it doesn't have to get in a dogfight, right?
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.580]   It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters,
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.380]   not getting a knife fight sometimes.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.540]   - Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.900]   It looks pretty sexy.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.740]   - There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.300]   You can have the ability to kind of outmuscle your fighter,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.540]   your opponent and beat them on Gs and power
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.900]   and raid around on them.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.700]   And then there's the other side of that,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.720]   which is you can be overly maneuverable.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.060]   You can bleed energy quickly.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.140]   And that's what the F-18 was good at
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.820]   because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carrier.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.740]   We had to give it extra bulk,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.460]   but it also needs special mechanisms to slow down enough
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.500]   to land on aircraft carrier.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.060]   And so it made it very maneuverable.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.660]   And what that leads to a lot of times,
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.460]   the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.620]   which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.220]   you're gonna bleed a lot of your energy away
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.180]   and be more susceptible for follow on shots
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.660]   if that one's less susceptible.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.220]   And so there's just kind of aggression, non-aggression game
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.600]   you can play depending on the type
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.900]   of aircraft you're fighting.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.560]   - Where does the F-35 land on that spectrum?
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.640]   - The F-35 lands somewhere behind the F-22s.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.540]   So there'll probably be a row of F-22s or F-18s
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.920]   and F-35 will be out back,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.600]   but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.440]   that's happening in front of it.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.700]   - Is it one of the more expensive planes
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.280]   because of all the stuff on it?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.520]   - It certainly is, yeah.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.800]   - In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly it over Mach 10.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.080]   So maybe, can you say what are the different speeds
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.360]   accelerations feel like Mach one, two, three, or hypersonic?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   Have you ever flown hypersonic?
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.240]   - No.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.160]   - How tough does it get?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.080]   - I'm just gonna call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.440]   just for the record, 'cause in the movie,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.760]   there's been, I think, at least one ejection
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.520]   that was supersonic.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.000]   I'll just say, you know, it was not pretty,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.320]   but he survived.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.560]   So there would have to be some interesting mechanisms
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.320]   to eject successfully at Mach 10,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.100]   but I'll digress on that for the moment.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.480]   - Yeah, that seemed very strange.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.960]   - And he just walked away from it.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.240]   Anyway, so, you know--
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.400]   - He seemed disheveled.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.080]   (laughing)
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.920]   Okay, it's Tom Cruise.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.840]   It's like Chuck Norris or something.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.680]   - Indestructible, yeah.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.760]   - Indestructible. - That's what it was in age.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   - Yeah, but anyway, so what's interesting to say
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.400]   about the experience as you go up?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.560]   Does it get more and more difficult?
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.240]   - In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.480]   is much like crossing the speed limit on the highway.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.160]   You don't really notice anything.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.960]   To cross that, at least in F-18,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.840]   'cause we have a lot more weight than most fighters,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.400]   is typically we'll do that in a descent.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   We'll do that full afterburner,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   just dumping gas into the engine.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.400]   And so that'll get us over the fastest I think I've gone,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.240]   was about 1.28.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.600]   But what's interesting, people don't realize,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.560]   is that if I take that throttle in an afterburner
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.140]   and I just bring it back, just bring it back to mil,
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.680]   which is full power, just not afterburner,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.720]   the deacceleration is so strong due to the air friction
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.680]   that it'll throw you forward in your straps.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.560]   Almost, I would say, maybe like 70% as strong almost
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.600]   as trapping on the boat, it's pretty strong.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.920]   So it's almost like a reverse car crash
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.960]   just for the deacceleration.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.400]   So the acceleration is usually kind of slow
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.560]   and you don't feel anything of course
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.800]   when you're crossing through it,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.980]   but the deacceleration's pretty violent.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.320]   - The deceleration's violent, huh?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.840]   Okay.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.440]   But is there a fundamental difference
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.400]   between Mach 1 and hypersonic, Mach 5 and so on?
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.960]   Does it require super special training?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.680]   And is that something that's used often in warfare
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   or is it not really that necessary?
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.920]   - No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.200]   is not something that's employed tactically
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.000]   in any sense right now that I'm aware of.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.240]   So, you know, when I think of hypersonic technology,
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.960]   I think of missiles and weapon systems
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.840]   and delivery platform.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.040]   I don't think of fighter aircraft necessarily.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.640]   I can think of bomber or reconnaissance aircraft perhaps,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.000]   but those would be more efficient, very long, long range.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.320]   I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.360]   - The thing you experience is the acceleration,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.640]   not the actual speed.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.520]   There's been just a small tangent,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.480]   a lot of discussion about hypersonic nuclear weapons,
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.320]   like missiles from Russia, bragging about that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.720]   Is this something that's a significant concern
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.920]   or is it just a way to flex
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.720]   about different kinds of weapon systems?
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.520]   - Hypersonics, I do think, pose a challenge
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.880]   for our detection systems because there are,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.160]   you know, there are design considerations
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   in these sensor systems as always, right?
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.480]   When you build them and the technology progresses
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.040]   to a point where maybe it's not feasible
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.000]   to use that technology, you know, there's a problem.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.160]   But with the, you know, the all domain
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.200]   and kind of cross domain data linking capabilities we have,
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   it's less of, you know,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   it's more of a integrated picture, I'll say.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.320]   And so the hypersonics are really,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.920]   what it is is how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.040]   And you're just shortening the time available to do that.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.880]   We call something like that the kill chain, right?
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.960]   It's from locating a target and identifying it
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.200]   and, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   by whatever means, employing,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.320]   and then actually following up to ensure
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.280]   that you did what you said you were going to do
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.120]   in some sense, right?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.320]   Does it need another re-attack, something of that nature.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.880]   And so there's an old dog fighting framework you could call
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.920]   and it's called the OODA loop that kind of made its way
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.460]   in the engineering of business now,
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.760]   but the old observe, orientate, decide, act
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.320]   was initially a fighter mechanism
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.240]   in order to get inside that kill chain of your opponent
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.320]   and break it up so that he can't process
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.160]   his kill chain on you.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.760]   And so hypersonics are a way of shortening
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.240]   those windows of opportunity to react to that.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.760]   - I wondered to what, like how much do you have to shorten
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.280]   it in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.800]   It seems like it's very, you know,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.120]   I'm both often horrified by the thought of nuclear war,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.880]   but at the same time wonder what that looks like.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.080]   When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.560]   can reach the United States by missile
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.040]   with the defense systems.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.880]   - Defense systems.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.720]   - Defense systems.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.200]   But then again, I also understand
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.960]   that these are extremely complicated systems,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.800]   the amount of integration required.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.760]   And because you're not using them,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.080]   I mean, this is, there could be, you know,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.760]   there's like an intern somewhere
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.980]   that like forgot to update the code,
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.120]   the Fortran code that like is going to be,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.640]   make the different, because you don't have the opportunity
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   to really thoroughly test, which is really scary.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.200]   Of course, the systems are probably incredible
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.440]   if they could be tested,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.640]   because they can't be really thoroughly tested
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   in an actual attack, I wonder.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.840]   - I guess one assumption there would be that
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.800]   these hypersonic missiles would only be launched
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.100]   and the case would attack.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.960]   It'd be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.840]   that we could use to flex those systems.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.280]   - Another thing that actually happened,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.200]   I just have a million questions I want to ask you,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   it's fascinating to me,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.520]   is there's a bird strike on the plane.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.680]   Does that happen often?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.520]   - Yeah, it's a serious issue.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   - And it damaged the engine
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.920]   and they made it seem like it's a serious,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.220]   exactly a serious issue.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.560]   - I've hit birds.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.480]   I know someone that took a turkey vulture to the face
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.840]   through the cockpit, right?
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.560]   Shattered the cockpit, knocked him out.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.640]   I think that, actually, I don't know him personally,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.920]   but as a story I know from the command I was at,
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.520]   and I believe the back seater had to punch out
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.480]   and punch them both out, 'cause he was unconscious,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.040]   you know, in the front seat from the bird.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.280]   It can kill you from hitting you.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.300]   It's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.440]   It can take out an engine very easily.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.880]   Every airport I've flown at in the Navy,
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.080]   I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.360]   to see how many birds.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.520]   We've had to cancel flights
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.800]   because there's too many of them around the airport.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.200]   Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.920]   - Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.880]   - There is, yeah.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   There's actual radar systems
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.920]   and you can go in the certain bases,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.440]   you have to call up and they'll tell you what it is
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.840]   for the day or for that hour,
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.440]   and other ones have it in their weather report
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.760]   that goes out over the radio.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.880]   - What are some technological solutions to this?
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   Or is this just because it's a low probability event,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   there's no real solution for it?
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.280]   - I would say it's not a low probability event.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.840]   This is happening a lot.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.960]   Although the hits themselves aren't necessarily that common,
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.640]   or I'll say a catastrophic hit,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.740]   either a near miss or a hit,
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.880]   or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.040]   is pretty common.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.880]   And in fact--
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.700]   - It seems stressful.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.480]   - It is, it's so common in fact that we know
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.240]   that you never wanna try to go over,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.700]   or you never wanna go under a bird
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.140]   if you see it in front of you.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.240]   You always wanna try to go over it
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.480]   because what they'll do immediately if they see you is,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.320]   and you startle them,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.880]   is they'll bring their wings in and just drop straight down
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.060]   to try to get out of the path.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.600]   It's interesting, I didn't know they did that.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.280]   But so if you try to go under them,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   they're gonna be dropping into you.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.840]   So you typically wanna try to go above them.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.040]   - Is this something you can train for or no?
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.940]   - Is this one of those things you have to really experience?
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:55.080]   - It's a skill set that you somewhat train for
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.460]   in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.460]   Being able to react to your environment very quickly
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.580]   and make decisions quickly, so.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.340]   - Is that one of the more absurd things,
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.620]   challenges you have to deal with in flying?
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.620]   Is there other things, sort of maybe weather conditions,
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.740]   like harsh weather conditions?
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.540]   Is there something that we maybe don't often think about
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.100]   in terms of the challenges of flying?
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.380]   - Birds in a way, aren't a ridiculous threat for us.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.380]   It's a safety threat that, anything physical in the air,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.440]   is it's something that we really have to be careful about.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.500]   Whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.260]   right next to us, or whether it's a turkey vulture
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.340]   at 2000 feet or a flock of 5000 birds,
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.620]   like at the runway and we have to wave off, you know?
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.760]   And although they're low probability,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.500]   a lot of bases will have like actual
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.200]   environmental protecting agency employees
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.760]   that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.560]   or different animals that may be in the runways
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.320]   or flying about.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.280]   - Wow, I didn't know what a turkey vulture is
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.800]   and it really does look like a mix between a vulture
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.640]   and a turkey.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.480]   - Yeah, they're huge.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.220]   - And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.400]   In that movie, who was the enemy nation?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.080]   Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it's Iran.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.040]   Or was it Russia?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.120]   - I didn't think they were implying
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.960]   any particular nation state, frankly.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.000]   I think they did a somewhat decent job
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.220]   of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.380]   The location and the stockpile,
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.240]   like I get how the story kind of insinuates certain things,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.360]   but they seemed to do a good job of not having anything
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.800]   directly pointing to another nation,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.880]   which I thought was the good move.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.080]   I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.320]   and as an American, right?
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.460]   'Cause it's a feel good movie,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.960]   but we shouldn't be celebrating going to war
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.400]   with any particular country, China, Russia,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.760]   whoever may have these weapons.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.320]   It's fun to watch, but it would be an incredibly serious
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.840]   event to be employing these weapons.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.040]   - Yeah, and we'll talk about war in general,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.200]   because yeah, the movie's kind of celebrating
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.000]   the human side of things
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.920]   and also the incredible technology involved,
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.400]   but there's also the cost of war
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.840]   and the seriousness of war
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.040]   and the suffering involved with war,
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.640]   not just in the fighting, but in the death of civilians
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.140]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.840]   Well, you were a Navy pilot.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.800]   Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   And you were twice deployed in the Middle East
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.040]   flying the F/A-18F Super Hornet.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.260]   Can you briefly tell the story of your career
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.400]   as a Navy pilot?
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.240]   - Sure.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.000]   So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.960]   I went to essentially the officer bootcamp,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.320]   officer candidate school.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.300]   I applied as a pilot and I got in as a pilot.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.920]   That was the advantage of going that way
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.720]   is that I could essentially choose what I wanted,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.800]   and if I got in, great.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.560]   If not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.000]   - So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.400]   - I did.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.360]   I joined, I went through my initial training.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.160]   I went through primary flight training
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.960]   that all aviators go through,
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.520]   and I did well enough that,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.760]   you know, one of the first lessons
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   they teach you in the Navy is that,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.300]   you know, you can have a great career in the Navy
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.080]   and you can, you know, see the world and do what you want,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.920]   but at the end of the day,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.640]   it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they need.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.160]   So, you know, they may not have the platform you like,
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.460]   or, you know, you may not necessarily get
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.680]   to choose your own adventure here.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   But I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   in my class and I was lucky enough,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.880]   fortunate enough to get it.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.720]   So.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.640]   - It was a jet slot.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.380]   - So, well, yeah, what that means is that
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.760]   I was assigned actually tail hook at that point,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.440]   which meant I would go train to fly aircraft
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.520]   that land on aircraft carriers.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.800]   And there's essentially three aircraft that do that
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   at the time, it was the F-18 and the E-2 and the C-2.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   C-2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.160]   E-2 is one of the big radar dish on top.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.640]   And then there's all the F-18s.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.440]   - So, E-2 is comms, is C-2 mail truck?
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.280]   - Yeah.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.120]   - What's that?
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.520]   - C-2 basically is basically all the mail.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.480]   They literally bring them to shore
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.700]   and they're the ones that bring supplies
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.400]   to the ship via air and people.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.960]   - Sorry if I missed it, is it a plane or is it a helicopter?
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.800]   - It's a plane.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.920]   - Okay.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.840]   All right, and the F-18 is a fighter jet.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.680]   - Correct.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.500]   - Okay.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.600]   - So, I selected tail hook, which meant I could get
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.120]   one of those other ones, but 80% or so are jets.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.880]   So, I was in a good spot at that point.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.520]   And that's when I went to Myrtie, Mississippi
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.120]   to fly my first jet, which was the T-45, "Gaashawk."
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.200]   - Cool, so what kind of plane is that?
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.160]   Is that what you were doing your training on?
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.800]   - That's the jet aircraft you get in
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.520]   before you actually go to the F-18.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.400]   It is carrier capable, so go to the boat
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.560]   for the first time in it during the day,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   drop fake bombs, do dog fighting, low levels,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.480]   formation flying day and night.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.280]   - Well, it's a pretty plane.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.880]   - Yeah, and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.400]   (both laugh)
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.360]   - Okay, so it's usually not used for fighting,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.400]   it's used for training?
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.960]   - It's used for training how to fight.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.080]   - Got it, so what was that like?
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.160]   Was that the first time you were
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.200]   sort of really getting into it?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.280]   - Yeah, that was really interesting,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.320]   'cause before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.440]   And going from that to the T-45
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.080]   is one of the biggest jumps in power
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.520]   in like Navy machine operation.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.080]   - How much horsepower does the T-45 have approximately?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.000]   - I don't know, like 15,000 or so.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.920]   - So, it's a huge jump from 600,
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.280]   you said horsepower about?
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.320]   - Yeah. - Cool, so it's a big,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.480]   big leap.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.720]   But it's a jet, you know,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.320]   so it performs differently, it's faster, right?
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.240]   What that means, not just 'cause it's faster,
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.400]   your whole mind needs to be faster.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.240]   Everything happens faster in the air now, right?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   Those comms happen faster,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   your landing gear has to come up faster,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.880]   everything just happens faster in a jet.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.240]   And so it's a big jump.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.440]   And I'll never forget going on my first flight
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.360]   in that aircraft, it was a formation flight for someone else
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.040]   and I was just in the back watching
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.700]   and there was an instructor in the flight.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.360]   And so what that means is,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.880]   instructor's in a single aircraft
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.680]   and then there's three or four other aircraft
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   and they're learning how to do joins
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.520]   and they're learning how to fly in formation.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.640]   And as a new student in the back, it's amazing, right?
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.740]   'Cause, you know, photo op time and all this,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.680]   like I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.520]   it's awesome.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.660]   And on the way back,
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.240]   we couldn't get our landing gear down, ironically.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.160]   So, you know, to make a long story short,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.000]   'cause it's overall not that exciting,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   we couldn't get the gear down,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.960]   we actually went to go do a control ejection
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.920]   to the target area where that is,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.840]   about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.540]   - Wait, did you just say that's not that exciting?
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.460]   - Well--
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.360]   - 'Cause that to me is pretty exciting.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.400]   First of all, I mean, that must be terrifying,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   like early on in your careers,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.080]   having seen those things.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   Yeah, like how often does that kind of thing happen?
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.480]   - Decent, more than you would think.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.320]   - More than you would think.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.080]   - So there was no significant panic,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.640]   this is like this understood,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.560]   this is what has to be done in this case?
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.440]   - I think I was probably just too dumb
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.880]   to realize the significance of it,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.400]   'cause as a new student, you know,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.040]   not really appreciating, you know,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.200]   just what is ahead of me if we are ejecting.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.060]   But at the time it was more, it was just like rote, right?
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:12.900]   'Cause I was back there
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.560]   and then I went from a observer mode
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.480]   to a I'm gonna provide you the help that I can provide you
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.600]   as a member of this crew, you know, mode.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.720]   And so it was less about, you know,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.480]   on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.840]   how vulnerable I am, you know,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   we're going through checklists,
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.480]   we're talking to people, we're getting ready.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.160]   So no, it wasn't fearful.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.760]   And the whole time we were doing one of these
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.080]   to try to get the gear down.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.320]   So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.080]   to try to get the gear out with the stick.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.980]   And it came down, it came down halfway there,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.360]   just on its own.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.320]   So it came back around and we did like a safety trap
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   in case there was a problem with the gear.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.960]   And that was my first flight, you know,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.040]   a little bit of serendipity,
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.800]   but I'm gonna fast forward a bit.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.320]   And I went back to the squadron as an instructor
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.280]   about five or six years later.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.760]   And I was an aviation safety officer at this point,
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.360]   which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.200]   And a student went in and he went in the back seat
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.000]   of a form flight, just like the one I went on.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.200]   And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.920]   Exact same type of flight.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.040]   They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.320]   And it caused the aircraft essentially
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.640]   just inverted itself almost 180 degrees
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.520]   at about 600 feet over the ground.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.720]   And they punched out just slightly outside
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.320]   the ejection window at about 300 or 400 feet or so,
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.160]   but they were completely fine.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.320]   So, you know, and then about two months later,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   we had another ejection.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.280]   About three months after that, we had another ejection.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.600]   So unfortunately, you know,
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.040]   it can be more common than people think.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.440]   - What does it feel like to get ejected?
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.720]   - Thankfully, I don't know.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.240]   I can describe it to you.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.000]   I can tell you what it's like from what I've heard,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.560]   but I truly think it's one of those things
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.480]   that you just don't understand until it happens.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.280]   It's like instantaneous about 250 Gs,
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.800]   which is only possible because of inertia and our blood.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.160]   Right, so you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.520]   for like a few milliseconds,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.200]   and then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.480]   to get you away from the vehicle itself.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   And so, you know, you may lose consciousness if you do,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.160]   you know, who knows where you wake up.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.040]   You know, you could be in a tree,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.160]   you could still be falling, you could be in the water, so.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.520]   - The physics of that is fascinating,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.840]   how they eject safely.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.920]   - Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.000]   I don't know the full story, but there was an airport.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   - I'm guessing nobody knows the full story.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.480]   It's probably a lot of shady stuff going on.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.400]   But you mean like in the early, early days, or?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.840]   - They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.200]   and just see how much their body could take it.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.520]   And he turned a lot of his body into mush
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.600]   in the process of getting that science done,
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.760]   but he saved a lot of lives.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.000]   - People used to be tougher back in the day.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.720]   That's how science used to be done.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.880]   So how did your training continue?
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.760]   So take me further through your career
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.360]   as you work towards graduating towards the F-18s.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.040]   - So in VT-9, where I was a student,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.560]   there's two phases, there's an intermediate and an advanced.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.200]   Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.800]   and at that point, you truly hear,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.360]   "All right, you're going jets now,
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.960]   "or you're gonna go one of the other aircraft
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.240]   "that land on the aircraft carrier."
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.000]   I was told I was going jets at that point.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.240]   And then we go into same squadron, same aircraft,
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.960]   same instructors, but it's called advanced now.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.320]   And now we're learning how to dogfight for the first time.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.360]   We're doing what we call tactical formation,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.960]   which is just like aggressive position keeping.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.320]   We are doing dogfighting in low levels
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.360]   and all sorts of great stuff.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.080]   So it's really that first introduction
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.320]   to that tactical environment
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.440]   and really putting Gs on the jet
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   and on your body and maneuvering.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.120]   - Is there a tactical formation,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.120]   is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.960]   - It is.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.440]   - So flying in, that's what you mean by formation?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.080]   So literally having an awareness?
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.240]   Is this done for you,
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   or are you as a human supposed to understand
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.200]   like where you are in the formation,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.520]   how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.360]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.040]   - Is it done autonomously or manually?
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.480]   - There's a great autonomy point
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.000]   on the end of this I've thought about.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.360]   But what we do, it's all manual.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.200]   So I'm looking at his wing
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.120]   and I'm looking at different visual checkpoints
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.680]   that form like a triangle,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.320]   like an equal out triangle essentially.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.660]   And then as that triangle is no longer equal,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.160]   I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.000]   - That's really cool.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.760]   - And so that's what I'm staring at
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.640]   for sometimes hours on end,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.480]   several feet away, doing one of these,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.600]   if I'm in the weather, that's all it is.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.840]   - So you get, it's almost like,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.320]   is it peripheral vision or is it your focal?
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.840]   - No, we're staring directly at it.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.880]   The peripheral is coming on my--
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.720]   - That's interesting.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.160]   - Stuff, right, my sensors and all my instruments.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.240]   And so he is my gyroscope at that point.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   - While you're flying, not looking straight.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.600]   - Correct, I'm flying like this for hours.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.700]   - It can hurt your neck.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.280]   We don't like doing this as much.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.980]   And I don't think it's just me, right?
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.800]   It's a weird thing where when you're like this,
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.460]   it's actually harder to fly formation slightly than here
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.700]   because being in line of your hand movement
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.620]   and of the aircraft somehow has an effect
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.980]   on our ability to be more precise and comfortable.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.820]   It's strange.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.380]   - But so there's a symmetry to the formation usually.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.440]   So one of the people on the other side
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.420]   really don't like being on that side.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.460]   - Does it, who gets the short straw?
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.180]   How do you decide which side of the formation you are?
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.020]   - The good question too,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.260]   because there's kind of rank in some sense.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.380]   So if it's a four person formation, right,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.580]   you have the division lead
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.340]   who's qualified to lead a whole division,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.180]   but maybe the other ones aren't.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.580]   And he has a dash two, and that's his wingman essentially.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.620]   And then in a division, there's two other aircraft.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.600]   And then you have another senior flight leader
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.300]   that's the dash three position.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.060]   And then you have dash four, the last one.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.860]   And if you are all lined up on one side,
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.900]   like fingertip, one, two, three, four,
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.860]   that dash four guy is gonna be at the end of that whip.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.500]   So if you're flying formation,
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.440]   each one's making movements relative to the lead,
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.220]   dash four is kind of at the end of that error.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.140]   And so his movements are kind of like a whip.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.340]   It's very difficult to fly in that position in close.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.100]   - Can you elaborate, is it 'cause of the air,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.940]   the air dynamics?
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.860]   So what's a whip?
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.980]   - If this is the flight lead and this is dash two,
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.820]   flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.780]   And flight two is gonna be working that triangle
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:33.980]   moving a little bit, right?
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.860]   And he has this small air bubble
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.380]   that he's doing his best to stay.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.260]   And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.860]   And so his air bubble is dash two plus his own.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.700]   And dash four-- - Okay, so it gets
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.740]   more and more stressful as you get farther out.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.860]   - Yeah.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.300]   - Okay.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.620]   What's the experience of that,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.180]   staring for long periods of time
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.820]   and trying to maintain formation?
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.300]   How stressful is that?
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.860]   Because like, you know, we're doing that when we drive,
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.700]   staying in lane.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.100]   And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it,
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.780]   it becomes somewhat, it's still stressful,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.740]   which actually is surprisingly stressful.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.140]   When you look at like lane keeping systems,
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.300]   they actually relieve that stress somehow.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.520]   And it's actually creates a much more pleasant experience
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.900]   while you're still able to maintain situational awareness
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.020]   and like stay awake, which is really interesting.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.340]   Like, I don't think people realize how stressful it is
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.060]   to lane keep when they drive.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.100]   So this is even more stressful.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.860]   So are you, do you think about that?
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.380]   Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.260]   from a psychology perspective?
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.420]   - It's very stressful.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.620]   So I taught students how to do this as well.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.100]   And so at our feet, we have two rudders.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.900]   And if I'm flying off of a flight lead over here,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.540]   what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying,
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.460]   like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying,
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.180]   I'll start to notice that he's having a harder
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.020]   and harder time keeping position.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.900]   What I'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.780]   They'll lock out the leg that's closest
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.820]   to the aircraft they're flying against
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.060]   and push on the rudder subconsciously
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.240]   'cause their whole body's trying to get away
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.740]   from the aircraft 'cause they're so uncomfortable
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.940]   being close to it.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.280]   And so I'll tell them, I can fix their form
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.180]   with just a couple words.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.940]   I'll say, wiggle your toes.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.540]   And they'll wiggle their toes and they'll realize,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.180]   and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.820]   'cause they realize they've been locked up
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.420]   and their formation flying will get a lot better.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.580]   And so, you know, there's a lot of stress
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.980]   associated with that.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   There's some interesting psychological
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   or visual issues such as vertigo as you're flying.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.820]   So if you're flying with him
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.740]   and then you fly right into a cloud, right?
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   That's when it's very stressful
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.060]   because you have to be very close
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.060]   in order to maintain visual.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.420]   And you might be on a thunderstorm, right?
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.620]   And so you have to be very tight.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.460]   You might start raining and then he's turning,
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.440]   but you might not even know that.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.340]   You might not even be able to see that turn.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.120]   And so all of a sudden you might look
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.100]   while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and level
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.780]   and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.060]   and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.940]   and your whole concept of where you are in the world
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.300]   starts getting very confused.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.360]   And you immediately get this sense of,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.700]   it's weird, like I look at the HUD
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.320]   and it feels, all my senses are telling me it's spinning,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.160]   but it's not, you know?
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.820]   And so I have to trust my instruments
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.060]   even though it feels like it's spinning.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.740]   And the same thing can happen
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.420]   when you're flying formation off of someone
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.040]   and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.960]   - But the point is to try to regain awareness
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.200]   by trusting the instruments,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.800]   like distrust all your human senses
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.000]   and just use the instruments
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.500]   to rebuild situational awareness.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.980]   - Not in this particular case
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.240]   because our situational awareness is predicated
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.280]   off of our flight lead.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.480]   So in a sense, I'm just trusting his movements.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.500]   And so he's my gyroscope, but you're absolutely right.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.720]   And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.120]   but I can't just stop flying form and trust my instruments
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.960]   because now I'm gonna hit him.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.400]   - Oh yeah, you have to pay attention to him.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.040]   - So he's my reference.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.640]   - So the instruments are not helping you significantly
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.080]   with his positioning.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.540]   - Not, it's all completely manual.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.120]   - So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.800]   - Yeah, and I've thought about automating
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.960]   that flight regime, but when I started thinking about it,
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.400]   I realized that all the formation keeping that we do
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.600]   is designed to enhance the aviators'
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.760]   ability to maintain sight, right?
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.320]   So we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.420]   and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.120]   We fly in one particular position
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.900]   so that all of the flight crew can look down the line
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.120]   and see the flight lead.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.000]   So everything has to do with the two air crew
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   visually maintaining sight of each other
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.020]   and defending each other, right?
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.640]   In a combat spread, I might be looking,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.040]   I may be three miles away from him flying formation,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.840]   directly beam and looking around
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.160]   and make sure nothing's there.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.360]   So as I'm looking into automating this process,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.160]   I thought, well, you know, sure it's easy
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.640]   to get a bunch of aircraft to fly in formation
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.560]   off each other, right?
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.160]   It's trivial, but why?
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   You know, what is the best formation?
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.640]   Why are they doing that?
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.120]   And that opened up a much more interesting regime
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.480]   of operations and flight mechanics.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.860]   mindset where we can bring in aircraft close
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.360]   to do some type of normal flying
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.100]   or reduce congestion around airports.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.520]   But when we consider formation in a tactical environment,
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.820]   we can be much more effective
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.840]   with non-traditional formation keeping
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.240]   or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.640]   - So autonomy used for formation keeping,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.080]   not for convenience, but for the introduction
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.960]   of randomness that's smart to--
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.000]   - Like to a real-time mission planner, yeah.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.240]   - And then that's where you also have
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   some human modification.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.240]   So it's like unmanned teaming enters that picture.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.380]   So you use some of the human intuition
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.820]   and adjustment of this formation.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.060]   The formation itself has some uncertainty.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.860]   I mean, it's such an interesting dance.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.860]   I think that is the most fascinating application
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.660]   of artificial intelligence is when it's human-AI
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.260]   collaboration, that semi-autonomous dance
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.340]   that you see in these semi-autonomous vehicle systems
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.900]   in terms of cars driving, but also in the safety
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.620]   critical situation of a airplane, of a fighter jet,
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.980]   especially when you're flying fast.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.460]   I mean, in a split second, you have to make
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.600]   all these kinds of decisions.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.760]   And it feels like an AI system can do
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.220]   as much harm as it can help.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.580]   And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.980]   - One of the challenges too, isn't just the algorithms
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.660]   of the autonomy itself, but how it senses the environment.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.300]   That of course is gonna be what all these decisions
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.140]   are based off of.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.060]   And that's a challenge in this type of environment.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.340]   - Well, I gotta ask, so F-18, what's it like
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.020]   to fly a fighter jet as best?
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.700]   I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.100]   What do you love about the experience of flying?
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.740]   - For me, and I think I'm an outlier a bit,
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.580]   it wasn't necessarily the flying itself, right?
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.220]   It wasn't necessarily the soaring over the clouds
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.220]   and looking down at the earth from upside down.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.900]   I came to love that, but it wasn't necessarily
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.940]   the passion that drove me there.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   I just had no exposure to that.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.060]   The only exposure I had was reading and going in the woods
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.620]   and science fiction and all that.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.900]   And so what seemed to kind of drive me towards that
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.140]   was just a desire to really be operating as close
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.720]   to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.300]   And that's the path that I chose
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.860]   to try to get close to that.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.940]   I thought that being in a fighter jet
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:48.300]   and all the tools and the technology
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.540]   and the knowledge and the challenges
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.460]   and the failures and victories that would come with that
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.060]   just seemed like something that I wanted to be a part of.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.660]   And it wasn't necessarily about the flying,
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.900]   but it was about the challenge.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.260]   And like I said, as a person from a small town,
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.140]   a small high school, being able to get my hands
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.140]   or even just near something of such technological
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.500]   significance was kind of empowering for me.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   And that's kind of what bore the love of flight from there.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.860]   Having some level of mastery in that aircraft,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.020]   it really feels like an extension of your body.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.460]   And once I got there, then the kind of love of flying
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.880]   kind of followed.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.140]   - So you sort of, one is the man mastery over the machine.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.540]   And second is the machine is like the greatest thing
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.180]   that humans have ever created, arguably.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.940]   The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.700]   I mean, the engineering in that.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:48.940]   However you feel about war,
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.420]   which is one of the sad things about human civilization
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   is war inspires the engineering of tools that are incredible.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:02.420]   And it's like, maybe without war,
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.680]   if we look at human history,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.660]   we would not build some of the incredible things we built.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.660]   So in order to win wars, to stop wars,
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.660]   we build these incredible systems that perhaps propagate war.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.420]   And that's another discussion I'll ask you about.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.080]   But this, to you, this is like,
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.460]   this is a chance to experience the greatest engineering
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.640]   humans have ever been able to do.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.140]   Like similar, I suppose, that astronauts feel like
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:31.980]   when they're flying.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.980]   - And I wanted to be an astronaut.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.580]   I wanted to take that route.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.120]   I was gonna apply to test pilot school.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.200]   It just didn't work out for me.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.400]   I ended up having a broken foot during my window,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.740]   but long story short,
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.700]   I ended up after my time in my fleet squadron,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.500]   and we can get back to the rest of the timeline if you want,
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   but I went to be an instructor pilot instead.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.760]   And then, I was talking about this
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.800]   with a squadron mate earlier today
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.940]   about how I certainly wouldn't be talking with Lex today
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.420]   if I ended up going to test pilot school.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.260]   - Why is that?
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.660]   - I never would have had the,
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:12.180]   I wouldn't, maybe recklessness, I don't know,
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.940]   but the willingness to have a conversation about UAP
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.900]   while I was, you know,
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.720]   that led me to the decision to get out once I went there.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.020]   And if I stayed in the Navy,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.580]   then I don't think that would have happened.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.300]   I wouldn't have been able to if I went that route.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.020]   - Well, as a small tangent,
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.180]   do you hope to travel to Mars one day?
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.480]   Do you think you'll step foot on Mars one day?
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.020]   - If you asked me that five years ago,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.580]   I would have said yes, I want to.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.420]   In fact, I would like to die on Mars.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.300]   - Not today.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.980]   - Now I have some hesitations,
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.140]   and I have some hesitations
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.820]   because I'm hopeful and optimistic.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.580]   And I think that, you know,
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.060]   I think that we are truly like on the brink
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.980]   of a very wide technological revolution
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.740]   that's going to kind of move us
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.260]   how we used to move information and data
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.220]   in this last century.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.300]   We're gonna be manipulating and managing matter
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.140]   in that next century.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.660]   And so I think that, I think our reach as humans
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.820]   are gonna get a lot wider,
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.860]   a lot faster than people may realize, or at least.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.660]   - Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.580]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.780]   - Well, I mean.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.260]   - Like Mars seems kind of boring.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.580]   I want to go beyond that.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.420]   - Do you mean the reach of humanity
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.820]   across all kinds of technologies,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.420]   or do you mean literally across space?
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.740]   - Across space, you know.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.460]   So we're gonna be, I think that as artificial intelligence
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.340]   and machine learning start broaching further
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.780]   into the topic of science, or the area of science,
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.780]   and we start working through new physics,
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.220]   we start working through,
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.300]   or I should say past the Einsteinian frameworks,
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.620]   as we kind of get a better idea
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.000]   of what space-time is or isn't.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.900]   We may have, we may find, you know,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.860]   answers that we didn't know that we were looking for,
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.540]   and we may have more opportunity.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.220]   And I'm not saying this is something
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.100]   I'm betting the farm on, of course,
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.620]   but maybe that's a road I want to explore on Earth
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.580]   instead of on Mars.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.380]   Maybe there's technology that can be brought to bear
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.520]   with new science and harder engineering
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.660]   that is a road that doesn't go past Mars
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.260]   to get outside the solar system.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.340]   - So there's different ways to explore the universe
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.660]   than the traditional rocket systems.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.660]   If we can continue sort of your journey,
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:33.740]   you said that you were attracted
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.580]   to the incredibly advanced technologies of the F-18s
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.640]   and just the fighter jets in general.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.760]   Let me ask another question,
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.180]   which seems incredibly difficult to do,
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.020]   which is landing on a carrier,
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.220]   or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.500]   So what's that like?
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.300]   What are the challenges of that?
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.860]   - Taking off is pretty easy.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.380]   It's procedurally somewhat complex,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.760]   where there's a lot of moving parts, almost like a clock.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.580]   You know, you're almost in a pocket watch,
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.860]   so it's sense and you're a part of the machinery.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.600]   And so long as you press the right buttons
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.440]   and do the right things,
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.020]   then you're gonna go shooting off the front.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.380]   - So there's like a checklist to follow,
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.380]   and there's several people involved in that checklist,
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.460]   and you just gotta follow the checklist correctly.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:17.620]   - Essentially, yep.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.700]   Lots of ways to screw it up,
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.900]   but you'll know how to screw it up.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.420]   But landing on the back of the boat
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.460]   is a whole different animal.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.820]   There's a lot more variables.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.340]   There's essentially one or two people responsible
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.620]   for the success of that.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.580]   The landing signal officer,
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.540]   who actually represents a team of specially trained aviators
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.660]   who are responsible for helping that aviator
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.680]   land on the boat,
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.260]   and the pilot himself.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.340]   to be good at it.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.620]   So to fly, quote unquote, the perfect pass,
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.820]   you essentially have to fly your head
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.060]   through a one foot by one foot box.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.040]   That's essentially the target you're shooting for.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.620]   Plus or minus probably about five knots on airspeed,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.620]   although we don't really judge it by airspeed.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.500]   It's something called angle of attack,
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   but generally, pretty tight parameters there.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.940]   And you can do everything perfect and still fail.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.340]   So when we go to touchdown,
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.860]   we immediately bring the power up,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   and we rotate as if we were bouncing off the deck.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.580]   And if we catch it, then we slow down,
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.180]   and then someone tells us to bring the power back,
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.460]   which we do, we don't do it on our own,
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.780]   'cause it's such a violent experience.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.780]   You can think you're trapped or not,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.260]   or something breaks and you bring your throttle back.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.740]   And that's a very serious thing.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.260]   It happened to the best of us.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.920]   I've done it once when I first got to the squadron.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.700]   It's called Ease Guns Land.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.700]   And so I came in the boat and I brought the power,
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.060]   I cracked the power back a little bit
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.660]   before I've been told to,
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.540]   or that my aircraft had finished settling in,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.860]   and that was a big faux pas, right?
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.940]   So especially as a new guy.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.500]   So it's a very serious business.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.460]   There's a lot of eyes on you,
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.100]   and there's a lot of ways to screw it up.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.380]   But the physical rush of having a great pass,
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.700]   and then there's just the crash into the boat,
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.140]   and all that, the physical sensation from it,
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.620]   when everything's going great,
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.620]   it's top of the world, it's a great feeling.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:13.580]   - How much of it is feel?
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.640]   How much of it is instruments?
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.620]   How much is other people just doing the work for you,
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.720]   catching you, as long as you do everything right?
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.860]   - There's a few systems we use.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.180]   One is called the BAL,
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.060]   and that BAL is External Tour Aircraft.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.940]   And it's-- - B-A-L-L, BAL?
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.780]   - Correct. - BAL, okay.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.480]   - It's a IFLOS landing system,
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.420]   which stands for something very long, convoluted.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.580]   But essentially it's a mirror with lights on it.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.540]   And you see the light at a different cell
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.580]   based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.260]   So if you're right on it, you're right in the middle,
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.100]   and if you're below, you're low.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.260]   And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft,
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.180]   that ball, I see that ball rise, I see that ball low.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.100]   It's a lagging indicator though, right?
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.180]   And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.400]   It takes time to spool up the engine.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.140]   So that adds to the complexity.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.640]   You have to think ahead a bit.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.020]   So you don't want to,
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.500]   you can't just bring the power up and leave it there.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.040]   You have to bring the power up, touch it, bring it back.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.360]   And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.940]   not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.980]   'Cause we have an angled deck.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.540]   And so you're constantly doing one of these
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.540]   to correct yourself as you go.
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.460]   - That's so stressful.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.380]   - And every time you do one of those,
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.500]   maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank, right?
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.300]   I'm losing lift, right?
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.060]   And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.900]   So I'm doing another one of those--
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:37.020]   - 'Cause you have to maintain the same level
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.420]   you're always lowering.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.320]   - It's a constant rate of descent that's increasing
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.180]   from about 200 feet per minute to about 650.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.820]   - And every time you do this, that's messing with that.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:46.660]   Okay.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.500]   - So you have to compensate.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.620]   - And you're doing that manually.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.460]   - Do it manually.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.280]   All right.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.940]   And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.300]   it becomes more and more narrow
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.300]   and you have to of course modulate your inputs
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.780]   such that they're smaller and smaller
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.940]   'cause they have a bigger and bigger effect
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.020]   as you get closer in.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.040]   And what happens too when you get in close
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.220]   is that right before you cross over,
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.180]   if this is the boat right here, your table,
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.060]   right before you kind of get your wings
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.120]   over the boat itself, this big wind
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.420]   from the main tower of the boat is where it dips down.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.500]   So the wind actually goes down and it's called a burble.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.780]   It'll actually pull the aircraft down
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.300]   and increase your rate of descent.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.340]   So at that particular point, you need to increase your power
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.620]   and try to compensate against that.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.920]   And so that's kind of a third variable
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.900]   that's trying to screw you up on your way down.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.060]   - What's the most difficult conditions
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.900]   in which you had to land or you've seen somebody
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:36.740]   had to land?
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.660]   Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:41.500]   - I was, yeah.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.060]   I was the headlanding signal officer for my squadron.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.900]   - So you've probably seen some tough landings.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.740]   - I have.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.900]   I've seen a ramp strike, which is when a part
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   of the aircraft hits before the landing area,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.460]   which is basically the round out of the boat
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.580]   that is before the landing area.
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.440]   So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.840]   It was just their hook, so it wasn't the aircraft
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.700]   and they were fine.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.220]   That one was kind of ugly.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.540]   - But it like rips that part of the aircraft.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.380]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.500]   - And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.660]   - In this particular case, it hit and then it gave
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.180]   and it essentially dragged the hook on the surface
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.100]   after that, and so he was able to grab a wire at that point.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.220]   - When does that kind of thing happen?
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.020]   Just a miscalculation by the pilot
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.060]   or is it weather conditions?
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.820]   - I wouldn't even call it a miscalculation.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.420]   I mean, I'm gonna put the blame on the pilot
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.660]   'cause he's the only one in the cockpit,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.360]   but at the end of the day, he's reacting
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.020]   to the situations he's dealing with.
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.740]   And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.540]   with the conditions that he's been given.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.940]   On that particular one, he just got too high
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:43.780]   of a rate of descent.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.620]   It's very common.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.620]   And that's what you see with new pilots.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.300]   It's the same thing too with older pilots, right?
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.300]   New ones and complacent ones.
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.460]   What you see is they'll try to make the ball go
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.940]   right where they want it in close.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.100]   They think they can beat the game a little bit.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.300]   And they try to, and so we have sayings,
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.460]   we teach pilots, as a landing signal officer,
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.000]   we tell them like, don't recenter the high ball in close.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.780]   It's one of the rules to live by.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.420]   And so when the ball's up high,
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.220]   don't try to bring it back in close
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.780]   to like the center point when you're in close
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.900]   'cause what you're gonna do is you bring the power off
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.420]   and you're gonna crash right down.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.660]   And that's what happens, right?
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.980]   'Cause you got the verbal pulling you down.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.120]   You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.460]   And then you have that type of maneuver.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.940]   - How are you supposed to do all of this
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.980]   in harsh weather conditions?
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.420]   - So that's the one I wanted to tell you about.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   That's the hardest one.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:33.340]   And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.820]   that's a really shitty day.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.580]   - 99 taxi lights on, what's that mean?
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.860]   - So everyone put your taxi lights on
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:43.100]   because you're about to land on the boat.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:43.980]   - And you don't see the boat?
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.660]   - The weather is so bad that the landing signal officer
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.720]   on the boat can't see you either.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.700]   And you can't see the boat
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.560]   and you won't be able to see it when you touch down.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.140]   So we call that a zero-zero landing.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.940]   And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.260]   who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:04.740]   from 1980 is talking directly to the pilot.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.020]   And he's looking at that little light in the rain
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.580]   and he's telling them you're high, you're low, power,
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.280]   things like that, come right, back to left.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.700]   And literally talking him down
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.020]   to land on the boat right there.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.020]   And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:18.860]   to the pilot to land
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.100]   because he's just listening to the voice,
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.820]   can't see the ball, can't see the boat.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.380]   - And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.820]   - You crash, I mean you crash.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.660]   We're going about 1600 feet per minute descent at that point.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.940]   - So you're going super fast.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.580]   So all of this is happening fast.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:37.580]   You don't know the moment it's gonna hit.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.060]   So you're just going into the darkness
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.860]   and just waiting for it to hit.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:42.700]   - Maybe not dark though.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.860]   A lot of times it's white.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.700]   - Into the light, you're going into the light.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.140]   And then there's a voice from an 80s phone.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.140]   I got it, this is terrible.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:58.940]   But so you still have to, so this kind of thing happens.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.340]   You still have to land.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.580]   - Sometimes you just don't have a place to divert.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.260]   But in a sense we're trained for that
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   because we do the night landings as well.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.940]   And I think you'll find this interesting
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.300]   but I always found that the night landings
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.660]   where in these particular cases,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.820]   you're usually lined up behind the boat,
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.060]   maybe 10, 15 miles, whereas the other ones,
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.980]   it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.580]   And so we can potentially see the boat way out there
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:25.180]   if the lights were on, which they're not.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.020]   But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.140]   in front of us.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.220]   But what's interesting is that it can take a while.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.420]   You might be 15 miles out
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:36.060]   and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.820]   You have a cloud deck maybe at six or 7,000 feet
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.980]   so that the starlight, there's no moon,
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.940]   but let's say the starlight's blocked out, right?
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.260]   'Cause just the starlight alone, no moon,
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.140]   you can see the boat, you can see the water.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.540]   But when that goes away, it's like closing your eyes.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.060]   You can't tell anything.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.620]   It could be upside down, it could be in any position.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.500]   And for me, it was almost a meditative process
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.580]   that I had to snap myself back out of
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.900]   when I was on like a long straightaway
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.100]   and then I would see the light pop up
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.660]   in the sea of darkness, right?
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.620]   No lights anywhere.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.140]   I can't even see the horizon.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.780]   And I just see a light out there.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.820]   My instruments were telling me,
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.420]   and they're turned down as far as they can go, right?
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:14.500]   So I can barely see them.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.140]   So my eyes can adjust.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.580]   And I'm just staring at this light in the distance.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.660]   And it's just very meditative and it's the hum behind you.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.300]   And then at like four miles,
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.820]   it's almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.340]   And you almost kind of have to snap back to it
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.180]   and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.260]   look around a little bit and engage my brain,
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.220]   link it back to my body and like do this thing.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.780]   - 'Cause you're gonna have to actually land.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.500]   Well, is there just, you said you don't necessarily feel
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.140]   the romantic notion of the whole thing,
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.780]   but is there some aspects of flying where you look up
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:50.500]   and maybe you see the stars or yeah,
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.420]   that kind of thing that you just like,
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.420]   holy crap, how did humans accomplish all of this?
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.320]   Like, am I actually flying right now?
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.460]   - I used to have those moments on the boat
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.060]   when I was catching planes land.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.100]   They would trap and it'd be nighttime
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.140]   and it's just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:07.980]   and nothing.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.340]   And I would have these moments where I'd be like,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.180]   how the hell did I end up here?
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.740]   You know, this one moment in time next to an aircraft
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.380]   landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know,
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.860]   where did my life, you know,
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.060]   how did my life go to end up here?
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.460]   How interesting.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.180]   But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.780]   and putting those on and looking up at the stars
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.740]   flying around, especially over the ocean.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.580]   - What do they look like?
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.980]   - There's just so many.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.900]   There's just so many stars that, you know,
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.580]   you normally can't see, they're shooting stars all the time.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.380]   Almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.100]   So it was a great pleasure to take advantage
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.500]   of the lack of light pollution in some cases,
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.460]   especially on deployment to go grab some goggles at night,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.980]   go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.900]   and just kind of look around, you know?
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.980]   - Yeah, it's humbling.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.180]   Quick break, bathroom break?
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.860]   - Yeah, what am I, a quick stretch of legs.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.980]   - You got a few cool patches.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.820]   - I do.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.940]   So this is a VFA-11 Red Ripper's patch,
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.280]   typically going actually on our arm.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.780]   So this is actually what we call the Boar's Head or Arnold.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.660]   So this is actually the Boar's Head
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.140]   from the Gordon's Gin bottle.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.140]   In 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere,
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.220]   and we apparently partied with the owner
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.220]   and founder of Gordon's Gin.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.060]   We had a great time and there's a signed letter
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.020]   in our ready room that says we can use the logo
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.180]   in perpetuity.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.020]   - Oh, nice.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.420]   - Yeah, so I'd like to give you that patch.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.540]   - I drank quite a bit of Gord, so this is good.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.780]   - And I'd like to give you that coin from our squadron.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.900]   - The Red Rippers, that's a badass name.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.580]   Thank you, brother.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.400]   - You're welcome.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.660]   - So let's jump around a little bit,
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.620]   but let me ask you about this one set of experiences
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.020]   that you had and people in your squadron had.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.740]   So you and a few people in the squadron
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.380]   either detected UFOs on your instruments
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.140]   or saw them directly.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.980]   Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.700]   and to the smallest technical details,
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.460]   'cause I love those.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.820]   - I'll do my best.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.120]   So we returned from, and when I say we,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.220]   I mean, not my squadron, but VFA-11, the Red Rippers.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.460]   I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.540]   I joined them on deployment in 2012,
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.380]   where they had been already out there
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.880]   for about six months or so,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.220]   operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.360]   I joined them and then we flew back
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.080]   and still as a relatively new guy,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.620]   we came back and we entered
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.020]   what's considered a maintenance phase
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.460]   where we slow down the tactical flying a bit,
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.340]   kind of recuperate, do some maintenance on the aircraft.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.860]   And our particular model of the F-18, the lot,
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.860]   the lot number was plumbed for the particular things
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.460]   that were needed to upgrade the radar
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.300]   from what's known as the ABG-73 to the ABG-79.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.960]   And the ABG-73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.740]   It's a perfectly fine radar,
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.060]   but the AESA radar is kind of a magnitude jumping capability,
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.140]   kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.100]   - Got it, so it's a leap to digital.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.740]   ABG-73, 79, are these things on a carrier?
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.980]   Like what are we talking about here?
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.540]   - This is our-- - How big is the radar?
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.940]   - Yeah, so this is actually the radar
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.740]   that's in the F-18 itself.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.980]   - Okay, so when you say that we're chosen,
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.980]   this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG-79.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.020]   - Less of a test and more of just,
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.420]   hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.060]   Like we're all going to these better radars.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.460]   They were building ones off the line with the new radar,
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.900]   but we were this weird transitionary squadron in the middle
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.060]   that transitioned from the older ones to the new ones.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.660]   But it's not particularly rare to fly
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.740]   with different types of radar,
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.260]   'cause in the, we call the fleet replacement squadron,
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.700]   essentially the training ground for the F-18,
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.140]   you have all sorts of F-18s with different radars.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.460]   So you are used to having multiple ones,
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.460]   but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.700]   And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.740]   on the radar that we were seeing the next day
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.740]   with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.460]   And these were sometimes, you know, the same day,
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.020]   you might go on two flights.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.060]   The one in the morning might be with the older radar,
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.580]   the one in the evening with the new radar.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.540]   And you'd see the objects with the new radar.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.380]   And that's not overly surprising in some sense.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.140]   They are more sensitive.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.260]   Perhaps they're not filtering out everything
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.100]   they should be yet,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.540]   or perhaps there's some other type of error.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.900]   Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.180]   It was relatively new,
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.340]   and we were somewhat used to there being software problems
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.780]   with these types of things occasionally,
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.340]   just like anything else.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.980]   And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.420]   We're getting some false tracks, as we call them.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.340]   - What were you seeing?
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.540]   - And so what we would see are representations of the object.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.700]   So this is off of our radar.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.140]   We're not seeing a visual image here.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.500]   This is kind of like what's being displayed to us
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.140]   almost like in a gaming fashion, right?
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.460]   Like the icon, right?
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.540]   So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there,
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.620]   and here's the parameters I can understand about it.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.540]   - So this is in the cockpit.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.660]   There's a display that's showing some visualization
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.940]   what the radar is detecting.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.220]   - Correct.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.700]   And there's two different ways to do that.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.620]   The first one is like the actual data,
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.620]   like the radar where it's showing me the data
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.820]   kind of as if it's in front of me,
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.740]   and I'm selecting those contacts.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.580]   And there's another screen
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.980]   called the situational awareness page,
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.940]   and that's kind of a God's eye view
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.580]   that brings all that data into one spot.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.860]   And so I'm gonna talk about this from the SA page,
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.060]   from the situational awareness page
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.300]   versus the individual radar ones 'cause it's easier.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.140]   But--
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.380]   - Can you, sorry to linger on that.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:01.060]   So the individual displays are like first person,
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.660]   and then the SA is, when you say God's eye view,
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.940]   it's like from the top,
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.020]   the integration of all that information
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.740]   as if it's looking down onto the earth.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.580]   - Yes.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.400]   - Is that a good way to summarize it?
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.200]   - It is, but for the aviator, it's slightly different
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.540]   because those two radar displays I talked about
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.220]   are at the bottom of that display
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.460]   is kind of representative of where I am.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.780]   And so I see what's in front of me.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.620]   - Got it.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.900]   - Whereas the situational awareness page,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.340]   the aircraft is located in the center of that.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.900]   And then all around me, you know,
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.220]   based off of the data link
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.600]   and wherever I'm getting information from,
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.800]   I can see that whole awareness page.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.860]   I can see all the situation.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.500]   So I'm gonna kind of talk about this
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.540]   from the situational awareness page,
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.940]   which is a top-down view,
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.980]   just to kind of frame our minds instead of jumping around.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:49.180]   And so what we would see out there
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.660]   is we'd see these indications that something would be there
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.540]   and they would have a track file.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.060]   That track file, that thing that represents the object,
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.260]   has a line coming out of it.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.420]   And that represents,
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   it's called the target aspect indicator.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.260]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.500]   So there's some tracking from the radar.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.380]   - Correct, so it's showing you where the object's going.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.340]   - This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.460]   So radar locks in on different objects
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.820]   and it tracks them over time.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.660]   - Correct.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.500]   - That's coming from the radar.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.940]   So it's like a built-in feature.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.780]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.620]   - Okay, cool.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.440]   - Out there we're seeing it.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.900]   We don't have to necessarily pull things
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.980]   into our tracker in some sense, right?
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.860]   Like it's all out there
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.820]   and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.540]   or to kind of focus in on it more so.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.020]   But the information should all be out there.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.460]   And so we'd see that target aspect indicator, that line.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.740]   On a typical aircraft, it would kind of look like this.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.020]   It would be coming out and it would go steady.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020]   And if they turn, it would be like,
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:39.860]   boop, boop, boop, boop,
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.820]   and you see them turn, right?
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.180]   Like it's not magic.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.340]   But this object, the target aspect would kind of
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.580]   be like all over the place.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.220]   Like kind of randomly in a 360 degrees,
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.940]   you know, from that top-down view,
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.780]   that line would be in any place.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.620]   So kind of, you know,
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.600]   is it unable to determine the target aspect?
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.820]   Is it stationary?
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.220]   You know, and that's just how it puts it out
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.260]   and it's not used to seeing it.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.460]   So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird,
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.500]   but it was different than what we were used to seeing
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.460]   'cause we weren't used to seeing
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.400]   stationary objects out there very much.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.700]   And what was also interesting is that
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.380]   these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.020]   These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet,
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.140]   500 feet, you know, with the wind blowing, you know?
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.780]   And so much like the sea, you know,
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.580]   when we're up there fighting, it affects everything.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.860]   We consider the wind when we're, you know,
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.460]   shooting missiles, when we're flying,
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.700]   or fuel considerations, it's like operating, you know,
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.220]   in that volume of air, like the ocean,
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.020]   everything's going with the current.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.140]   And so anything that doesn't go with the current,
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.900]   you know, is immediately kind of identifiable and strange.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.340]   And that's why these were initially strange
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.460]   is 'cause they would be stationary against the wind.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.340]   - So if you had something like a good drone
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.740]   in a windy conditions, what would that look like?
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.340]   Would it, it would it not come off as stationary?
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.260]   Would it sort of float about kind of thing?
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.140]   - No, I think with the drone technology we have today,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.460]   they could stay within a pretty tight location.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:00.420]   - Well, I meant like DJI drone, not like,
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.460]   I'm saying like generically speaking,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.860]   not a military drone.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.820]   - No, I have a DJI drone myself even,
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.940]   and you know, maybe not 100 knots,
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.060]   but if that thing's in 30 or 40 knot winds, you know,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.380]   the amount of distance it's going to be kind of
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.980]   doing one of these, like that change
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.660]   is not something I'm gonna detect from maybe many miles away.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.500]   - Interesting.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.580]   - So it could look very stationary.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.140]   But that wasn't necessarily,
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.060]   and what's interesting about this story
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.220]   is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.820]   You have to kind of look at everything.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.260]   And that's what I don't like about the Department of Defense
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.840]   and just generally people's take on this
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.700]   is that everything is kind of based around a single image,
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.540]   you know, or that one case,
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.580]   but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.600]   or the time it's been out there,
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.100]   how they're interacting relative to other objects out there.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.540]   And you don't get that information
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.380]   when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.800]   Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.380]   - So you yourself, from your particular slice
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.580]   of things you've experienced and seen directly
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.380]   or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.980]   about what are the things that were being seen.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.900]   - I wouldn't go that far.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.040]   I've just been able to, you know,
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.440]   eliminate some variables
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.500]   because of how long I've observed it.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.720]   So like you said, yes, can a drone stay
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.340]   in a particular position against the wind like that?
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.620]   Certainly, but I don't think it can do that
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.520]   and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   And so when you look at it outside of that moment in time,
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.960]   then it eliminates a lot of the potential things
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.720]   it could be, at least from my perspective.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.560]   - So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.560]   - We'd see them flying in patterns,
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.560]   kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns,
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.460]   or just going kind of straight east.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:46.120]   I occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.040]   but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach,
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.820]   just for extremely extended periods of time,
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.440]   you know, essentially all the time.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.140]   And this is airspace where there's not supposed
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.480]   to be anything else at all.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.760]   And it's pretty far out there.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.460]   It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.860]   - Can you say the location that we're talking about?
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.660]   - Off the coast of Virginia Beach.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.500]   - Got it.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.300]   And so nobody's supposed to be out there.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.520]   - It's possible for people to be there.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.940]   It's not necessarily restricted, but it's well monitored
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.460]   and we're out there every day, all day.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.280]   And so, you know, people know to stay clear.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.620]   If a Cessna goes bumbling in there,
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.820]   everyone's gonna know about it.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.140]   FAA is gonna, you know, call them out.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.180]   It's gonna tell us about it.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:27.040]   So, incursions happen, not a big deal,
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.060]   but they're pretty rare, honestly,
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:29.980]   'cause everyone knows the area
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.100]   and we've been operating there for decades.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.940]   - And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.660]   that these objects were taking?
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.120]   - Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.720]   or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds,
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.380]   or I just see them kind of,
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.100]   and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.220]   And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.540]   is gonna be just very precise, right?
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.500]   It's gonna be locked on straight.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.740]   Whereas I could see an airplane,
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.220]   I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right?
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.940]   'Cause it's not gonna be perfect.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.300]   Computer's not controlling it.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.720]   And these seemed more like that.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.300]   Not that they were imprecise,
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.800]   but that they were even much more erratic than that.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.020]   So, like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   It was just kind of like a, you know,
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.500]   weird drift like that in that direction, you know?
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.980]   - So, it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer,
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.060]   not disrespected computers.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.980]   So, it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.660]   - That's not the sense that I got.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.860]   - So, how many people have seen them in the squadron?
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.780]   Sort of how many times were they seen?
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.420]   How many, were there times when there's multiple objects?
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.340]   - Once we started seeing them on the radar enough,
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.220]   and we would get close enough,
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.860]   we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.100]   So, our advanced targeting pod.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.320]   It's essentially a infrared camera
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.500]   that we use for targeting,
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.040]   mostly in the air to surface environment.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.900]   We don't use it in the air to air arena.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:56.140]   It's just not that good of a tool, frankly.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:00.460]   But we would see IR energy emitting from that location
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.780]   where the radar was dropping us off.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.940]   So, you know, the radar, we'd lock onto the object
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.540]   and our sensors would all look there.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.980]   And so, then we could see that it's looking
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.060]   at the right piece of sky,
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.100]   but there's energy actually coming from there.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.460]   So, now we started thinking that, okay,
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.700]   maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more,
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.660]   maybe something is physically here, of course.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.100]   And then people started to try to fly by and see it.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.740]   And at this point, you know,
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.980]   I would say maybe 80 to 90% of our squadron
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.740]   had probably seen one of these on the radar at this point.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.300]   Everyone was aware of it.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.180]   There was small communication, I think,
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.580]   between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.120]   So, I knew it wasn't just our squadron
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.100]   for whatever strange reason,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.740]   'cause other squadron would be out there
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:37.780]   and we would talk to them, be like,
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.540]   "Hey, like, careful, there's an object.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.380]   Are you aware of that?"
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.740]   You know, so like, they would be aware of it.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.420]   And then, of course, people would wanna go see
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.320]   what they look like, right?
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.740]   So, people would try to fly by.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.220]   I try to fly by 'em.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.220]   - I like how that's an of course.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.220]   - Of course.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.260]   - Of course you'd wanna fly by it.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   - Fair enough.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.900]   - There's an argument against that kind of perspective
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.620]   that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don't,
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.260]   but perhaps that's part of the reason you wanna fly by it,
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.780]   is to understand better what it is, if it's a threat.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.740]   - We have a lot of context now that we didn't back then.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.340]   You know, and so, it was still a,
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.340]   "Hey, is this a balloon?
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.180]   Is this a drone?"
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.380]   You know, at a certain point.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.580]   And we're also aware of, you know,
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.300]   potential intelligence gathering operations
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.980]   that could be going on.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.100]   We're up there flying our tactics, we're emitting,
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.940]   we're practicing our EW, you know,
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.380]   we're turning at particular times.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.620]   Like, there's stuff that can be learned.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.460]   It's not a secret.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.940]   And, you know, countries keep different fishing vessels
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.220]   and whatnot in international waters off there,
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.700]   so it's not exactly a secret
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.340]   that we're being observed out there.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:39.000]   So to think that a foreign nation would want to,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.140]   you know, somehow intercept information,
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.720]   whether that's our radar signals or our jamming capabilities
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.900]   to try to break that down or understand it better
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.740]   or be ready for that next fight.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.700]   I mean, that's what scares me about this scenario
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.980]   because we didn't jump right to aliens or UFOs.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.500]   We thought, you know, this is a radar malfunction
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.320]   we need to be aware of.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.160]   It's a safety issue.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.940]   And then, you know, this could be a tactical problem
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.940]   right here because everything we do is based off of crypto
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.980]   and, you know, locations.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.580]   Everything's classified we do out there, right?
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.540]   And so over time, if you gather enough data
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.860]   about those fights and just monitor them forever,
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:22.260]   just like some nations do with other piece of technology
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:25.500]   or software, they could probably learn a lot.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.100]   And so we have to be cognizant of that fact
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.180]   and defend against it.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:32.620]   - So what can you say about the other characteristics
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.380]   of these objects like shape, size,
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:43.340]   texture, luminosity, how else do you describe object?
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.180]   Is there something that could be said?
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.900]   So you said, like, this is a tech town radar, step one.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.980]   Now you have FLIR images that can give you a sense
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.940]   that that's actually a physical object.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.700]   What else can be said about those physical objects?
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.380]   - So eventually someone did see one with their own eyeballs,
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.620]   multiple people.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:04.700]   And they saw it in a somewhat interesting way.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:08.740]   The object presented itself at the exact altitude
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.380]   and geographic location of the entry points
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.200]   into our working areas.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   So we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.100]   and people leave the areas at the same point
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.620]   at a lower altitude.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.500]   Probably one of the busiest pieces of sky
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.980]   on the Eastern seaboard.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.580]   So two jets from my squadron went out and they went flying
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.100]   and they entered the area where these objects
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.540]   went right between the aircraft.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.220]   - So they're flying in formation
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.300]   and the object went between the aircraft.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.660]   - They went between the object, I think.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.700]   I don't think that the object was moving.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.300]   I don't think it aggressively went at them.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.420]   I think it was located still there
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.920]   and then they flew through it.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   But they didn't have it on their radar.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.080]   And I think the radar might've been malfunctioning.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.000]   I don't know that for sure.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.320]   I would like to look into it.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.560]   But my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.640]   it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid the object
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.480]   that was there 'cause they knew these were physical
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.320]   at that point.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.080]   And we would go up to these objects all the time
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.800]   and try to see them and couldn't see them.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.360]   And we didn't know what it was.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.680]   Was it that were they just not there or being fooled?
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.640]   Was something happening?
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.180]   Were they moving, dropping out to the last minute?
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.640]   We're going by pretty quick so it's difficult to tell.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.020]   But perhaps if his radar wasn't working
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.540]   he wasn't receiving energy from the jet
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.700]   and the jet of course didn't know that it was there.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.220]   And so whatever the case was, they flew right by
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:28.340]   and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.820]   inside a clear translucent sphere.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.460]   And the kind of the apex of the cube
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   were touching the inside of that sphere.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.560]   - That's an image that's haunting.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.080]   So what did they think it is?
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.700]   What did they think at that moment?
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:47.080]   That they, is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.240]   that they're just describing a geometric object?
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.120]   It's not on radar so it's unclear what it is.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:18:00.020]   Yeah, what was the main kind of other description
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.640]   they've had of it in terms of the intuition
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.920]   from a pilot's perspective?
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.680]   You know, you have to kind of identify what a thing is.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.480]   - To answer the first part,
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.400]   they actually canceled the flight and came back
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.000]   'cause they were, you know,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.200]   it's like if there's one of these out here
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.760]   and we're almost hitting them and it's right there,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   then perhaps we need to get a different jet
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.960]   with better radar.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.440]   So they came back and they're in their gear
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.560]   and they're talking to the front desk
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.640]   and talking to Skipper and like,
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.760]   hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.560]   And this kind of was one of those
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.200]   kind of slight watershed moments
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.600]   where we all were kind of like, all right,
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.520]   this is a serious deal now.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.120]   Maybe we thought they were balloons or drones
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.960]   or malfunctions, or maybe we thought it was spying,
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.840]   but at the end of the day,
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.960]   if we're gonna hit one of these things,
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.480]   then we need to, you know,
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.440]   we need to take care of the situation.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.120]   And that's actually when we started submitting
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.760]   hazard reports or haz reps to the Naval Aviation Safety
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.640]   kind of communication network.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.560]   And it's, you know, it's not like a big proactive thing
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.680]   where people are gonna investigate.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.300]   It's more of a data collection mechanism
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.480]   so that you can kind of share the aggregate data
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.860]   and make sure that things are progressing.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.000]   So it wasn't a mechanism that would result
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.460]   in action being taken,
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.420]   but we were hoping to at least get the message out
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.840]   to whomever was maybe running a classified program
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.560]   that we were not aware of or something like that,
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.340]   that, hey, like, you could kill somebody here.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.160]   Like, you've grown too big for your britches here.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.720]   Take a step back.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.760]   So that was our concern at that point.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.080]   That's kind of where we were thinking this was going.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.380]   - What's the protocol for shooting at a thing?
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.380]   Was there a concern that it's a direct threat,
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.480]   not just surveillance,
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.320]   but a thing that could be, yeah, a threat?
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.360]   - At least from my perspective,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.480]   like that never really crossed into my mind.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.000]   I thought it was potentially an intelligence failure
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.600]   that could be being watched and information gathered.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.400]   But I didn't think that it was something
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.040]   that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.320]   It wouldn't really make sense either to,
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.240]   it would be shocking to like have one of these objects
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.080]   take out an F-18,
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.400]   but there's no real tactical advantage
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.680]   other than fear perhaps.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.760]   - Psychological.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.000]   - Yeah.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.080]   - I've learned a lot about the psychological warfare
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.600]   in Ukraine as a big part of the war
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.960]   in terms of when you talk about siege warfare,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   about wars that last for many years, for many months,
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.560]   and then perhaps could extend to years.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.760]   But yes, it didn't seem,
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.680]   - Correct.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.520]   (sighs)
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.840]   - So looking back now from all the pieces of data
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.200]   you've integrated, you've personally added,
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.920]   what do you think it could be?
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.960]   - I don't know.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.120]   I don't know what it could be.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.080]   I think we've been able to categorize it successfully
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.600]   into a few buckets.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.880]   We've been able to say that this could be US technology
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.920]   that someone put in the wrong piece of sky
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.040]   or perhaps was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.920]   by someone that wasn't being best practices.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.520]   - Is there, sorry to interrupt,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.400]   is there a sort of modularity to the way
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.920]   the military operates to where it's possible
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.960]   for one branch not to know about the tests of another?
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.680]   - Yeah, I think it's perfectly reasonable
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.720]   to think that that could occur, right?
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.840]   And so if we just make that assumption,
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.960]   we can integrate that into our analysis here
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.680]   and just say, okay, but at the point we're at now,
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.480]   we have to assume that that's not the case, right?
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.840]   With everything that's been going on
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.280]   and the statements have been made and the hearings,
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   I think that if it was a non-communication issue,
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   we're in big trouble at this point.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.480]   - What about it being an object from another nation,
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.680]   from China, from Russia?
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.280]   - Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right?
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.040]   Maybe that's, you know, I don't think it's controversial
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.320]   to say that our allies could be gathering information
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.480]   about us or anything of that nature,
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.980]   but that would be an extreme case,
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.720]   but I think it's just important to say, right,
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.400]   to not just say Russia or China
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.680]   and just call them the bad guys
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.600]   and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.720]   And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.020]   anyone else, and it doesn't necessarily need
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.040]   to be a foreign power.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.380]   It could be a non-government entity, perhaps,
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.880]   although I think that's very unlikely.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.360]   But again, these are things you must consider
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.280]   if you kind of throw everything other
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.640]   in the US under scrutiny.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.440]   But, you know, from what has been reported
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.960]   and the behaviors that have been seen,
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.760]   it would be, I would expect to see remnants
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.960]   of that technology elsewhere in the economy.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.320]   There seems to be too many things
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.680]   that require advanced technology
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.900]   that would be beneficial commercially,
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.160]   as well as in other military applications,
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.240]   for it to be completely locked away
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.200]   by one of our competitors.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.340]   Now, I could see us perhaps locking something away
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.560]   if we're already in the lead
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.620]   and having it to pull out as needed,
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.560]   but for someone that's perhaps in a power struggle
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.120]   and they're in second place,
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.400]   they might be more aggressive with the development
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.800]   of different types of technology
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.680]   willing to accept bigger risks.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.440]   - Do you think it could be natural phenomena
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.200]   that we don't yet understand?
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.460]   - I think that there are a number of things
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.760]   that this is going to be, right?
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.400]   I don't think there's one thing at the end of the day,
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.400]   but I certainly think that that is part
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.620]   of what some of this could be.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.640]   I don't think it's what we were seeing on the East Coast,
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.400]   and I don't think it is related to the Roosevelt incident,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.960]   or I'll even go out and say the Nimitz incident, but--
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.520]   - What's the Roosevelt incident?
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.040]   - The Roosevelt incident, typically referred to as the Gimbel
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.520]   and/or the Go Fast video.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.140]   - And then the Nimitz is from,
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:34.600]   what David Fravor has witnessed directly
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.760]   and has spoken about.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.160]   We'll talk about that as well.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:42.020]   I'd just love to get your sort of interpretation
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.560]   of those incidents, but yeah, so in this particular case,
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.720]   natural phenomena could be a part of the picture,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.920]   but you're saying not the whole picture.
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.340]   - Yes, yes, and we can't discount it.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.440]   Oh, the other thing is, what about the failure
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.440]   of pilot eyesight, like sort of some deep mixture
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:08.800]   of actual direct vision, human vision system failure,
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.800]   and like psychology, like seeing something weird
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.760]   and then filling in the gaps,
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.840]   because in order to make sense of the weird.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.840]   I've tried to expose myself to scenarios like that
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.040]   that I don't necessarily think are right,
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.320]   but I've explored them to see if they could have some truth.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.040]   And one example is, let's imagine a scenario
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.480]   where if we're seeing these objects every day
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.720]   off the East Coast, I can imagine a technology
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.400]   or an operation where you had some type
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.540]   of traditional propulsion system operating drones
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.640]   in order to gather data like we had discussed,
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.600]   and I could envision a clever enough adversary
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.440]   and replace them with new objects,
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.040]   essentially when we're not looking, right?
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:02.440]   And that accounts for the large airborne time.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.880]   And so I explore options like that,
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.240]   and I try to see what evidence and assumptions
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.420]   need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.640]   And you would need so much infrastructure.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.360]   You'd need so many assets.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.720]   And so I try to explore some of those fallacies
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.040]   and some of those concerns.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:24.280]   And as aviators, we're trained into many actual physical,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.800]   like eyesight and kind of illusion training.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.520]   So like at nighttime flying,
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.680]   there's so many things that can happen
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.940]   flying with false horizons.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.900]   And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff,
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.320]   but this just falls outside the category
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.400]   from my perspective.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.600]   - What was the visibility conditions
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.840]   in the times when people were able to see it?
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.040]   We just earlier discussed complete nighttime darkness.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.040]   In this case, was it during the day?
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:56.040]   - It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident, yep.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.040]   - In a world that's full of mystery,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.720]   I have to ask what do you think is the possibility
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.520]   that it's not of this earth origin?
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.280]   - I like the term non-human intelligence in a sense.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.080]   Because again, there's a lot of assumptions in there
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.960]   that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.600]   These could be something that are weather phenomena,
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.440]   of earth, right?
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.280]   Or something else that is just something
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.880]   we don't understand and can't imagine right now
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.240]   that's still of this earth.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.200]   If we consider extraterrestrials or something
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.760]   that came from a physical place far away in space time,
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.860]   that leads us to some detection assumptions
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:41.000]   that we would need to make.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.800]   And so I just try to not categorize it under anything
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.040]   and just say, "Hey, is this demonstrating intelligence?"
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.160]   And start from there as a single object.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.800]   What can we learn about it kinematically?
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.640]   How it's performing?
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.560]   What does that mean for its energy source?
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.040]   What does that mean for the G-forces inside?
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.640]   And then step it out a level and say,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.120]   "Okay, how are these interacting with our fighters
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:00.960]   "if they are?
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.080]   "How are they interacting with the weather
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.280]   "and their environment?
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.920]   "How are they interacting with each other?"
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.000]   So can we look at these and how they're acting
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.600]   perhaps as a swarm?
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.880]   Especially off the East Coast
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.280]   where this is happening all the time
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.120]   with multiple objects.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.120]   And so we might be able to determine some things
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.560]   about their maybe sensor capabilities
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.000]   or the areas of focus.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.240]   If we can determine how they're working
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.800]   in conjunction with each other.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.200]   But seeing one little flash of an object
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.040]   doesn't provide that type of insight.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.200]   But we have the systems for it.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.480]   But it's kind of, maybe not an irony,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.840]   but it's a fact of life, the reality that many
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.440]   of these well-deployed, highly capable systems
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.120]   are held under the military umbrella,
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.440]   which makes it difficult to provide that data
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.480]   for scientific analysis.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.120]   - So there's probably a lot more data on these objects
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.600]   that's not being, that's not made available,
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.920]   probably even within the military for analysis.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.960]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.800]   I think there's a lot of data that could be made available.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.640]   And that's one of the reasons why I've been engaged
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.720]   with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.520]   to build a large resources of cross-domain expertise
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.120]   so that if or when that data is available
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.800]   or that there's additional analysis needed,
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.640]   we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.680]   - So there was a recently a house intelligence
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.120]   subcommittee hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.600]   What was the goal of that hearing?
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.840]   And can you maybe summarize what you heard?
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.360]   - The hearings, from my perspective,
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.280]   seemed a bit disingenuous.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.560]   It was kind of top level.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.680]   I think-
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.400]   - Who was it run by, sorry to interrupt,
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   like who were the people involved
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.160]   and what was the goal, the stated goal?
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.080]   - Congressman Andre Carson did chair the committee
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.160]   and he was, I think, ultimately responsible
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.760]   for bringing it all together.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.440]   You know, I think the intent from Congress
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.520]   was to try to bring light to what has been happening
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.000]   with the Navy and to help show the American people
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.800]   that Congress is taking this serious
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.760]   because something serious is happening.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.640]   But, you know, the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.880]   They talked around it a lot.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.880]   They, you know, advertised their love of science fiction,
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.640]   but they, you know, they didn't treat this,
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.320]   I would say, in the manner it deserved
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.600]   as a potential tactical threat
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.240]   if it's coming from a foreign power.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.560]   And I get it though, at the same day,
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.840]   they have very specific objectives within the DOD, right?
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.320]   They have a very important job.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.840]   Their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory science
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.680]   for no reason.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.360]   So I applaud and I encourage their efforts
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.280]   on the intelligence side to help understand this.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.400]   But my concern is that they play a role
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:44.400]   they're not well suited for, which is doing science.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.160]   - And the Pentagon has opened a new office
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.600]   to investigate UFOs called
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.720]   All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.380]   What do you think about this office?
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:55.000]   Do you think it can help alleviate
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.840]   in the way which this hearing perhaps has failed
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.920]   to improve more the scientific rigor
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.180]   and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.680]   - I think that remains to be seen.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.400]   I think it's a step in the right direction,
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.880]   but it's a step that was taken
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.060]   because the previous step didn't happen, right?
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.720]   So the AOI-MSG was the progeny, essentially,
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.480]   of the AARO or ARO.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.440]   And, you know, the name was changed
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.900]   because nothing was happening
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:29.080]   and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.520]   that were created to make this topic unpalatable.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   The Airborne Object Identification
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.720]   and Synchronization Management Group.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.280]   Quite the mouthful.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.960]   I practice that.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.680]   But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office,
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.360]   you know, from my perspective at least,
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.240]   at least the perspective that they're putting out,
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   they seem to want to be open.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.960]   They put out a Twitter handle.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.360]   They're going out on Twitter and communicating,
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.600]   saying they want to keep this open.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.600]   But, you know, that's gonna run into a classification wall.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.320]   - Well, so Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.240]   seems like an interesting guy.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.760]   - He does, yes.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.360]   - So he's got a,
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.960]   I haven't looked into deeply,
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.300]   but he seems to have sort of,
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.600]   he's coming from like a science research perspective,
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.780]   like a background.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:20.160]   So he might be, at least in the right mindset,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.000]   the right background to kind of lead
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.840]   a serious investigation.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.680]   - I think so.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.360]   I'll just say generally, you know,
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.080]   the office has been receptive to AIAA reaching out
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.040]   in order to collaborate, which has been a positive sign.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.560]   Also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spergel
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.040]   and NASA's effort as well.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.760]   I see these organizations that are standing up,
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.800]   I do see them as good faith efforts
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.920]   that are coming about through a lot of difficulty.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.960]   And negotiation most likely, right?
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.360]   And I see these as a small door opening
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.640]   that if we could take advantage of,
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.780]   can lead to a much more productive relationship
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:03.480]   between these organizations.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.960]   - How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.280]   Does it come from the civilian leadership?
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.760]   Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents?
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.460]   Does it come from the public?
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.300]   Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:19.960]   Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy going to protect it
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.920]   against any public pressure?
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.840]   What do you think?
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.840]   - I think we've been in that latter state for a while,
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.000]   but you know, society seems to be a bit different nowadays.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.360]   You know, we have the ability to communicate and to group
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.560]   and to form relationships in a way
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.480]   that hadn't been able to be present in the past.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.160]   We've been able to do research, for better or worse,
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.560]   on our own, you know, in a way that hasn't been able
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.880]   to happen before.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.160]   And so I sense that people are a bit less willing
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.240]   to kind of buy the bottom line statement
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:52.200]   from those in power as they used to be,
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.760]   back when they didn't have access to those tools.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.600]   And so I do think there is a massive role
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.520]   for the general society, general populace to play
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.020]   to show that they are interested in this.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:05.160]   Because it's not that I don't think the politicians
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.880]   or the leaders in the Pentagon,
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.420]   it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.120]   or think it's toxic per se,
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.960]   but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.760]   and they don't feel comfortable talking about it.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.060]   And these are people that have spent their entire careers,
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.320]   you know, working towards a goal
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.640]   and getting to very high positions within government.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.480]   And so this is very against their nature
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.760]   to take a stance on a topic like this.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.640]   And so the fact that these are standing up,
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.520]   even if they do have a small budget
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.340]   or if they struggled a bit at first,
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.640]   I still think it's a massive change, you know,
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.760]   and it's a big step away from that stigma
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.640]   that has been pervading this topic for so long.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.720]   - And you're actually part of alleviating the stigma
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:49.700]   for somebody that's as credible, as intelligent,
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.580]   as like varied in background,
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.140]   able to speak about these things.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.200]   That's a big risk that you took,
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.980]   but it's extremely valuable
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.820]   'cause it's alleviating the stigma.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:00.740]   - I thank you for saying that,
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.900]   but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.940]   You know, I didn't come out about aliens, right?
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:06.780]   Or whatever.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.620]   I had a safety problem
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.080]   that I started asking questions about.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.220]   And, you know, I went down a road
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.620]   as a Navy trained aviation safety officer, right?
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:17.640]   That sent me to school for six weeks in Pensacola
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.620]   to be a safety officer, you know.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.780]   We're almost hitting these objects
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.900]   and it's not something that happened in the past
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:24.940]   and we want to understand it.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.860]   It's happening right now.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.300]   Like these occurrences are still happening.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.940]   Aviators are flying right now,
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.220]   are still flying by these things.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:34.740]   And in fact, I mentioned I was a instructor pilot.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:40.220]   I had a student call me about eight months ago or so.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:41.620]   And he's like, "Hey, sir, you know,
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.500]   I made it to the fleet finally."
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.940]   You know, I had trained him how to fly
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.380]   and then he goes to F-18,
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.900]   he goes another year of training
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:50.140]   and then he gets out to his squadron on the East Coast
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.700]   and he's flying with a senior member of the base,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:58.460]   NAS Oceania, where the fighters fly out of Senior 05, 06.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.300]   And it was kind of a bad weather day.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.460]   And so they said, "Hey, you know,
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.380]   if the weather's not good enough
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.240]   for us to do this dog fighting set,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.700]   we'll go out and do a UAP hunt, you know,
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.780]   and see if we can't find any things
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:09.020]   or take a look at them, you know."
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:11.460]   I don't know if it was in jest or not, but, you know,
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:14.260]   this, they, I actually would say it's not in jest
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.780]   because there were notices that were being briefed
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.860]   about this being a safety hazard at this point.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.620]   And so I, now that I think about it,
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.060]   it likely wasn't in jest.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.540]   Long story short, they went flying,
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.820]   the weather was too bad,
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.340]   they did go on a UFO hunt and they physically saw one,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.020]   you know, and he called me up and said,
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.500]   "Hey, sir, I saw a Cuban spear,
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.380]   they're still out here, you know, years later."
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.420]   And so it's almost like a generational issue,
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.660]   you know, for these fighter pilots,
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:37.960]   at least on East Coast.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.820]   - But that's great that they can talk about it, right?
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.060]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.140]   They feel at least comfortable,
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.860]   they have a reporting mechanism.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.060]   And so that was one of the problems that I noticed,
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.660]   that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:52.900]   to take care of safety issues and even tactical issues
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:53.740]   when the time's right,
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:55.820]   in order to keep track of what's going on.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.360]   But there's no way to communicate about this.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.840]   Sure, we could submit a hazard report,
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.260]   but nothing's actually being investigated.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:07.180]   And if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more,
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.020]   it deserves attention.
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.460]   - If I could ask your sort of,
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.260]   take your opinion of the different UFO sightings
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.660]   that the DoD has released videos on.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.620]   So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:26.000]   that David Fravor and others have cited?
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.800]   - That's a truly anomalous experience.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:35.360]   I can't do like mental models in my head
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.580]   to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.780]   Like as much as I try, right?
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.600]   Just as a logical process, as a practice,
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.180]   I can't pick it apart in the way
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.460]   that we were just talking about a moment ago
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:49.260]   about thousands of drones being like sent up
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.340]   in very tricky manners, right?
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:53.540]   I can't really bring myself to a clever solution
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.300]   that other than just saying the pilots are lying
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.140]   or it was error.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.980]   And I believe, I know Dave Fravor,
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.220]   I consider him a friend, we talk a lot.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:07.000]   I have zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.620]   - Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:14.140]   But in terms of the actual UFO,
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.460]   is there something anomalous and interesting to you
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.960]   about that particular case?
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.840]   Maybe one interesting aspect there is
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.360]   how much do I understand about the water surface
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.560]   and underwater aspects of these UFOs?
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.140]   It seems like a lot of the discussion is about the movement
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.960]   of this particular thing that seems to be weird,
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.380]   anomalous, seems to defy physics.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.120]   But what about stuff that's happening underwater?
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.800]   That's interesting to me.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.440]   If I had advanced technology,
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.440]   I would certainly like to operate in part underwater
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.660]   'cause you can hide a lot of stuff there.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:53.600]   - You think it would be somewhat as easy
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.040]   as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.880]   - Yeah.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.080]   - You know, I wish I had a great answer for that,
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.880]   but as an aviator, that's a kind of a black box for us.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.760]   We don't have great,
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.160]   what I would call cross-domain tracking, right?
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.840]   I can't see something go underwater
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.380]   and then follow it underwater.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.840]   - So it's literally not your domain.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.440]   Like underwater, leave that for somebody else.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.500]   - Yeah, and I use that terminology
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:20.000]   'cause it's kind of important, right?
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.120]   Cross-domain tracking is something
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.720]   that we haven't had to necessarily worry about, right?
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.840]   'Cause airplanes operated in the air
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:28.400]   and submarines operated underwater
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.320]   and space planes operate in space, right?
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.240]   But there's gonna be, that's gonna blur, I think,
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.040]   as we move along here, especially in the air and space regime
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.840]   and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.720]   at 40,000 feet to another radar system
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.680]   that can track it up to 200,000 feet,
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.800]   you know, that might be a value.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.320]   And so we seem to be missing that right now.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.720]   - So what about the Go Fast and the gimbal videos
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.240]   that you mentioned earlier?
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.920]   Like what's interesting there to you?
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.120]   - So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.820]   I was airborne for that one.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:06.000]   The person that recorded it is a good friend of mine.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.520]   But I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.160]   but the wizard himself, very close friends,
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.280]   went through a lot of our training together.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.600]   We went to the same fleet squadron.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.800]   He ended up transitioning to be a pilot
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.440]   and then came to where I was instructing.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.960]   So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.880]   And, you know, the way that was,
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.900]   was we went out on a air-to-air training mission.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:33.080]   So simulating a air fight against our own guys.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.240]   They're acting like the bad guys
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.680]   and kind of go head-to-head against each other.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.960]   And when we fly on those missions,
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.520]   we all fly out together, more or less.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.300]   We set up and then we kind of attrite from the fight
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.080]   as we either run out of gas or something happens.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.060]   And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.720]   And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal,
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.000]   they were going back to the boat
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.400]   and we were on what's called a workup training event.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.700]   And so this is like a month on the boat
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.640]   where we're essentially conducting wartime operations,
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.400]   more or less, to stress ourselves out
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:06.280]   and to kind of do the last training block
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.560]   before we go on deployment, essentially.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.340]   So it's pretty high stress.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.780]   They actually do send aircraft from like land bases
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.400]   to kind of try to penetrate
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.000]   and we're expected to go intercept them.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.600]   And so we're kind of practicing like we play.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.680]   And so he saw these objects on the radar,
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.240]   the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.520]   And they initially thought it was part
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.080]   of the training exercise that they were sending something in
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.160]   to try to penetrate the airspace.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.200]   And so they flew over to it.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.600]   And as they got close enough to get on the FLIR,
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.120]   I think everyone has heard the reaction
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.520]   and they realized that it wasn't something
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.120]   they were expecting to see.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.520]   - Can you actually describe what's in the video
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.920]   and what's the reaction in case they haven't seen it?
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.520]   - Yeah, a lot of swearing.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:53.480]   But so what you see on the FLIR footage
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.160]   is a black or white, depending on when you look at it,
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.400]   object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.640]   It appears almost as if someone put two plates together
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.800]   and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.040]   of IR energy at the top of the bottom of those plates
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:09.880]   in a sense.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.200]   So almost as if there's a stick going in between two plates,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.560]   but not that pronounced, right?
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.840]   So there's an energy field that kind of went to a funnel
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.720]   on the top and the bottom,
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.400]   at least that's how it was being portrayed on the FLIR.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.240]   There's a lot of conversation about that being glare
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.080]   and things of that nature,
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.520]   but it was actually a very tight IR image.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.440]   It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.840]   Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft,
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.040]   we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust,
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.400]   especially at those ranges.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.000]   - But there was no flames or there's no exhaust here.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.040]   - There was no exhaust,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.600]   there was no outgassing of propellant in any manner, right?
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.440]   It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.920]   that was stationary in the sky.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.800]   Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.000]   It wasn't falling out of the sky.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.040]   And it continued along if we were to consider it
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.000]   from a God's eye view, again, on the SA page,
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.880]   it continued along in a path.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.820]   And from the perspective, that top down view,
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.160]   it just went in the other direction.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.800]   So no, just an instantaneous direction change
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.040]   from that perspective.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:16.120]   You also hear them very excitedly talking on the tapes
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.000]   about whatever the heck this thing is,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   and look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.880]   And so with SA is a situational awareness page.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.120]   And again, it's a large display
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.920]   that gives that God's eye view of all the radar contacts.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.480]   - So the video is actually showing just one,
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.000]   and then they're speaking about many of them
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.040]   on the SA display.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:38.880]   - Correct.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.600]   And what they essentially saw was,
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.920]   if we were to consider above the object north,
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.400]   so kind of offset to the north of the object,
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.360]   there was a formation of about somewhere between four
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.680]   and six of these objects in a rough wedge formation,
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.520]   so kind of side by side like this.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.440]   And again, not in a autopilot type manner
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.320]   where it was very stiff,
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.680]   it was very kind of non-mechanical,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.640]   the flight mechanics again.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.480]   And these objects were in that formation,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.520]   and they were going along,
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.660]   and then they turned pretty sharply,
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.700]   but they still had a radius of turn,
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.560]   and then went back in the opposite direction.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.320]   And during that turn,
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.840]   they were kind of like all over the place.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.320]   It wasn't tight, they weren't even like super,
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.920]   they weren't flying in a way I would expect them
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.860]   to be flying in relation to a flight lead.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.480]   They were flying as if they were flying close to each other,
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:26.200]   but not in formation, which was kind of strange, right?
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.160]   And then when they rolled out,
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.280]   they kind of tightened backed up,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.760]   like so when they basically,
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.920]   they started that turn and then 180 degrees out,
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.560]   essentially they start flowing in the opposite direction,
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.480]   and kind of got back in that formation.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.800]   And while that was happening,
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.480]   the gimbal object was proceeding,
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.780]   was it left or right?
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:45.840]   And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.320]   and was just passing back it,
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.800]   the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction,
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.040]   so to follow it back in that direction.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.920]   And in the FLIR itself,
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.960]   you see the object changes orientation quite a bit.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.400]   So you see it more or less level,
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.520]   maybe candid about 45 degrees,
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.320]   and then you see it kind of moving around like this,
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.280]   almost as if it was a gimbal.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.980]   I've come to learn after some,
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:13.640]   having seen some research online
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.860]   and people really looking into this,
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:19.020]   that it seemed that the object actually climbed
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.000]   during that maneuver.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.240]   And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.560]   is 'cause it turned like this,
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.740]   it turned in a vertical fashion like that,
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.360]   which is pretty interesting.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.780]   That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.320]   that we don't normally operate
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.060]   because we don't change our directions
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.680]   by maneuvering in the vertical, if we can help it,
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.600]   it's, you're just killing the fuel, you know?
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.820]   And so if you're like a surveillance platform
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.680]   looking to spend as much time around something,
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.240]   you're not gonna climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.480]   - Unless you're Tom Cruise.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.000]   - Unless you're Tom Cruise, naturally.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.080]   - Okay, so is that one of the more impressive
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.360]   flight mechanics you've seen in video forms
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.040]   or not the direct eye sight reports,
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.640]   but like in terms of video evidence that we have?
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.840]   - I think so.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.600]   We were seeing a lot of these,
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.840]   but we weren't just going and recording them all day,
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:13.040]   we just kind of put them in that safety bucket,
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.280]   be like, all right, there's objects over there,
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.200]   we're just not gonna go near it, you know?
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.040]   And so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.360]   We were gathering the data kind of secondarily,
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.280]   but we weren't primarily focusing on it
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.760]   to see all the details, so.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.400]   - That's so fascinating 'cause you have a busy day,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.220]   you have a lot to do, all right,
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.320]   well, there's some weird stuff going on there,
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.680]   we're just not gonna go there.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.120]   And that says something about sort of the,
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.360]   about human nature, about the way that bureaucracies function
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.960]   the way the military functions.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.840]   It fills up your day with busy, important things
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.000]   and you don't get to, I mean, that is something
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.160]   that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about,
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.800]   which is like, we fill our days with so much busyness
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.560]   that when truly beautiful things happen,
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.820]   whatever they are, truly anomalous things,
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.240]   we just won't pay attention
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:07.760]   'cause they don't fit our busy schedule.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.320]   - Beautiful, I think that's right on the nose.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.360]   And it's on my nose because, you know,
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.240]   I didn't give this topic the attention it deserved
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.880]   until I left, right, until I left
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.440]   and I went to be an instructor pilot
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.800]   where I had more time, you know,
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   I had more downtime to kind of process and think
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.440]   and get out of exactly what you just described.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.320]   And that's kind of what broke me out of it
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320]   and got me thinking more about it.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.600]   - Why do you think the DOD released these videos?
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.080]   - It's a great question.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.280]   Did the DOD release it or did they kind of get out
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.520]   on their own in some sense?
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.180]   So I don't know the answer to that question,
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.920]   but my understanding of the situation
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.840]   is that the DOD talked about them so much
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.760]   because they're already out there in a sense.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.480]   And so, you know, they could,
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.040]   they had a choice where they could have just straight up
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.920]   lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.260]   But again, I think our culture now is too open
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:59.560]   and the information moves too freely to do things like that.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.740]   And it kind of left them in a pickle
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:02.680]   that they had to respond to.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.480]   - So what was the role of Pentagon's
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.200]   Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, AATIP?
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:11.260]   From your perspective, from what you know,
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:14.940]   maybe your intuition, is AATIP a real thing that existed?
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.820]   - I was in a position as an aviator
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:20.140]   that never would have exposed me to anything like that.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:22.500]   But I was curious about what people knew.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.120]   And I think in my mind maybe hoped or, you know,
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.860]   hoped someone was looking into this in some sense.
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:31.020]   But on the day that Gimbal was recorded,
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:34.140]   I heard that they caught something extra interesting
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.360]   on the FLIR and I went to the Intel debrief space.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.420]   To go see the film and, you know,
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.300]   everyone's gathered around watching it, very interesting.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.020]   And I heard the Admiral was coming down.
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.820]   And so I was like, I'm gonna hang out back, you know,
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.580]   quietly, mind my own business and see,
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:51.060]   I just wanna see his reaction and try to read it
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.740]   to see if this is brand new or if it is something
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.680]   that they've been dealing with, you know.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.780]   And, you know, he came in and he watched a video
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.900]   for like five or six seconds and went, hmm.
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.220]   And then like turned around and walked out.
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:02.340]   And I, you know, I was like,
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.340]   he's definitely seen these before.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.340]   There's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:08.220]   and don't have more interest.
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.920]   It was, you know, too bizarre.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:12.960]   So kind of going back, does the office exist?
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.260]   Well, you know, I've heard that the Admiral essentially
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:22.700]   reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time,
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.960]   essentially, after he left, right?
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.540]   So he basically went back and I was told he reported that
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.460]   to either AATIP directly or to other, you know,
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.720]   somehow the information got there.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:33.960]   So from my perspective and from what I've experienced,
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.820]   it seems like, yes, it was a thing.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:40.220]   But, you know, as an aviator, I wouldn't know either way.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.940]   Right, that's just my experience from what happened.
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.580]   - But it seems like there's somewhere to report to.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.220]   - At the time, it seemed like there was at least
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.580]   some place to complain to, if not report to.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:54.940]   - Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:57.660]   a serious look at the videos and just the different
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:59.940]   UFO sighting reports.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.860]   So there's a person named Mick West who is a skeptic
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.660]   and tries to take a skeptical view on every single
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.020]   use of evidence on these UFO sightings.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.100]   What do you think about his analysis?
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:14.700]   He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.620]   videos and assign probabilities to their explanations,
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:23.620]   sort of leaning towards things that give a very low
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:29.220]   probability to alien, extraterrestrial type of
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:31.340]   explanations for these UFOs.
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:35.600]   What do you think about his approach to these analysis?
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.340]   - Well, two parts to his approach.
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:39.860]   One, I commend him for all the good work and effort
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.260]   he put into it.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:44.100]   I've seen him build some models and things of that nature.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:46.980]   And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.820]   in this environment.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.620]   No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.140]   Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:58.260]   But where I have a disagreement with his approach
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:02.820]   is that he's approaching from a debunker standpoint,
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:06.160]   and from my perspective, not speaking for everyone,
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.960]   but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:12.320]   towards a particular conclusion,
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.560]   which has been a very safe process for the past X years.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:17.400]   Right?
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.960]   It's been a very safe business to be in to tell people
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.400]   that they haven't seen aliens,
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.940]   but times have changed a little bit.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:28.940]   And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that view
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.420]   on reality has included things such as completely dismissing
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:36.780]   what the air crew are saying.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.780]   And I think that is a fallacy to think that we have to take
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:42.780]   the human outside of that analysis.
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:45.460]   So those are the two things I disagree with.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:48.700]   - When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:51.500]   and you look out there in the vast cosmos,
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.660]   only a small fraction of which we can see,
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:57.540]   how many intelligent alien civilizations
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:58.860]   do you think are out there?
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.220]   Do you think about this kind of stuff?
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.660]   - I do.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.320]   You know, I'm of the theory that we are not
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.160]   the only people out there.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.960]   I think it would be a statistically silly comment
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.280]   to assume we are, although I get that we are
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:11.180]   the only data point that we currently have.
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:14.580]   Although I'm willing to jump over that fence and say that,
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.160]   yes, there most likely is intelligent life elsewhere.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.000]   Although I'll concede that it is a possibility
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]   we are early or it could be limited,
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.520]   or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.120]   or can really understand.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.160]   I spend so much time thinking about
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.080]   how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.320]   And we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense, right?
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.680]   We've trained ourselves what to think about,
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.900]   what we think is true or what this would be like.
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.800]   And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.800]   to a lot of what the possibilities could be
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:49.500]   and the things that we could miss.
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:54.560]   - You beautifully put that the thing that drew you
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:57.160]   to fighter jets is the technology.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.400]   So if you were to think, to imagine
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.840]   from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.600]   would we first encounter as human beings
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.220]   if we were to meet another alien civilization
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.180]   in the next few centuries?
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.840]   What kind of thing would we see?
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.560]   So you're now at the cutting edge
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.100]   and you see the quick progress that's happening.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.880]   That was happening throughout the 20th century,
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.760]   that's happening now with greater degrees of autonomy
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.560]   with robots and that kind of stuff.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.960]   What do you think we will encounter?
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.640]   - I think we're gonna see the ability to manipulate matter
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.640]   like we used to manipulate information.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.080]   Like I think that's what, whether that means
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:41.400]   being able to pop something on the table that didn't exist
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.360]   or to influence a chemical reaction somewhere,
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.340]   but being able to manipulate and treat matter
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.080]   as if it was information.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.720]   And so being able to design specific materials,
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.600]   being able to move past a lot of the barriers
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.660]   that seem to limit our progress with things
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.080]   such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general,
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:07.040]   is a lot of it is matter-based, is material-based
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:11.000]   and our ability to not manipulate,
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.480]   we can only discover materials in a sense.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.540]   And so I think that a complete mastery
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:18.540]   of physical reality would be one of the key traits
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:21.140]   of a very intelligent species.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.960]   - Well, you're actually working on some,
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:23.940]   maybe you can correct me,
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:26.020]   but sort of quantum mechanical simulation
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:28.000]   to understand materials.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.260]   So is that, do you see sort of the early steps
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.780]   that we're doing on quantum computing side
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:37.180]   to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials,
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:39.820]   but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:43.460]   at the very low level that aliens would be able to do
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:46.500]   and hopefully humans would be able to do soon?
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.300]   - Yeah, I think that's, you know,
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:52.260]   so if we think about how, what materials are made of,
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:53.860]   it's just a collection of atoms,
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.760]   but each one of those atoms
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.340]   has a lot of data associated with it.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.840]   So if we wanna kind of calculate
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.900]   how they interact with each other,
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.460]   it requires a massive amount of computational resources,
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.620]   so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.140]   with classical computers.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.100]   And that's where quantum computers come in.
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:10.860]   Although we don't have a perfectly functioning
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:13.100]   quantum computer at this point,
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:14.620]   one of the things that we're working at
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:17.020]   at Quantum General Materials is to essentially bridge
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.620]   that gap between what a classical computer can do
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.340]   as far as simulating materials,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.700]   and of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:26.380]   would mean for being able to design materials.
[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:29.860]   And so, you know, having the ability to study matter
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.140]   at a very fundamental level
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.900]   and unleashing artificial intelligence
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.180]   to machine learning on that problem,
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.800]   I think is, you know, in a sense, you know,
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:40.780]   alien in a way that we're able to advance our science
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:42.460]   using, you know, a process
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.740]   that we may not fully understand
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.340]   with a perhaps a non-human based intelligence
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.180]   in some sense.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:50.260]   And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:52.380]   How does our machine learning output, you know,
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:56.020]   can we match behaviors with what we're observing
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.060]   with what may be a machine learning algorithm with output,
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:54:58.900]   right?
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:54:59.860]   Can we try to classify the intelligence
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.140]   in that manner perhaps?
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.420]   And so, you know, at GenMath,
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.300]   we're looking at these materials,
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.820]   we're considering what these algorithms
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:08.260]   could have used for later on.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.740]   Could we perhaps reverse the process
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:14.060]   and determine what a unique or anomalous material,
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:16.820]   what type of properties it potentially could have?
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.460]   - And you said GenMath, right?
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.380]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.620]   - What is GenMath?
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:24.540]   - GenMath is a quantum generative material.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:27.120]   So it's the company I work for.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.700]   We essentially are working on a couple of verticals.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.980]   One of them is our quantum chemistry work
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:35.840]   where essentially we're bridging the gap
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.260]   between essentially physics and chemistry.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.380]   We're working on those problems
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.700]   and again, implementing artificial intelligence
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.220]   and machine learning into that process
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.100]   so that we can design those materials from the ground up.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.540]   Additionally, we are what we consider
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.620]   a vertically integrated material science company,
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.340]   which means we can generate our own data.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:59.500]   And so within the next quarter coming up,
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.500]   we are launching a satellite in the space.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:05.620]   They'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor in there
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:08.220]   which is intended to be the first launch
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.940]   that will help us detect different types of materials
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.980]   using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.420]   We're gonna be leveraging that experience
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:19.580]   in order to better analyze that data.
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:20.420]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:25.420]   So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:28.540]   - Not necessarily, but we'll be looking back at Earth
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.860]   to be able to detect mineral deposits on Earth.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:31.860]   - Got it, got it.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.340]   Getting the greater perspective from out in space
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:36.420]   to do analysis of different materials.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:37.420]   Interesting.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:40.220]   Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind.
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:41.780]   I got to hang out at DeepMind recently
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.420]   and they really impressed me
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.660]   at the possibility of the application,
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.420]   as you were saying, of machine learning
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:51.560]   in the context of quantum chemical simulation for materials.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.500]   So to understand materials.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:56.340]   It's really, really, really interesting.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:59.820]   So manipulate matter, huh?
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:02.260]   - I would say the next thing is forces, right?
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:03.100]   Or maybe fields.
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:07.540]   So manipulating or managing gravity.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:12.300]   Can we maneuver within fields in some manner
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.060]   that allows us to perhaps move propellant-less
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.020]   or in other manners, right?
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:21.140]   And so I think essentially having a deeper understanding
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:25.140]   of different fields and being able to interact with them,
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:29.660]   I think would be a potential avenue for travel,
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.140]   advanced travel, right?
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:32.500]   Propellant-less travel.
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:36.220]   Can we quantum entangle gravity fields together
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:39.100]   in a propeller ship via the gravity field of a planet,
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.620]   the mass of a planet, in a drive on a ship?
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.060]   There's all sorts of interesting things.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:46.820]   - Yeah, people look back at people like you
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:48.620]   and say, "Wow, they used to fly
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:51.220]   "with this kind of propellant.
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:54.140]   "It seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying."
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.740]   And they were very impressed with themselves,
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:58.580]   these humans, that they could fly like birds.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:02.020]   It's like so much energy is used
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.180]   to fly such short distances from that perspective.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.060]   - We can only throw so many rocks at the back.
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:07.900]   - Yeah. - There needs to be
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.020]   a better way. - Exactly.
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:11.300]   It just seems dumb, like these...
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:12.740]   (both laugh)
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.460]   It's like Flintstones or something like that.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.420]   - We're getting good at it, but there's a limit, right?
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.180]   Like we need to do science. - Getting extremely good.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:21.860]   I mean, that's an interesting sort of trade-off,
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:24.820]   how much do you invest in getting really good at it?
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:29.820]   I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:32.140]   and very powerful to put a human on Mars
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.540]   is not necessarily for the exploration facet,
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:39.380]   but in all the different technologies that come from that.
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.460]   So there's something about putting humans
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.260]   in extreme conditions where we figure out
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.300]   how to make it less extreme, more comfortable,
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.540]   and for that, we invent things,
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:55.340]   like the DoD sort of helping invent the internet
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:58.020]   and all the different technologies we've invented.
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.060]   It's almost like an indirect consequence
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:01.840]   of solving difficult problems,
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.160]   whether that problem means winning wars
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.300]   or colonizing other planets.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:10.460]   And so I don't think Mars will help us figure out
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:13.520]   propulsional systems or to crack open physics
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:16.220]   to where you can travel close to the speed of light
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.780]   or faster than the speed of light,
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.820]   but it will help us figure out
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:23.240]   how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:27.020]   So I'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things,
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.620]   really difficult engineering things
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:32.680]   to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.800]   But let me ask you this.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.600]   Do you think US government is hiding some technology,
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:42.580]   like alien spacecraft technology?
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:46.160]   - I have no information either way.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:49.080]   - And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me.
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.200]   - But my assumptions, you know,
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.640]   like what does my heart tell me?
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:54.760]   My heart tells me something's going on,
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:56.700]   but I have no evidence for that.
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:58.600]   Maybe that's me wanting something to go on.
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.640]   Maybe that's a human feeling to want to know
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:03.000]   that my government's in control
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.340]   of what some strange unknown thing is.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:09.840]   - What's your sense, if such a thing happened,
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:12.760]   would this kind of information leak?
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:15.640]   Would this kind of information be released by the government?
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.940]   I mean, that's the worry that you have
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:18.800]   is because when you don't understand a thing
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:20.680]   and it's novel, you wanna hide it
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:25.080]   so that some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:26.300]   and use it against you.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:29.840]   - I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.600]   It's the one people always jump to,
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.280]   that it's for to maintain secrecy of technology,
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.680]   and I assume that's part of it.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.080]   I wonder if there's any other reasons
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.440]   that we would want to not talk about it.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:43.400]   I imagine that such information would have a shock
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.720]   to the social economic system of any country,
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.120]   if not the world.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.240]   And so I wonder if perhaps that was part
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:53.800]   of the concern as well, how society can react to it.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.040]   Maybe we're anti-fragile enough now
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.780]   with everything that's going on
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.840]   and with our communication networks that,
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:02.760]   why not now?
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:06.140]   I don't know, but that's something I think about as well.
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:10.160]   - Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.600]   of something like this,
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.880]   that there's another intelligence out there
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.100]   who had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic,
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.180]   to have something of this scale,
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:30.880]   basically having just an inkling of a phenomena
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:32.520]   that we have no understanding of
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.400]   and could lead to complete destruction of human civilization
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.040]   or a flourishing of it.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.880]   And what do you do?
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:42.320]   What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.320]   - Yeah, especially when they're the ones
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:45.700]   holding the reins of power,
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.480]   and such a communication would relinquish that power,
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.240]   essentially, to some degree.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.240]   - Since you think there's aliens out there,
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:01.200]   and you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit,
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.320]   do you think alien civilizations,
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.240]   when we meet them, would want war?
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:10.560]   Would they be a danger to us,
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.180]   or would they be a friend to us?
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:16.960]   What's your intuition about intelligences out there?
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:19.960]   - My intuition tells me that when two people
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:23.480]   like yourself and myself or anyone get together,
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.860]   often the output is greater than the individuals.
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:30.520]   And when we work together, we can typically do things
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.000]   that are more impressive and better
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.800]   than if a single person works alone.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:40.680]   And now, I know that war has driven technological progress,
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:46.320]   but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:50.360]   But regardless, I wonder if we truly think
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.240]   about advanced society that has been perhaps
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:55.920]   thousands or millions of years ahead of us,
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.560]   I would imagine that same truth to be there,
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.720]   that people working together, creatures working together,
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.720]   is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.760]   And if we consider that,
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:14.360]   as we imagine a society growing and expanding,
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:17.000]   in a sense, the ultimate output of a planet
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.600]   could only be achieved in some senses
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.040]   if everyone was working towards the same goal.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.320]   And there might be wonders and secrets
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.640]   and things that we can't imagine
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.280]   just simply because of the timeframes
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:30.280]   that we live under and we think in.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.520]   But if a planet has a single unit,
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:36.440]   and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level,
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.720]   if everything's working towards the same output,
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.920]   I could almost imagine an intelligent species
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:43.320]   that approached us planet to planet
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.720]   instead of person to person
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:46.000]   because that's how they've evolved
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.760]   and they've assumed any intelligent species
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.100]   would understand that working together is better than not.
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:55.480]   And so, my heart tells me that at a certain point,
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.280]   love and caring and desire to work together
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.880]   is much more powerful than the technological progress
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.920]   that war would bring.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.000]   - I hope so as well.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.880]   Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you've done.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:13.080]   So you've done research and development efforts
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:14.920]   focused on multi-agent intelligence
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:16.880]   for collaborative autonomy,
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.480]   machine learning AI stuff
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.440]   that we've been talking about for combat,
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.120]   for air-to-air combat,
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.920]   manned-unmanned teaming technologies,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.160]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.520]   What's some interesting ideas in this space
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.260]   that fascinate you?
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.080]   - Randomness.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:35.560]   Being able to not predict what the enemy's doing
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:36.880]   almost no matter what,
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.160]   'cause there's a level of randomness
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.960]   that's within the tactical envelope.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:42.400]   - Utility of randomness.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.840]   - The utility of randomness.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:46.160]   - Sounds like a book you should write.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.120]   (both laugh)
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.280]   - That'd be a good title.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.480]   Name my band.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.020]   - Name your band, yeah.
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:55.360]   So yeah, can you elaborate that?
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.600]   So like trying to deeper understand
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:02.320]   how you can integrate randomness through AI
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.920]   in the context of combat.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:06.200]   - In order to make yourself,
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:07.920]   in order to take away the enemy's ability
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.840]   to try to predict what you're gonna do,
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.680]   to disrupt their technological progress cycles
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:16.160]   so that they don't have a clear target to aim at.
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.720]   And if you don't have a clear target to aim at,
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:18.880]   it's hard to hit it.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.300]   Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:26.120]   So imagine being able to digitally model
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:28.120]   your weapon or your system
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.100]   or your entire tactical engagement or scenario,
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:33.040]   or allow a machine learning to help you
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.240]   better understand the technology
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:36.120]   that you need to build
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.760]   in order to defeat a particular scenario, right?
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:42.560]   And I'm talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:46.560]   And being able to use large amounts of simulation
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:49.240]   and machine learning to build individual assets
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:50.760]   that are small boutique
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:53.920]   using advanced manufacturing techniques
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.120]   for a mission or for a particular battle, right?
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.260]   Instead of just having these large things against an enemy,
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:02.100]   you're building systems and technology for individual cases.
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:06.000]   - What about manned and unmanned teaming?
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000]   So man and machine working together.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.720]   Is there interesting ideas there?
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:13.880]   - I approach it from the position that
[02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:18.000]   the human should be commanding
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.540]   from the highest level possible, right?
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:23.200]   So mission objective based targeting.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.480]   And so if, just for an example,
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:26.900]   if there's a building here
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:28.200]   and I want that building to go away,
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.760]   that's the message I wanna communicate.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.440]   I don't wanna tell certain vehicles
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.400]   to be in a certain spot.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.960]   I don't wanna know how much fuel they have.
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.960]   I don't even wanna know what capabilities they have,
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:36.780]   necessarily.
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.440]   I just wanna know that I have the ability
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.760]   to select from a cloud of capabilities
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.600]   and the right assets are gonna arrive
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.280]   such that they deal with the contingencies
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:49.380]   around the target such as protection systems or EW,
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:50.920]   and then can prosecute the target
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:53.480]   to the high enough probability of satisfaction
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:54.680]   that's needed by the mission.
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:57.200]   - And that's the power of the human mind
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.600]   is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations,
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:03.360]   but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.200]   - Exactly.
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.340]   - That's what humans are good at.
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:08.440]   - Does it worry you a future
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.960]   where we have increasingly higher autonomy
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.440]   in our weapon systems, in our war?
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.620]   So you said building.
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:21.620]   What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:25.760]   to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:29.840]   So you said multiple buildings, region,
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.100]   that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.920]   - So that's a fear, right?
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:41.420]   You're viewing it from a we can cover more perspective,
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:44.220]   which is fair.
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:48.460]   And a lot of, I don't approach it from that topic.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.060]   At least I don't think of it that way, at least morally.
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:54.140]   I think that with the advancement of warfare,
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:57.900]   assuming we have a just and moral leadership,
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:00.220]   if that's the case,
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:04.580]   then I am an advocate for increased autonomy and technology
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:08.980]   because I see it as an ability to be more precise.
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.980]   And if we trust the moral leadership of our government,
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:17.460]   then we would want to be as precise as possible
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:21.100]   in order to mitigate effects that we don't want.
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.460]   So I know that's not a satisfying answer
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.140]   and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings, but.
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.900]   - No, because having experienced sort of
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:36.240]   directly seen what it looks like
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.720]   when deliberately or carelessly
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.480]   war leads to the death of a large number of civilians
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:46.680]   as it does currently in Ukraine,
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.060]   the value of precision,
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:54.200]   given ethical leadership, becomes apparent.
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:57.320]   So there's something distinctly unethical
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.920]   about the murder of civilians in a time of war.
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:06.000]   And I think technology helps lessen that.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.480]   Of course, all death is terrible,
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.480]   but there's something about schools, hospitals,
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.500]   being destroyed with everybody inside being killed.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:21.280]   It's particularly terrible.
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.480]   - It is.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.720]   And you approached it from the angle of
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:29.720]   more autonomy enables a wider swath of destruction.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.480]   And that's where we get back into,
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:34.960]   who's making the decisions based off of this?
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:37.680]   And my hope, again, would be that
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:39.640]   we would have the leadership that would use these things
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:42.960]   when needed in the precise way as possible to minimize that.
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.520]   And I've seen that firsthand.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:45.800]   I've seen that in country.
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:49.400]   I've seen, not blue forces,
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.080]   but I've seen truck bombs go off on school buses,
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.840]   driving around Afghanistan while escorting convoys.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.700]   And it wasn't easy then,
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:01.800]   and I'm sure it's not any easier now,
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.880]   especially after what you've just seen.
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.200]   - Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine,
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.560]   maybe from a military perspective,
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.340]   maybe from the Air Force perspective?
[02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:13.760]   So I could just mention a few things.
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.880]   There's the Baraktar drones that are being used.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:18.980]   They're unmanned.
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.560]   I think they have capability to be autonomous,
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.880]   but they're usually remotely controlled.
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:25.460]   They're used for reconnaissance,
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:28.560]   but they're also used by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance.
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.440]   And I think also to destroy different technologies,
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.200]   tanks and so on, different targets like this.
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.040]   So there's also on the Russian side, the oil and tan,
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.960]   there's the fighter jets,
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.440]   MiG-29 in the Ukraine side,
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.420]   and the Su-25 in the Russian side.
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.080]   Is there anything kind of stands out to you
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.600]   about this particular aspects of what this war looks like
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.640]   that's unique to what you've experienced?
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.600]   - Maybe not unique,
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:56.780]   but it's just been absolutely incredible
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:59.240]   to see the footage.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.740]   I mean, we're watching war on Twitter, essentially,
[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:06.180]   and to see these aircraft flying down low,
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.920]   spitting flares out, getting shot down,
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:11.080]   it's incredible to see this happening
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.500]   live for everyone to see.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:16.220]   So that's just kind of a quick meta comment.
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:18.580]   But as far as the actual,
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.740]   I think these small form factor UAVs
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:22.900]   where they're just like strapping weapon to it
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:25.360]   and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time,
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:29.880]   or any of these type of commercial applications of technology
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:33.160]   into this ad hoc warfare area is incredibly interesting
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:36.500]   'cause it shows how useful that technology can be
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:40.120]   outside of the military, especially like DGI.
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.680]   There's obviously a lot of technology in there
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:43.640]   is being leveraged for other capabilities
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:47.800]   within PLC military, or at least we would assume.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.560]   What happens if that is more widespread?
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:54.520]   What if we were creating our own drones
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.040]   and they were being used against us?
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.680]   Would we want to have some type of kill switch
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:58.760]   or something like that?
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.680]   So I think governments are gonna have to consider
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.420]   all these tools that are gonna be easily available
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:08.040]   to just any person could be turned into a tool of war.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.480]   How do we stop that from being turned against us?
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.960]   Especially as we look at 10 years from now
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.480]   when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.640]   delivering packages and doing everything else
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:19.520]   over our country, and any one of those
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.760]   could be potentially a weapon
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.500]   if we don't have the proper security.
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:27.060]   - Well, we're now in Texas, and Texas values its guns
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:30.160]   and it sees guns as, among other things,
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.480]   a protector of individual freedom.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:35.480]   You could see a future perhaps where,
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.240]   and I've certainly experienced this
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.440]   in the empowering nature of this in Ukraine,
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.940]   where you can put the fight for independence
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:50.140]   into your own hands by literally strapping explosives
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:54.240]   to GGI drones that you purchase on your own salary.
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:55.560]   I mean, one of the interesting things
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.240]   about the Voluntary Army in Ukraine
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.080]   is that they're basically using their own salary
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.160]   to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:07.640]   That's the very kind of ideal that sort of people speak
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:11.200]   about when they speak about the Second Amendment
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.960]   in this country, that it's interesting to see
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.920]   the advanced technology version of that,
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.360]   especially in Ukraine, sort of using
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:24.680]   computer vision technology for surveillance
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:26.800]   and reconnaissance to try to,
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:31.120]   and integrate that information to discover the targets
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:32.820]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:35.420]   to put that in the hands of civilians,
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:36.480]   it's fascinating to see.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.600]   So to sort of fight for their independence,
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:43.600]   you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:45.360]   of your own government, all that kind of stuff.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.360]   - It shows you how complicated the war space
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.440]   in the future is gonna be, invading a land like that
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.440]   where people have that many different types of resources,
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.720]   it's gonna absolutely change warfare.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.720]   - I mean, hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.400]   to go to war with a, yeah,
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.080]   sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.320]   - It does, yeah.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.480]   I don't think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:14.060]   quite as long as he has, of course,
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:16.480]   but it can show you how you can get caught up.
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:21.480]   If land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.520]   due to the complications around the society's ability
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.760]   to access interesting tools,
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:33.980]   it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:38.600]   - Well, let me ask you about this.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:41.160]   Do you think there will always be war in the world?
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:45.500]   Is this just a part of human nature?
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.100]   (silence)
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:51.540]   - I think so.
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.620]   I think it is.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:58.080]   Until we move past resource limitation,
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.220]   there's always gonna be at least that one particular cause
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:04.980]   of conflict.
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:09.320]   And then we can also consider all our psychological,
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:14.940]   lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:18.860]   Although, hopefully we have enough things in place
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:22.200]   to stop that from rising to the level of war.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.420]   But we have our own biology,
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:25.560]   our own psychology and evolution to combat.
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:28.320]   But there are pragmatic reasons
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.400]   to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately,
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:33.520]   and one of those cases could be resource limitations.
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.780]   And so while your question was,
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:37.100]   do I think there'll always be war in this world?
[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:39.540]   My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes,
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:41.620]   but once there's more than one world
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:43.060]   and we're less resource constrained,
[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:45.780]   then perhaps there'll be a valve of sorts for that.
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.900]   - I talked to Jocko on this podcast.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:55.540]   I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:56.940]   by Dire Straits.
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:59.720]   And the question I asked him,
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:01.460]   I'd like to ask you the same question,
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:05.020]   is like the song goes,
[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:07.140]   do you think we're fools to wage war
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.260]   on our brothers in arms?
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:10.860]   And Jocko said,
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:14.180]   our enemy is not our brothers in arms,
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:15.220]   they're the enemy.
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:21.220]   And so this kind of notion that we're all human,
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:25.140]   that's a luxury you can have.
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:28.100]   But there is good and bad in this world,
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:29.620]   according to Jocko.
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:32.860]   I hear that anger and hate,
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:34.940]   when I was in Ukraine,
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:36.860]   amongst some people,
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:40.900]   where there was a sense
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.400]   where you could be brothers and sisters,
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.300]   you can have family,
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:47.220]   you can have love from Ukraine to Russia.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.140]   But now that everything's changed
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:54.880]   and generational hate for some people have taken over.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.540]   So I guess the question is,
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:59.180]   when you think about the enemy,
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.260]   is there hate there?
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:04.420]   Do you acknowledge that they're human?
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.660]   - I had never had any hate or discontent,
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:10.300]   when I was doing my job, I'll say.
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:14.660]   But I was also never in a true life or death situation
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:17.260]   where they were gonna kill me if I didn't kill them.
[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:22.500]   But I think that environment isn't one born out of hate,
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.460]   being in that type of scenario,
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:27.340]   since it's how to be alive, right?
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:30.020]   I mean, our natural state is be fighting
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.820]   for survival in a sense.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:35.180]   And so I think there's great power and strength
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.860]   and clarity perhaps in that.
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:39.060]   And it's not always born out of hate,
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:40.140]   but out of necessity.
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:42.340]   And we can't always control that.
[02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:46.540]   And I think as we focus on ourselves so much,
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.220]   we only dance on that pinhead
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:51.940]   when we find ourselves fighting for things that we need.
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:54.700]   And we're always taking from someone else at this point.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:57.500]   And so as someone that's been in combat
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:59.540]   and very high above it, I'll say, right?
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:02.180]   Where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:07.860]   I rationalized it and I made my way through it
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:09.540]   knowing that there were people on the other side
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:13.380]   that were going to die that were on our side than not.
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:15.860]   So it was always a very human thing.
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:20.860]   It was never a reaction, emotional reaction of any sense.
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:25.860]   - So you were able to see the basic,
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:28.020]   it's human versus human.
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:31.260]   There's some aspect of war that is basically
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:34.740]   one people fighting each other.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:37.300]   - Yes.
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:42.360]   At the end of the day, especially I would say in aviation,
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:44.500]   tactical aviation, there's almost a kinship
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.340]   with your enemies in a sense,
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:49.100]   because you know them in a sense, right?
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:51.660]   You know what they've been through.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:52.900]   You know what training they've been through.
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.660]   You know where they've failed.
[02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:56.540]   And you know what type of person they are,
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:58.300]   'cause there's a very unique person that does that job
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:18:59.900]   and usually can spot them.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:02.500]   - I guess it's the kind of respect you have
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.900]   for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on.
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:07.740]   - Certainly.
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.100]   And that person didn't come out in his $100 million jet
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:12.220]   because I pissed them off.
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:13.940]   It's not an emotional response.
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:17.940]   We're both there, maybe because we chose to be in some sense,
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:20.780]   but at the behest of someone else
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.980]   and outside of our control and power.
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.940]   So in a sense for me, it's almost a challenge
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:28.140]   that we've engaged upon agreeably,
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:29.740]   but that's such a romantic version
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:33.260]   that I have the luxury to have being high in my castle
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:35.580]   in the jet up there, not on the ground.
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:37.680]   So I understand that it's a bit more romantic
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:40.940]   than perhaps someone on the ground
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:42.860]   experiencing all the horrors down there,
[02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:45.160]   'cause everything looks very small from above.
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:50.180]   - And that's another aspect of war with greater autonomy,
[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:52.380]   when you're controlling the mission versus
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:58.380]   you know, have a Genghis Khan type of intimacy
[02:19:58.380 --> 02:20:01.700]   in terms of the actual experience of war
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:05.260]   where you directly have, you murder with a sword
[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:09.460]   versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone
[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:12.060]   versus a strategic mission assignment
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:14.900]   to an autonomous drone that executes.
[02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:17.580]   - Abstracted away until it's just a small decision.
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:23.220]   And my worry is the people without a voice
[02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:29.140]   are completely forgotten and silenced
[02:20:29.140 --> 02:20:31.020]   in all of these calculations.
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:34.840]   I spoke to a lot of people, poor people,
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:37.740]   they feel like they've never really had a voice
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:40.260]   and they're too easily forgotten,
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:42.500]   even within the country of Ukraine.
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:47.500]   It's the big city versus the rural divide, you know.
[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:49.820]   It's easy to forget the people
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:52.300]   that don't have a Twitter account
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:57.100]   and that their basic existence is just trying to survive,
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:58.500]   trying to put food on the table
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:00.640]   and they don't have anything else.
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:03.540]   Anything else and they are the ones
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:06.100]   that truly feel the pain of war,
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:08.300]   of the supply chain going down,
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:10.100]   of the food supplies going down,
[02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:12.900]   of a cold winter without power.
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:18.060]   You're still young, but you've seen some things.
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:22.620]   - So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:25.840]   and give advice to young people.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:29.180]   Whether they're fascinated by technology
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.860]   or fascinated by fighter jets,
[02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:35.220]   whether they're fascinated by sort of engineering
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:38.060]   or the way the stars look at night,
[02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:40.100]   what advice would you give them?
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:42.060]   How to have a career they can be proud of
[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:44.160]   or how to have a life they can be proud of?
[02:21:45.420 --> 02:21:49.780]   - I'd suggest that they don't fear looking foolish.
[02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:52.220]   I spent a large portion of my life
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:58.260]   considering the laughter or the comments at my statements
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:01.000]   as indication that I shouldn't pursue that.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.900]   And so, I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later,
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:08.900]   but I would encourage, I would advise
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:11.000]   that people trust in themselves
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.920]   and trust in the things that they care about.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:15.560]   It doesn't matter if they're good at it.
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:17.440]   All that matters is that they find something
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:20.400]   that they can apply love and care to
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.240]   and they will grow better at it
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:25.080]   and then most likely make the world better because of it.
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:27.420]   - And don't be afraid to look stupid.
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:29.080]   - Don't be afraid to look stupid.
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:31.480]   - Yeah, that's one of the things that I think
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:34.880]   as you get older, you're expected to be,
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.000]   to have it all figured out
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.040]   and so you are afraid to take on new things.
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:40.800]   But I think as long as you're always,
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.400]   okay, looking stupid and having a beginner's mind,
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:47.000]   you can get really, really far even later on in life.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.760]   So this isn't just advice for young people.
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:52.460]   This is really advice for everybody.
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:58.720]   Maybe a dark question, but has there been
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:01.480]   a difficult time in your life,
[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:03.640]   a really dark place you've gone in your mind
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:07.200]   that stands out that you had to really overcome?
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:11.080]   - I would suggest that I've been
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:14.120]   pretty firm ground for most of my life.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:18.840]   I haven't had too many personal tragedies, I'll say,
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:21.580]   that have really defined me.
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:25.760]   Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:29.000]   - So there is no truly low point?
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.640]   - Actually, I have one and it's tough for me
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:33.880]   because I've spent most of my life beating emotions
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.640]   and high emotional responses out of my system,
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:40.040]   'cause that's what flying is.
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:43.400]   It's keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:45.880]   In fact, there's been studies that have shown
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:49.440]   reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:50.720]   for a number of years after they get out.
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:54.360]   But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:56.080]   and I wasn't expecting it to be.
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:59.480]   A lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military,
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.520]   especially in the fighter community.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.600]   We all have our plans made up to get out
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:08.080]   and none of it really accounts for any type of mental health
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:08.920]   or anything like that.
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:11.560]   It's all very much, where am I gonna get my paycheck from?
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.680]   Where am I gonna move to?
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.400]   And whether it's the Navy or just individuals,
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.320]   truly understanding the difference that makes.
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.040]   And when I got out, it was difficult for me.
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.160]   I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out,
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:26.280]   they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:29.920]   because I was so used to being highly involved
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:34.920]   in something that, just was I was always involved with
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:37.680]   that when I got out, I didn't know how to fill that space,
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.780]   essentially, you know?
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:41.320]   And while I wouldn't say it was
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:42.720]   an overly traumatic experience,
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:45.160]   I think it's one that's not accounted for enough
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.880]   that people that are getting out,
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.160]   so I would encourage them to take it serious
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:51.680]   and actually think about it and respect the change
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.480]   'cause it is a big one.
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:58.480]   - Well, if I may say, you found a place in nature currently,
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.960]   a home, is there, can you speak to that
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:04.080]   being a source of happiness for you?
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:04.920]   - Absolutely.
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:06.240]   - An escape from the world?
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.080]   - Certainly, very much is.
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.280]   - Was it deliberate that you found it there?
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:12.120]   - That's home for me.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.920]   So, you know, I moved back up to the Boston area
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:18.440]   and my wife and I had an idea after moving
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.280]   about eight or nine times in the Navy
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.560]   of kind of what we wanted just generally.
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.760]   And it was all really about the land
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.920]   and not about the house, you know?
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:29.520]   We just wanted privacy and to be nearby.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.680]   And so we ended up finding a lot of land,
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:34.200]   you know, a parcel of land, we put a house on it
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:36.560]   and it provides me with a sense of peace
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:40.240]   that I think I can only get when I'm in nature.
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:44.680]   A sense of clarity that helps me think, helps me relax,
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:46.640]   maybe it's the relaxing that helps me think, I don't know.
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.640]   But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.920]   for me has always allowed me to, I don't know,
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:59.320]   feel most in touch with my own thoughts in a sense.
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:01.280]   It just provides clarity.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:04.640]   And so this little sanctuary you could say I've built
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:08.480]   allows me to, you know, interface via a fiber line
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.080]   at my house, but also feel like I'm a million miles away
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:13.880]   sometimes, which is the best of both worlds.
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:16.280]   - And you can just walk outside to escape it all.
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:17.120]   - Yes.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.480]   - To experience life as hundreds of generations
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.520]   of human species have experienced it.
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:24.640]   - Maybe it's the dichotomy.
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.520]   My desire for the vastness of technology and experience
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:31.360]   compared with the most basic baseline that we have.
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.120]   - Isn't that strange?
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:34.880]   How do you square that?
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.080]   - I don't know.
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:38.080]   - How drawn you are to the cutting edge
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:41.360]   and still the calm you find in nature.
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:42.480]   - I think it makes sense.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:45.720]   Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:46.560]   - From a technology perspective?
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.080]   - Yeah, it is.
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.200]   And so in a way it's being surrounded by perfection
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:51.160]   in a lot of senses.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.120]   - In the military and in general,
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.200]   have you contemplated your mortality?
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.960]   Have you been afraid of death?
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.040]   What's your relationship like with death?
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:06.120]   - I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk,
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:08.480]   I'll say, when I was younger as an aviator.
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:10.560]   Not in the jet, but just that was my life.
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:13.560]   You know, I felt like I was gonna live forever.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.720]   And going out in the war, you know, strangely,
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:18.400]   didn't really change that because, you know,
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.240]   as an aviator, again, we're riding up high
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:21.600]   on our horse up there, so.
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:25.680]   There were times when I was in situations
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:28.240]   that could have resulted in death from flying
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:33.240]   or from emergency in the aircraft, but I'll be honest,
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:36.560]   I never really kind of sat down to think about
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:39.280]   the mortality of it afterwards.
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:41.920]   I feel like I kind of signed a check at the beginning
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:44.240]   and it was my job to perform as well as I could.
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:46.000]   And if something happened in that,
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.640]   then I better damn well be sure
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:49.440]   I would do my best at the time then.
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:53.680]   So, you know, I maybe didn't personally reflect on it
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.240]   as much as one would think, you know,
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:58.800]   'cause once you get in that machine,
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.280]   it doesn't give you a lot of time to sit back
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:04.960]   and philosophize on your current situation.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.800]   And the same, just like we weren't seeing these,
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:08.520]   or when we seen these objects off the coast,
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.800]   we weren't necessarily examining them every day, right?
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:12.760]   We'd put them into that bucket because it wasn't something
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:14.800]   that was gonna kill us right away.
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:17.760]   And thinking about death when you're so close to it
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:19.520]   all the time would be debilitating.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:22.480]   - It would probably make you worse at your job.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:23.320]   - It would.
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:26.720]   - Well, maybe you can think about death
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.320]   when you look out when you go out into nature
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.880]   and think like the fact that this whole ride ends,
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.800]   it's such a weird thing, and the old makes way to new.
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:39.240]   And that's all throughout nature.
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.080]   And if you just look at the cruelty of nature
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:44.600]   or the beauty of nature, however you think about it,
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.680]   the fact that the big thing eats the little thing
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.440]   over and over, and that's just how it progresses.
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:55.680]   And that's how adaptation happens.
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:59.500]   - Death is a requirement for evolution.
[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:02.560]   And whether evolution allows us
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:04.600]   to see objective reality or not,
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:06.600]   it still gives you some interesting thoughts
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:08.320]   about perspectives of death,
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:11.720]   and especially concerning its biological necessity
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:13.760]   as far as evolution is concerned.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.600]   - Yeah, it's weird.
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:18.520]   It's weird that there's been like 100 billion people
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:22.120]   that lived before us, and that you and I will be forgotten.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:23.920]   This whole thing we're doing right now
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:25.920]   is meaningless in that sense,
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:28.760]   but at the same time, it feels deeply meaningful somehow.
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:32.880]   I guess that's the question I wanna ask.
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:36.000]   When you go out to nature with family,
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.720]   what do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:40.080]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:44.360]   Or maybe when you put on the night goggles,
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:47.120]   the night vision goggles and look up at the stars.
[02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:49.340]   Why are we here?
[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:51.880]   - I can't speak for everyone,
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:54.520]   but at least the way I interpret it,
[02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:58.560]   or at least I feel like I interpret my way here,
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:02.280]   my job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.640]   about the environment in a manner that allows us
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.040]   to understand as much as possible.
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.640]   I think that the human mind,
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:12.360]   whether it's just the mass inside our skull,
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:14.520]   or whether there's some type
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:16.720]   of quantum interactions going on,
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:21.440]   our mind has incredible ability to output new information.
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:26.440]   And in a universe that is somewhat stale of information,
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:30.960]   our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:33.280]   and perceive things that could never, ever
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:35.240]   have possibly naturally occurred,
[02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.320]   and yet we can make it happen.
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:38.960]   We can instantiate that with enough belief
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.880]   that it's true and it can happen.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.480]   And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that,
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.480]   to encourage interaction with reality such that it leaves us
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:52.640]   in newer and grander interactions with this universe.
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.480]   - And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.
[02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:57.120]   - Exactly.
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.080]   - Ryan, you're an incredible person.
[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:00.320]   You've done so many things,
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:03.520]   and there's so much still ahead of you.
[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:06.680]   Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs
[02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:09.220]   and doing it so seriously,
[02:31:09.220 --> 02:31:11.460]   and thank you for pushing forward on all these fronts
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:12.840]   in terms of technology.
[02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:17.720]   So from just the fighter jets, the engineering of that,
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:21.040]   to the AI/ML applications in the combat setting,
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:24.440]   that's super interesting, and then now quantum.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:26.600]   I can't wait to see what you do next.
[02:31:26.600 --> 02:31:28.360]   Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:29.200]   It was an honor.
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:30.020]   - It was my pleasure.
[02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:31.360]   Thank you, Lex.
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.080]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:34.920]   with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:36.320]   To support this podcast,
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:39.080]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:42.160]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:47.240]   Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:51.360]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:53.940]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:56.520]   (upbeat music)
