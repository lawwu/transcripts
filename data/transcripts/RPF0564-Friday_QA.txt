[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.620]   - Hi Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.780]   So I, just to give you my background a little bit,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780]   I'm 23 years old and I do have some seasonal employment.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.080]   I work in Arizona as a wildland firefighter
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.760]   for the summer months.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.480]   And I've been doing that for,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680]   this will be my third season doing that
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.120]   and kind of taking odd jobs in the winter.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   But last winter I worked at a ski resort
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.960]   as a supervisor for food and beverage.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   And I have about 20,000 or 25,000 in a mutual fund
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.720]   that was originally a college fund for me,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.280]   but I ended up going to a two-year college
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.500]   so didn't use a lot of that money.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.380]   And now I'm kind of looking at possibly
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.400]   buying a rental property or a home for myself.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.440]   But kind of wondering your thoughts on
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.160]   maybe if there's a better place to put that money for now
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.680]   or once I figure out if I can qualify for a mortgage,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.440]   the best route of going about something like that.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.980]   - How much money do you earn on an annual basis?
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.260]   - Roughly about 40 to 45,000.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.180]   - Okay.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.660]   And do you intend to increase that?
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.620]   Do you have plans to increase that?
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.820]   What's your plan with regard to your income?
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.040]   - Yeah, I'd like to increase it,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   but with the seasonal employment that I have now,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.500]   with the government, since it's with the Forest Service,
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.340]   it would be kind of a standard hourly rate
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.580]   and it's kind of varying on overtime hours
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.460]   and everything like that.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.180]   So more of that, trying to increase my income
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.580]   would probably have to come in the winter
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.980]   or I'd have to kind of shift
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.780]   where what I want to be doing with my time, I guess.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.440]   - So I guess my first concern would be at 23 years old,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.900]   I would encourage you to first focus on
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.060]   building your income.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.980]   And it's up to you how you do that.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.540]   There's a balance here between me trying to
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.420]   encourage you to build your income
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.700]   versus me trying to encourage you to enhance your lifestyle.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.340]   But at 23, I would encourage you that
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.420]   one of the most valuable things you can do is build income.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.900]   Now that doesn't have to be at the cost of lifestyle.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.740]   You can do seasonal firefighting work,
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.660]   which is, I would love,
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.500]   it would be very much appeal to me,
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.020]   but you probably also need to have some other plan.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.500]   Now that plan could be many things,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.480]   but you need to have a plan.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.720]   That plan could be rental properties.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.740]   That plan could be some sort of other seasonal work,
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.580]   something that happens in the wintertime,
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.620]   some business that you do during the wintertime.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.900]   That plan can be up to you.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.300]   You can build your life however you want.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.260]   But your first priority at 23 should be to
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.300]   focus on building a high income,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.400]   because that will make a lot of decisions
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.860]   down the road easier.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.400]   Now, once you've built a high income
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.340]   and then have developed an investment portfolio,
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.820]   then it's a little bit more appropriate
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.920]   for you to back off and say,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.940]   okay, now I'm gonna do this seasonal employment.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.460]   And if you have an investment portfolio behind you,
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.860]   and you can just work seasonally
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.740]   and earn $45,000 a year fighting wildland fires,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.460]   then that could be great.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.580]   But you need that, I think you need that bigger plan.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.880]   So if you're just asking the question of,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.620]   should I buy a rental property with the money,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.140]   or should I buy my own house,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.880]   or should I do something else?
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.140]   My first question is, what's your income plan?
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.820]   And if you have a way or an idea
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.460]   about developing an income plan,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.060]   and if you need money for that,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.020]   then you should save that money for your income plan.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   Whether that could be your own business.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.400]   Sometimes if you are working seasonally,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.220]   one of the best ways for you to be able
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.140]   to maintain your seasonal work
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.600]   and to earn during the off season
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.100]   is to run your own business.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.240]   Unless you're working in an occupation
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.820]   that's naturally only done during the winter,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.760]   you drive, I don't know, snow, you're in Arizona,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.020]   so you're not gonna drive snow piles.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.740]   But the point is, unless you are working
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.460]   something that's automatically seasonal,
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.860]   you might need some work that you can really hit it hard
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.660]   for six months of the year,
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.420]   you have a month off on the shoulder season
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.660]   until fire season, then you go and do fire season,
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.540]   and then you have a month off,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.100]   and then you hit your business again.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.820]   So if you need the money to develop a business,
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.820]   that could be great.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.980]   But there's no reason why you couldn't also use the money
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.700]   for a rental property.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.020]   If you only give me the two options,
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.880]   a rental property versus a house to live in,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.140]   I don't think you need a house to live in,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.180]   I think you need a rental property.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.540]   At 23 years old, half the year,
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.620]   or for the months that you're on fire season,
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.700]   you're sleeping in a tent on the ground,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.620]   or you're in some barracks somewhere,
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.900]   you don't need a house then.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.440]   And the other six months of the year,
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.900]   just live in a friend's bedroom, spare bedroom,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.140]   buy a truck camper and live in that, something like that.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.500]   Build your wealth at this stage of life,
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.180]   I don't think you need a big fancy house.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.900]   Unless you take a house and you buy a house
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.380]   and you fill it with a bunch of roommates,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.420]   and you just keep one little room on the back corner
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.700]   and available for yourself,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.260]   I don't see any reason for you to own a house
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.140]   at 23 years old and young and single.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.980]   Make sense?
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.900]   - Right, yeah, that does make a lot of sense, yeah.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   That's kind of more towards what I was thinking originally,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.340]   also, is, yeah, I wouldn't think it'd be more important,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.540]   but I know there are a couple,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.060]   or I've heard of things like your first mortgage,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.860]   there's certain advantages to it or something,
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.060]   so I don't know if maybe waiting to buy something
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.300]   worth a little more money might be to an advantage
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.140]   tax-wise or something like that later on.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.660]   - Yeah, so you could, so it comes down to kind of
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.180]   what you're buying and how you're gonna finance it.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.620]   And here would be the type of thing that would be,
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.780]   that you should consider,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.260]   a couple of different real estate strategies.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.220]   So first of all,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.940]   you can, if you're buying a house for your first time house,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.780]   you can purchase a house under what's called the FHA,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.540]   First Time Home Buyers Association,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.380]   is that what it's called?
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.940]   FHA loan, basically it's a loan for your first time house.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.700]   And that can be an advantage for you
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.660]   because you can qualify for the loan
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.460]   with an income of $40,000, you can qualify for a loan.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.340]   It would be a modest loan, but you can qualify for a loan.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.540]   One of the benefits of an FHA loan
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.540]   is you only need to put down a very small amount of money.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.860]   If memory is right, it's something like 3%,
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.340]   but the specific number is easily available to you
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.160]   with a quick online search.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.820]   So you only need to put down a small amount of money,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.940]   and now you can control a property.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.340]   And as a primary residence that you're living in,
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.460]   and with a primary residence that you've bought
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.100]   as an FHA buyer, you could control a property
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.320]   with a very low outlay of cash,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.420]   with good financing terms as a first time home buyer.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.860]   And as long as that is your primary residence,
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.580]   then you put yourself in a situation
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.820]   where you can rent out a bunch of bedrooms.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.340]   And that, I wouldn't, that's just to me,
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.440]   that's a tactic that you can use
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.140]   that basically comes down under the idea
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.220]   of I'm buying a rental property.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.860]   That's essentially what you're doing.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.540]   And so you can buy that house
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.220]   and you can park a camper in the back corner of it
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.420]   and rent out, buy a four bedroom house
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.340]   and rent out four bedrooms to four of your buddies.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.060]   And that can be a very effective thing for you to do.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.900]   So that's a tactic that can be used,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.140]   but basically you're still buying a rental property.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.820]   What I'm trying to discourage you from
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.780]   is the idea of buying a house
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.440]   that is gonna be a big three bedroom house
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.820]   with a beautiful deck out back,
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.740]   and you're gonna keep the whole thing empty
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.520]   just so you have a beautiful place to live.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.220]   That seems like a waste to me.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.500]   At this point in your life,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.020]   more important for you to focus on building your wealth
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.620]   at this point in your life.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.860]   If you're handy, one of the benefits I would say
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.080]   is if you're handy, don't neglect the value
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.220]   of your being able to apply yourself to your work
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.960]   on a seasonal basis.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.620]   If you're a firefighter, there's a good chance
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.360]   you have exposure at least to other blue collar type
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.460]   of people who are experienced in the trades.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.660]   And being a part-time handyman,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.580]   being a part-time home renovator
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.540]   can be a very effective way for you to use your off season.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.300]   Your firework season can be a stable form of income for you.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.660]   And then for the other six months
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.940]   that you're not doing firework,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.220]   then go ahead and apply yourself to fixing up a house,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   buying an inexpensive house,
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.060]   buying a rental property every couple of years,
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.940]   fixing them up, renting them out,
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.520]   doing work for other people.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.040]   That's a really appropriate form of seasonal work
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.540]   that's very flexible that could be a good fit
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.580]   if you've developed some of those skills.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.300]   - Yeah, yeah, I agree.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.420]   I wouldn't wanna buy a big house or anything like that
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.580]   and not be renting it.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.740]   That would be the primary reason to buy the house
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.620]   would be to get some, you know,
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.440]   have it pay it kind of for itself in a sense.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.820]   - Right, and the FHA loan can get you there.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.700]   My understanding of the rules, it's gotta be your house.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.580]   So you gotta plan to live there.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.880]   But different people's definitions of living in a place
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.140]   are certainly subject to interpretation.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.420]   I don't have a problem if I'm receiving mail at a place
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.380]   and I'm there frequently and I'm using that address
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.940]   for some purposes as far as I'm concerned,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.320]   I'm living there.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.180]   You can adjust accordingly in terms of how much
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.140]   you can rent out, how many bedrooms,
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.720]   how much space you actually need
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.300]   for the entirety of the year.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.500]   Read the contract and make sure you follow it,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.940]   but use whatever's subject to your own interpretation
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.060]   for your own benefit.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.460]   Travis in Kentucky, welcome to the show.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.700]   How can I serve you, sir?
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.420]   - Yeah, thank you for taking my call, Joshua.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.300]   Appreciate the show, you do a great job.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.780]   - Thank you.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.220]   - My question is, I just started a small business.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.180]   It's an ambulatory veterinary practice here.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.420]   And I have yet to set up a retirement.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.940]   You are my only employee and I'm the only person
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.980]   that I ever plan on.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.300]   And going through and looking at the different options,
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.180]   I think that I've arrived at a decision,
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.980]   but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.260]   as far as what type of retirement account
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.020]   to open within the business for myself
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.420]   in order to maximize the opportunity.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.060]   And I guess I just kind of wanted to run by
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.900]   and get your take to make sure I wasn't missing anything.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.180]   I think for my situation that a solo 401k
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   would be what I would want because I can put the most away
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.140]   as quickly as possible, which is my goal.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.460]   But I wanted to make sure that there wasn't any other reason
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:00.020]   to take a second look at doing a SEP or a simple IRA
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.180]   or something like that.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.940]   - Sounds like your analysis is right on track.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.780]   So in your own business where you have no employees
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.980]   and you don't intend to have employees,
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.820]   then you basically have three retirement plans
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.020]   available to you.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.500]   Those three plans are a SEP IRA, a simple IRA,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.620]   and an individual 401k or a solo 401k.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.620]   And the benefits largely come down
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.580]   to how much money you wanna put in
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.300]   and in what format you want to put it in.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.740]   Thankfully today, they're all fairly easy to do.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.460]   They're all fairly simple.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.180]   So let's start with a SEP IRA.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.260]   The SEP IRA is,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.580]   SEP stands for Simplified Employee Pension Program, I think.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.540]   And the basic benefit of the SEP IRA is it's dirt simple
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.020]   and you can make your contribution
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.660]   after the calendar year is over.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.580]   The SEP IRA, any investment broker
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.180]   will have a standard boilerplate SEP IRA
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.700]   where they just say, "Here's the form,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.060]   you sign it and you have an IRA."
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.580]   You can make your contribution at the end of the tax year,
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.620]   which is one of the benefits.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.340]   The SEP IRA in the financial planning business,
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.020]   we always called those the accountant's best friend.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.140]   Because if your tax accountant is doing your taxes
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.500]   on April 14, and they're trying to get you
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.540]   to put some money in a retirement account,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.020]   you can call your investment broker on April 14
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.020]   and you can open that account online and boom,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.020]   it's fundable for the previous tax year.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.340]   The limitation for a SEP IRA is the contribution amount.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.620]   And there are two ways
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.980]   that you can calculate the contribution amount.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.860]   The first is, and it has to be the lower of these two.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.700]   The first is it has to be either 20%
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.580]   of your business's profit minus the deduction
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.540]   for one half of your self-employment tax.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.500]   So let's just simplify it and say 20% of your profit.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.700]   Or it's a cap of, what is it?
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.860]   2018, it's like 50, somewhere between 50 to $60,000.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.860]   I can't remember, it's like 55 or $58,000,
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.820]   something like that.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.540]   You can check that number in the IRS current amounts.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.300]   But it's whichever of those is lower.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.180]   So if your profit from your business is $100,000,
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.060]   then your total contribution is $20,000.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.660]   If you are going to,
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.980]   if you're going to use,
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.020]   if the $20,000 is enough for you,
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.940]   then it's hard to get simpler than a SEP IRA.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.940]   And that's a really good option for you.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.940]   Simple IRAs have a slightly different contribution limit.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.100]   It works on a different formula
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.740]   with has an employee and an employer amount.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.260]   But I don't know of any reason
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.900]   why you would choose a simple IRA over a SEP IRA.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.740]   Let me think for a moment.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   I can't think of any reason at the moment.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.020]   A solo 401(k) is the plan
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.980]   that will allow you to get the most into it
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.540]   because you can adjust your contribution formula
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.900]   and you're not limited to that cap of 20% of your profits.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.220]   So with a solo 401(k),
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.940]   you can adjust your contributions
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.420]   as far as your employee contributions,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.980]   employer contributions, and all that.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.220]   And you can get very close to that $55,000 number.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.700]   So if you're an aggressive saver
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.340]   and you're earning $100,000
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.060]   and you want to put $50,000 into a solo 401(k),
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.380]   that's your basic option.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.500]   I don't think you can do the solo 401(k)
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.660]   at the end of the calendar year.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.900]   Generally, that's the problem with 401(k)s.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.980]   I'm pretty sure you can't do it
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.100]   at the end of the calendar year,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.260]   although I don't know that for a fact.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.340]   But if you are an aggressive saver,
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.140]   then you would probably go in the direction
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.100]   of a solo 401(k).
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.660]   They used to be fairly rare,
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.180]   but today almost any investment broker,
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.700]   it seems like you can just download the forms
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.580]   and it's pretty simple and straightforward to set up.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.940]   They're very popular today.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.860]   - Gotcha.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.380]   All right, I think that's really all I wanted.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.940]   I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.780]   A clarification on the SEP IRA.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.700]   The way that this business is structured
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.820]   is I have a certain percentage
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   that I pay myself in a salary,
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.660]   and then the rest of it is distributed
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.020]   as an S-corp dividend.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.900]   So the limit for the SEP IRA would be 20%
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.500]   of the business's profit altogether,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   not the 20% of what I pay myself in salary, correct?
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.220]   - That is my understanding, yes.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.700]   - Okay, all right.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.300]   I'll go back and I'll do the math
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.380]   and make sure that those numbers are as different
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.220]   as I think that they will be.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.660]   But that's another good thing to take into account.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.980]   So I appreciate it.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.820]   Thank you.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.660]   - My pleasure.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.740]   The great thing about it is basically
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.540]   all of these plans are fairly flexible.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.940]   You can adjust them as you need to.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.060]   The SEP IRA is great
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.660]   because you don't have to do it year to year.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.220]   You can do it in some years and not do it in other years.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:51.220]   Check with your broker to see whoever's servicing your 401(k)
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.860]   if you choose that way,
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.900]   and just make sure it's as flexible as you need
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.820]   because what you may find in your own business,
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.780]   don't neglect investing in your own business
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.820]   so that you can invest in other people's businesses.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.300]   And this is one of my big concerns,
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.980]   especially in the early retirement community.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.220]   There's so much of a focus
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.900]   on investing in other people's businesses.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.500]   And I think there are a lot of benefits
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.860]   of investing in your own.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.380]   Remember that with regard to your tax savings,
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.940]   yes, putting money in a 401(k) is great,
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.340]   but even better than that
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.820]   is buying advertising for your own business
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.940]   or investing in a piece of equipment
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.540]   that's gonna increase your profit.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.020]   You have a 100% tax deduction
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.460]   on anything associated with your business,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.300]   according to the proper categories.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.100]   So make sure that you're not shorting your own business
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.780]   so that you can invest in other people's businesses.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.820]   I think that's unwise.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.540]   Now, if you can fully invest in your own business
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.140]   and you can maximize every profit opportunity that you have
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.420]   and also have money left over
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.300]   to invest in other people's businesses,
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.900]   go for it, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.360]   Erin in North Carolina, welcome to the show.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.780]   How can I serve you today?
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.260]   - Hi, Joshua, thank you for taking my call.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.820]   I've been a listener now for two years
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.700]   and really enjoy your content.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.220]   I've actually recently started listening
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.740]   to other Choose FI podcasts
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.620]   and other financial independence podcasts,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.540]   and I am really enjoying their content as well,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.900]   but a lot of them really push taxable buckets
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.460]   and using indexed funds for investing.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.740]   And I guess my husband and I,
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.480]   we don't have access to any taxable buckets
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.500]   with our employers.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.300]   And I guess I wanted to take a second
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.780]   to kind of share our financial independence plan with you
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.860]   and maybe to see if we're missing an opportunity
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.460]   like a Roth IRA or another way
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.180]   to possibly diversify ourselves
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.740]   in any of our investment options.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.980]   So currently last year,
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.940]   we actually paid $50,000 off of our debt
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.620]   and we are just purchased our first house pack house
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.460]   and it's set up like a duplex.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.620]   And we have three leases ready to go in August.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.100]   We live in a college town
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.300]   and we're renovating the top floor
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.580]   and students will be living up there
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.860]   and we will be renovating the bottom floor within a year
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.300]   and basically trying to enforce appreciation,
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.540]   refinance in a year,
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.100]   and then pull out some of our capital
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.820]   to be able to continue real estate investing
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.740]   and investing in other properties.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.900]   And I guess our plan is to continue that route
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.900]   of real estate investing,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.460]   maybe a property every year,
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.380]   trying to do small multifamily.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.840]   We also have access to private investors
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.900]   as my husband is working kind of as a property manager,
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.380]   but also as a construction manager
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.460]   and has worked in construction his whole life.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.900]   And he'll be taking over,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.580]   basically running student rentals for one of the owners.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.300]   And there's three other private investors
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.180]   that we could have capital
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.660]   as far as to go and invest in other properties with.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.180]   But I guess my question for you is,
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.660]   should we also try to do like a Roth IRA or,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.860]   I don't know, I just hear all these other outside voices
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.700]   and I know we're supposed to kind of use
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.540]   our skills and strengths and whatever works for us
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.180]   and every individual is different.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.780]   And I guess I just wanted to get your feedback
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.420]   on what you think about our plan
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.580]   and if we're kind of on the right track.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.780]   - Sure, what a great question.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.940]   Congratulations to you guys
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.120]   for all of your wonderful progress.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.720]   That is exciting.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.660]   What an exciting-- - Thank you, thank you.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.380]   - You are weird in a great way
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.820]   and I'm excited for you because you're doing,
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.220]   sounds like you're focused, you're clear,
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.060]   you have ideas, you have a plan.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.280]   And the things I listen for are not any specifics,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.980]   but rather a way of thinking,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.580]   a way of approach and a way of analysis.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.780]   When you are out searching for information,
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.560]   when you're out searching for inspiration,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.900]   when you're out searching for example,
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.660]   as you clearly are by listening to a show like mine,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.380]   to other excellent personal finance podcasts
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.700]   or other resources,
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.060]   you will find and develop your own plan
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.260]   that is appropriate for you.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.780]   So I'll give you a couple of comments
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.780]   and then I'll explain my approach to your situation
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.780]   and hopefully help you clarify.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.880]   So first, with regard to other podcasts,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.820]   I actually, I have a confession I'll tell you.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.260]   I don't listen to any personal finance podcasts.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.140]   And I do that intentionally
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.860]   because I'm very good at remembering what I hear
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.460]   and what I learn.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.220]   And I don't want to inadvertently steal other people's stuff
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.760]   because so if I hear someone else's idea in a podcast,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.220]   I try to give credit for the book where I read something
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.620]   or where I learned something.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.020]   And I don't, so I don't,
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.820]   I try not to listen to other personal finance podcasts
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.900]   because I don't want to steal other people's stuff.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.440]   The second reason I don't do it
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.760]   is because I don't want to inadvertently
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.820]   try to copy someone else.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.700]   I don't want to listen to someone else's show
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.580]   and say, well, that sounds great, I want to do it.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.300]   I want to create something that is uniquely mine
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.260]   and then encourage other people to create things
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.520]   that are uniquely theirs.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.740]   That said, I do know a lot of the people behind
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.500]   a lot of the other podcasts and they do a good job.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.440]   Choose FI, they're doing, I mean,
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.700]   going gangbusters right now and they're doing a great job.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.540]   And there are other,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.220]   lots of other great personal finance podcasts.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.980]   Each person that, each podcast host
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.980]   will bring a certain flair to their work.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.220]   And this is the same whether they're a podcast host
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.780]   or an author or a speaker or just your next door neighbor.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.980]   They're all going to bring a certain flair to their work
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.660]   based upon what they believe,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.820]   what they've experienced and what they do.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.540]   And so this is one of the reasons why I would,
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.940]   my guess would be that what you hear me talk about
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.260]   is different than other people.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.240]   In the, what's frequently referred to as the FIRE community,
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.540]   the Financial Independence Retire Early Podcast community,
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.220]   or not, or just online community,
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.900]   the basic path seems to be,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.680]   is usually brought down into earn a high income,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.620]   save a lot of money and then invest that money.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.780]   And the most common investment is to use mutual funds,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.860]   specifically index funds.
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.940]   And that path is awesome.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.900]   It's wonderful.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.020]   It really is good.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.300]   I have nothing bad to say about it.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.580]   It can work.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.300]   But the reason why this is so common
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.700]   is because the type of person who is in this community
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.280]   is likely to be somebody who is a high income earner
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.780]   at a corporate job.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.680]   And for a high income earner at a corporate job,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.840]   that's one of the major opportunities they have.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.460]   Somebody who's working 50 hours a week as an engineer,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.740]   a software engineer,
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.840]   and who's earning $140,000 a year,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.800]   it's unlikely that they have a lot of time
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.100]   to devote to other things.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.520]   And so they can work,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.640]   they can keep a very modest expenses,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.000]   they can earn a high income,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.880]   they can save money into mutual funds,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.000]   and it works wonderfully well.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.840]   They have access to a 401k,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.980]   and that's a very effective way for them to save $20,000
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.000]   a year, sheltered from taxes.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.160]   They often have other matches as well.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.240]   And that's a very effective plan.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.940]   I don't know of a lower stress plan
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.240]   with regard to actually being fully independent
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.320]   than that one.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   People often say, what is passive income?
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.720]   The only form of passive income that I actually know about
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.440]   is living on dividends from publicly traded companies.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.180]   That's the only form of passive income
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.480]   that I actually know about.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.160]   Real estate is not passive income.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.600]   Investing in tax lien certificates is not passive income.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.480]   Your own business is not passive income.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.600]   That is truly passive income.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.960]   Now, I actually prepared an outline
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.400]   for a whole series one time
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.760]   called "Why I'm Not Part of the FIRE Community."
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.840]   And I decided not to record it to this point.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.240]   I probably should record it,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.880]   but I'll give you a couple of points
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.840]   as to why I don't particularly,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.640]   although I've spoken to the FIRE community,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.480]   I probably am part of the FIRE community.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.800]   I like the FIRE community.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.600]   I have no problem with the FIRE community.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.320]   I don't personally identify
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.420]   as being part of the FIRE community
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.540]   because I have a few frustrations with it.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.240]   So first of all, let me give you the first thing.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.080]   I think that that's not necessarily
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.000]   the most efficient approach.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.100]   For somebody who is a high income earner,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.560]   yes, it is an efficient approach
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.840]   for them to save money into index funds.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.160]   But regardless of how much they do that,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.880]   they're going to have to work for a lot of years
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.000]   in order to save enough money
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.880]   to declare themselves financially independent.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.440]   And I think that's unnecessary.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.780]   I think the first step should be to transition
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.640]   into a career that you wouldn't want to retire from.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.960]   And if you do that, you can get there in a year.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.920]   You don't need to save 10 years.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.880]   You can get there in a year
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.560]   if you just transition into a career
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.720]   that you don't want to retire from.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.080]   So that's one of the first things.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.480]   And I feel like it's a much wiser decision,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.400]   especially for somebody who's wrestling
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.980]   with the reward of their work.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.040]   And they're saying, "I don't love this work,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.380]   but I'm just going to grip my teeth
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.760]   and do it for another eight years
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.320]   so that I'm financially independent."
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.600]   I say, "Why not just go ahead and move to something
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.560]   that you would really, really feel important about?"
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   One of these things comes down to philosophy.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.640]   I believe that work is meaningful and important
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.860]   for reasons that are outside of income.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.640]   Much of this is from my own personal religious philosophy
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.800]   and ideology.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.480]   I don't believe it's permissible
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.620]   or advisable for people to stop working.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.480]   I think you can change the nature of work,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.120]   but I don't ever want to stop working.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   I think that's fundamentally bad
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.800]   for the human soul to stop working.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.920]   And so because of that,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.200]   I have no intention of ever stopping working
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.560]   at any point in my life.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.880]   And so I see no reason.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.360]   Why should I work, work, work to save in a 401k
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.560]   and pile up a million dollars in mutual funds
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.340]   so that I can quit working and goof off?
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   I don't see that anybody actually does that.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.100]   Rather, I see that people who are in that situation,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.460]   they keep working and do something else.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.960]   So I say, "Why not just do it now?
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.920]   Why not transition?"
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.180]   The other thing that I've observed
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.080]   is due to my life experience,
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.620]   I've seen so many other people
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.620]   become financially independent
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.700]   as measured by independent of other people's constraints
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.100]   on their time through things
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.340]   that just seem a lot more efficient to me
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   than saving millions of dollars.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.440]   I look at, I have friends,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.120]   I know a guy who's a beekeeper
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.180]   and he started keep caring for bees
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.640]   and make tons of money
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.180]   just with this random side business caring for bees
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.820]   or people who do all kinds of things
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.160]   that are different than what is described.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.460]   The final point is this.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.400]   I don't talk much about that
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.420]   because I don't actually invest in,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.540]   I'm not currently invested in any publicly traded companies.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.940]   And this is a personal hangup for me
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.900]   that I don't talk a lot about publicly
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.100]   because I don't have a lot of easy solutions.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.840]   I used to sell stocks for a living.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.200]   I used to sell publicly traded companies
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.340]   and earn my income from commissions
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.620]   on the sale of those stocks or the management of assets,
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.720]   commissions and fees from the sale of stocks.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.380]   But over the last few years,
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.360]   I have become so concerned
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.280]   with the ethics and morality
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.580]   of many large modern US American companies
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.980]   that I just came to the point
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.580]   where I felt like I didn't want to earn profit
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.900]   from many of their activities.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.460]   Now, each person is going to have a different level
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.300]   of tolerance for this type of thing.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.460]   And I have never encouraged anybody
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.500]   to take the same conclusion that I have had.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.380]   But when I look at it,
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.800]   I've become very concerned about some of the,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.000]   I became concerned about some of the dividends
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.780]   that I was receiving in my stock portfolio.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.200]   And I just came to the point where I couldn't do it anymore.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.960]   And so I sold all of my stocks.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.800]   I don't currently own any publicly traded companies.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   Now, I have been working very diligently
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.520]   the last few years on developing alternatives
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.120]   for how to profit and how to invest
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.680]   without the use of publicly traded companies.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   But it's not an easy path.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.100]   And I don't know how to teach it yet
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.080]   because I'm still working at it and still figuring it out.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.320]   So that's partly what influences my own thinking.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   And I'm much more excited about investing
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.480]   in smaller businesses that are in my local community
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.120]   where I can see them, where I can impact them,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   where I can see them impact lives,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.400]   and where I can have some form of input and control
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   into the activities of that business
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.160]   so that the corporate activities
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.040]   are not things that are evil and immoral,
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.200]   but rather the corporate activities are positive,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.620]   that they're of benefit to a community
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.720]   rather than a leech on a community.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.800]   I don't know how to teach that.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.960]   And so I usually stay fairly quiet about it
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.720]   because I'm still working hard in my own life.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   And if or when I feel like I'm competent to help others,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.120]   I will do that.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.200]   But until then, I prefer to be quiet about it
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.640]   and just go about it in my own life.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.920]   So back to your situation.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.360]   That's the background to understand.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.200]   And let's go back to your situation.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.920]   In your situation, here's the analysis you have to make.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.800]   Number one, what will give me the highest rate of return
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.240]   for my activities?
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.360]   At the end of the day, you should look at your investments
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.000]   and you should calculate the rate of return.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.080]   In general, the more involved you are in an activity,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.120]   the higher the return you will get
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.840]   or the higher the return that you should get.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.120]   If you have a $10,000 investment portfolio
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.280]   and I give you two investment options,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.040]   investment option A is to put it into an investment
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.440]   that you don't have to pay any attention to.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.340]   Let's just say it's a certificate, an annuity,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.120]   a guaranteed fixed annuity,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.960]   and an insurance company offers you a 7% return
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.920]   on your money.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.480]   And they say, here's a 7% guaranteed fixed return
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   if you'll just invest your $10,000 with us.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.000]   Now, across the street,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.680]   I give you another investment opportunity.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.000]   And I say, hey, look, here's a real estate project
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.120]   that will have, it's gonna be wonderful.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.800]   We've got all these great potential options.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.000]   If you invest $10,000 from us,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.320]   and if you come over here and you work every weekend
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.920]   for the next three years on this property,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.320]   and then on Tuesday night,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.080]   you take a phone call from a tenant,
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.240]   and on Thursday morning, you meet a prospective tenant
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.280]   and take applications.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   And you do this every week for the next three years.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.600]   At the end of three years,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.560]   we guarantee you'll earn 7% on your money.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.200]   Which of those two investment options would you take?
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.000]   - Right.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.640]   The second one?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.120]   - No, but they're the same 7% both ways.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.960]   So would you take-- - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.800]   Yes.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.620]   - Exactly. - The first one.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.920]   - You take the one, the first one.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.760]   And the reason is,
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.320]   why would I put all of my blood, sweat, and tears
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.120]   into this real estate idea
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.320]   just to earn a measly 7%?
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.720]   That's absurd.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.600]   When I can just walk over and they give me an annuity
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.680]   with a guaranteed 7%.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   So what I've just clarified, hopefully clarified for you,
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.000]   is the difference between passive investing
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.480]   and active investing.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.720]   Now, usually this is done solely or discussed solely
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.420]   in the context of the stock market.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.520]   The idea between something that's a passive investment,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.200]   somebody that creates an index fund
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.080]   that just seeks to strive to maintain the index,
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.840]   versus an active investment manager
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.400]   who's going around looking for good deals.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.640]   That's what I've just determined.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.840]   And what the science behind that simply says
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.960]   that the proponents of active investing say,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.040]   "Look, we're gonna cost more money,
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.300]   "but we're gonna get a higher return
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.120]   "because we're much more involved in the market.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.440]   "We're doing the work to find good deals."
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.300]   And the passive investors say,
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.100]   "Well, you can't get a return
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.140]   "that's in excess of what it costs you to do that.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.780]   "You can just sit back and kick your feet up
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.760]   "and just take the market return."
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.320]   As an individual, you're not limited
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.520]   to just choosing between active mutual funds
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.220]   and passive mutual funds.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.020]   Your investment horizon,
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.660]   your investment opportunities are huge.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.720]   You can take your money and you can buy an index fund.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.000]   You can take your money and you can buy real estate.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.840]   You can take your money
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.160]   and you can buy old broken down vacuum cleaners
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.760]   that you find on Craigslist
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.880]   and you can fix them up and you can sell them.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.460]   You can buy farmland and lease it out.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.800]   You can buy cows and raise them.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.160]   You can buy old fixer-up beater trucks
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.200]   and paint them and sell them to collectors.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.120]   I've just not even scratched the surface
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.800]   of the things that you can do with money.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.280]   But you have to analyze that
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.600]   in terms of how much time do I have available,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.320]   what skills do I have available,
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.640]   what's the market around me, what does it offer,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.200]   and you have to go from there.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.640]   Now, I think if I were totally broke today
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.920]   and I wanted to be financially independent
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.440]   and I were starting with nothing,
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.160]   I would go into something like real estate
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.360]   long before I would ever buy an index fund
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.640]   because of the fact that one,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.680]   I can leverage financing other people's money.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.440]   I don't necessarily have to borrow the money.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.800]   I could just leverage other people's money.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.260]   I could be a bird dog and I could have signed contracts.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.480]   I could figure out how to leverage other people's money
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.520]   in building up in partnerships arrangements.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.000]   And so I could use other people's million dollars
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.400]   to control a $2 million portfolio.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.360]   I can maintain full control of my time,
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.160]   full control of my investment activities,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.800]   and I can use the power of leverage
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.500]   to build more wealth quickly than I could with index funds.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.160]   But that would assume that I didn't have a satisfying job.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.760]   So if you already had a satisfying job,
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.240]   then just work the job and buy index funds.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.760]   That's my method of analysis,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   is you have to say what gives me the highest rate of return
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.200]   with an appropriate lifestyle
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.360]   based upon what we want to do.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.240]   In your situation,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   it sounds like that's probably real estate.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.640]   But in many other situations,
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.440]   especially somebody who is working a corporate job
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.680]   or who is a professional,
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.880]   and those opportunities, they're not interested in them,
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.760]   they don't have the time,
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.720]   they don't want to learn about them.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.600]   For them, an index fund and a 401(k)
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.040]   is a beautiful solution and it works very well.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.640]   - Yes, it does.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.280]   - So what do you think is the best for you and your husband?
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.120]   Real estate or buying mutual funds?
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   - Definitely real estate, just because of our time.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.600]   Because like I said, he recently changed jobs,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.200]   and right now it's very busy
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   and they're working on projects.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.280]   But in six months in the winter,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.560]   I mean, the owner told him,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.480]   who he's gonna be taking over his position,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.120]   said, "You will feel like you're retired
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.280]   "because you will have maybe 15 or 20 hours of work a week."
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.640]   And basically he's giving him the opportunity
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.800]   to go and work on his own projects.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.600]   So I definitely feel like real estate is our avenue
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.880]   and what we should continue to pursue.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   And I guess I was just wanting to have the affirmation
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.240]   that we were doing the right thing
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.840]   'cause you hear all these voices around you,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.680]   but you definitely have confirmed that.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.720]   - Good, good.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.240]   So the key is to understand why
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.880]   that's the right thing for you.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.000]   And to understand also why you could listen
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.880]   to another podcast or talk to a friend
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.560]   and that's not the right thing for them.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.040]   And when you're clear on that
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.600]   and you're comfortable with that,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.480]   then you have the opportunity
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.560]   to just rest in your decisions and you feel good about that.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   So I don't feel the need to try to get other people
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.520]   not to invest in stocks.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.880]   Not my business, but I'm not gonna invest in stocks
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.560]   for my own personal reasons.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.960]   And I can explain to you why stocks are great.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.120]   I can teach you all the theory.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   I used to sell stocks for a living.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.200]   And so the same thing with real estate.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.560]   Real estate may be wonderful,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.640]   but recognize that that also could change.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.120]   I've known a number of people
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.560]   who have gotten into real estate
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.240]   thinking that that was their surefire ticket to wealth.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.800]   And then over time, they realized
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.400]   that that wasn't actually the best move for them.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.280]   And then they moved on.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.720]   And so the key is self-awareness
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.160]   and understanding why you're doing what you're doing.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.160]   And then you'll work out the right plan through.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.200]   But you guys are on the right track and it sounds awesome.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.360]   And I'll say this,
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.280]   I love the lifestyle of real estate
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.520]   and privately owned business
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.480]   because you don't have to be, to use a pejorative term,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.640]   you don't have to be a corporate drone for 15 years
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.560]   just so that you can escape your soul-sucking job.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.880]   You can, in real estate and in private business,
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.220]   you can choose any day what you wanna do.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.000]   Now you have a lot of responsibility
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.540]   that that other person may not have on the weekend,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.680]   but you have also a lot of freedom and flexibility.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.800]   And so I like, my bent is always towards private business,
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.360]   towards private investment, and towards private,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.540]   well, private business and investment activities,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.600]   because that allows me today
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.000]   to live a lifestyle of freedom and liberty
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.280]   that I didn't have when I was a corporate employee.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.840]   So great job, Erin, keep up the great work.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.800]   - Thank you so much.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.320]   - Let's help those other podcast hosts.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.480]   As you've listened around,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.120]   what have become your favorite personal finance podcast?
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.280]   Who's doing a great job right now
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.320]   that you want other people to be aware of?
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.720]   - Absolutely, well, I mean, I listen to your podcast
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.960]   on a regular basis, and then I listen to Choose Fi,
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.240]   and I think that their stuff is amazing.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   And then the other podcast that I listen to
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.080]   is Bigger Pockets.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.400]   Those are the three that I stick to on a regular basis.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.160]   - And both of those are, Choose Fi
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.060]   and Bigger Pockets are awesome.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.840]   They do a great job.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.340]   I know all of them, casual friends with all of them.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.360]   They do a great job, and I wanna see them build up.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.160]   And I want to encourage tons and tons of people
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.640]   to build more podcasts, more things.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.680]   I wanna do that, because it all helps.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.600]   And there are people who click with what I do,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.840]   and there are people who don't click with what I do.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.360]   And there should be a huge diversity
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.280]   of voices and ideas and opinions.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.720]   So if you're looking for good podcasts,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.600]   I check out both of those that Aaron just recommended,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.560]   and see if those will also help you with good ideas,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.600]   either to challenge you or to help you.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   Finally, we go to Ed in Virginia.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.240]   Ed, welcome to the show.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.740]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.920]   - Josh, what a long-time listener.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.320]   Really enjoy your podcast.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.680]   I'm calling the situation my son is in.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.960]   He's worked for a regional real estate sales company,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.120]   and he recently took another job
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.300]   and negotiated a departure date.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.400]   And then about a week later,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.000]   the company changed his departure date
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.840]   to two weeks to the left,
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.240]   which significantly affected his pending commissions.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.480]   We just wanted your thoughts on approaches
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.120]   of what he could do and how he could approach the company
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.920]   to discuss that.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.880]   - So let me clarify the facts of the case.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.240]   So he's moving, but because the new company
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.000]   that he's moving to wants him to start two weeks earlier,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.800]   that's impacting the closing out of his current deals?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:52.680]   - No, what happened was he gave his two weeks notice,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.340]   and the company said,
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.540]   "Great, we'll give you two weeks of vacation at the end,
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.720]   "and we'll accept your two weeks."
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.880]   And then about a week later,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.640]   they sent him an email that said,
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.200]   "Well, you're not getting to leave
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.520]   "on the day we negotiated.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.960]   "We moved it back to the day you told us."
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.800]   - Got it.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.400]   - And that affects the commissions
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.280]   by roughly $3,000, I believe.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.340]   - That's frustrating.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.480]   To the best of your knowledge or to your son's knowledge,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.760]   has he acted in good faith?
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.920]   Has he upheld his duty?
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.440]   Has he been a useful and reliable employee?
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.560]   And this just seems like bad faith on their part?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.840]   - Yes, and he kind of, I would offer up
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.360]   that he attributes it primarily to his direct manager
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.240]   more than the company in general.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   And he's approached his direct manager,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.760]   supervisor in the HR department.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.720]   And he's sorting through that.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.560]   And he wanted your thoughts on what he might do
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.160]   because he's also a listener.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   - Okay, well, so here's my philosophy.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.320]   I don't know if this is, this is just a philosophy,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.400]   just an operating framework on things.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.680]   So number one, I think the best course of action
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.300]   is always to approach any situation,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.640]   including any negotiation or contentious point
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.480]   of disagreement with as much honesty,
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.660]   with as much openness and with as much clarity as possible.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.700]   And you can't change another person,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.920]   but you can change yourself.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.520]   And so looking honestly to say, have I done a good job?
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.200]   Did I do something wrong?
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.840]   Now, assuming that's the case is no,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.000]   then going and saying, well, how can we work this out?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.960]   And I think in general, people respond to somebody
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.360]   who's willing to go and have an in-person discussion
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.980]   and to talk and say, listen, this is unfair.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.240]   So if he has been treating,
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.560]   if he is being treated unfairly, for example,
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.100]   if the commissions that they're saying he's not gonna get,
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.800]   if he did the work and those deals were closing
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.680]   and he were entitled to that because he did the work,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.560]   then that's unfair for them to withhold those commissions
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.160]   just because they're working through the payout cycle.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.400]   Now, if his leaving is causing a problem
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.640]   that now someone else has to finish the work,
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.720]   and so that's why they're saying
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.120]   you have a less of a commission, a lower commission amount,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.160]   then he's gotta assess that.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.880]   But assume that everything is on his side.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.780]   Well, in that case, I would go to an in-person
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.880]   and I would just appeal first to whoever it is
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.800]   that I have the most interaction with.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.760]   Appeal to them first and say, please, I did this work.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.040]   These were my deals.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.160]   I gave you a two-week notice.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.240]   I should have been paid out for that two-week notice.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.280]   These were my commissions.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.820]   I'm entitled to these and make an honest, heartfelt appeal.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.240]   It also would probably be appropriate to do it in writing.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.440]   It's important to do things like this in writing
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.960]   or to take good notes on them
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.360]   in case you ever end up in a legal case
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.200]   or a lawsuit of some kind
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.660]   so that you have the data to present as evidence.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.160]   So if you can make an in-person appeal
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.580]   and also deliver a written letter,
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.880]   I think that's a useful way to approach it.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.280]   If you're denied by the person who's a direct superior,
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.840]   then going up, I don't see any reason not to go up a level
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.160]   or go to another person and say,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   listen, I'm being treated unfairly here.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.800]   I'm entitled to these commissions.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.280]   Would you please pay me these commissions?
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.640]   Here's why I think I'm entitled to them and make your case.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.840]   In general, I think people are pretty fair
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.280]   and they wanna be treated fairly.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.240]   And if they don't treat you fairly,
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.180]   then they should know that they're opening themselves up
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.820]   to a much bigger cost.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.540]   You start shorting people on commissions they're due
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.060]   and you open yourself up to a much bigger cost
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.960]   than just the $3,000 of the bad reputation that you get,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.220]   the ability for your son to open a website.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.660]   He can put up a free website
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.580]   and explain his story of the situation.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.100]   And that bad publicity would haunt that company much more
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.420]   than just paying them the $3,000.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.080]   So I would go and make a series of appeals.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.340]   And then if they won't listen to him,
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.620]   I would try to think,
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.060]   is there someone else that I could appeal to, a friend?
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.940]   I don't personally think there's any point
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.700]   in threatening legal action.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.040]   In some business disputes, that's obviously appropriate,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.540]   but I prefer to approach it in a good faith manner
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.900]   and go from there.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.500]   Now, he should of course consider
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.700]   if he has grounds for a potential lawsuit,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.020]   whether that's of whatever basis.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.540]   I would guess that for 3,000 bucks,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.940]   I mean, it's hard for me to imagine that being worth it.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:55.100]   I would probably, if I've made a number of appeals
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.580]   and if I've really asked them
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.980]   and the answer is just simply that these people are,
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.180]   if they're crooks, I would probably just choose
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:09.180]   to walk away from the money and let it go
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.580]   and never do business with them
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.260]   or anyone associated with them ever again.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.760]   Because when people will show their hand like that,
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.380]   then you know that there's no point in doing business.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.780]   But it's just hard for me to imagine
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.340]   that 3,000 bucks is worth legal action,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.980]   it's worth the hassle, probably easier for them
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.260]   just to move on, him just to move on to the next company
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.380]   and earn the money out in no time.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.740]   But I don't know that I have anything
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.100]   more intelligent than that.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.620]   - So that's essentially consistent
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.220]   with what we've talked about.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.260]   And the one final question I'd ask is,
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.620]   if it gets to the point where they're not willing
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.580]   to talk to you, is that something that's worth
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.620]   an afternoon in small claims court without a lawyer?
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.460]   - Probably so.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.740]   - Is that something that you--
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.580]   - I think so.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.580]   For this type of thing, if you can do it,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.540]   yeah, I think so.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.940]   For $3,000, if you've got the evidence
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.500]   and you've got things together,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.180]   then that probably is worth an afternoon
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.100]   in small claims court.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.220]   Just to say, here's the facts of the case,
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.100]   here's what happened, I'm entitled to these commissions.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.180]   He's gonna need a paper trail,
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.540]   he's gonna need to prepare his presentation,
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.620]   but I think there is.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.060]   I struggle with that, knowing how to answer that,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.580]   because on the one hand, it often just feels easier
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.060]   just to walk away.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.780]   But on the other hand, if you do that,
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.780]   sometimes you're letting somebody who is immoral
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.180]   or a crook continue on without establishing
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.860]   a paper trail of a lawsuit.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.220]   And I recently had interaction with somebody
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.140]   and it was a landlord-tenant dispute.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.820]   The tenant acted in good faith
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.700]   and the landlord absolutely did not act in good faith.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:52.980]   And the facts, in my opinion, the facts were clear.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.740]   And I gave the advice in that situation,
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.380]   I said, "I think you have a duty and an obligation."
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.780]   In that situation, the person had the bandwidth.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.620]   I said, "You have a duty and an obligation
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.020]   "to take this to court so that you can,
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.140]   "at the very least, establish a reputation
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.220]   "against this landlord, 'cause this landlord is a crook.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.340]   "And we have a duty to stand up against and oppose those
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.220]   "who are committing injustice."
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:24.740]   And oftentimes, if more of us would be faithful
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.340]   to seek to expose those who are doing evil,
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.060]   who are committing injustice,
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.780]   when that evil and that injustice is small,
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:37.140]   then I think many times we could possibly minimize
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.180]   their ability to commit larger injustice
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.100]   and larger evil at a later date.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.060]   Now, that's a very big kind of consideration,
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.340]   but I think we do have the responsibility
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.500]   sometimes to do that.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.620]   And so an afternoon of small claims court,
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.340]   yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.300]   And at the very least, there's gonna be facts of the case
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:01.300]   that'll be there and he'll feel like he's done his best.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.940]   - That's a great answer and I really--
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.660]   - Go ahead. - And I really appreciate it.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.660]   - Absolutely. - It's a great answer
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.980]   and I really appreciate it.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.580]   - Good. - So final thing is
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.420]   you're one of my top podcasts that I listen to.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.220]   And the episodes that I enjoyed the most
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.660]   were the one about how to avoid being arrested.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.740]   - Oh, great. - And I've actually
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.340]   put into practice some of those things, not all of them.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.140]   - Good, good.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.260]   Well, I appreciate that.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.340]   It's always funny because whenever I do shows like that,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.180]   there's a mixture.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.540]   I get good people like you who say, "Wow, I enjoyed that."
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.020]   And it's the kind of thing that doesn't,
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.180]   a lot of people would never expect
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.540]   in a personal finance podcast.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.900]   But I also have, I always get a rash of angry people
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.340]   who say, "I can't believe you, blah, blah, blah."
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:49.900]   And I've learned that there are a lot of people like you
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.820]   who do enjoy it.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.740]   And these are the things that I think make a big difference.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.860]   And as I said in that episode,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.780]   those issues are very important to me
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.300]   because they're the kind of thing
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.380]   that you don't get advice from
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.220]   from a money magazine type of scenario.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.980]   But yet if you've ever worked with somebody,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.380]   I've worked with a couple of people
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.740]   over the last couple of years
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:16.300]   who have just, who have been on that electronic plantation.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.140]   And it's so heart-wrenching when you see somebody
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.660]   who they made mistakes
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.660]   and they have sought to atone for those mistakes.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.900]   And yet they're still on the electronic plantation
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.820]   and they get buried so deep.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.580]   And it puts such impediment in them
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.100]   when they have sought to make decisions that are right now
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.460]   and they've sought to put things together,
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.060]   but they're buried so deep.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.300]   I can see the temptation for them to just say,
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.460]   "You know what, I'm done.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.020]   I'm going back to the life of crime
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.820]   that at least it was simpler
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.780]   and at least it was easier than this road."
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.860]   And I think we have a duty to work with those people
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:58.340]   and to help them because I understand why the recidivism,
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.260]   I understand a little bit why the recidivism rate is so high
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.900]   and I think we really fail people
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.500]   when we don't stand with them.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   None of us pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.500]   We all need help,
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.460]   but it's our responsibility to help those
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.060]   who are being diligent to fix things that they can.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.420]   So I'm glad that that show helped you
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.140]   and my only request for you and every listener
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.100]   is take that and teach it to other people.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.940]   'Cause the number of people that I can reach
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.140]   in a podcast like this is very small,
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.340]   but you can pass those ideas along little by little
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.380]   and that will have a huge magnifying effect.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.580]   So thank you for the nice words, I appreciate that.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.580]   - You're welcome.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.020]   Sorry about the airplane noise,
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.340]   I'm on the flight path to Dallas.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.260]   - And I am sitting on a busy street corner
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.980]   in front of a laundromat
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.740]   while my family waits in the trailer
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.900]   while I figure out how to run my business
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.380]   and run these Q&A shows from the road.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.820]   And I'm stalling here because the sunshine
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.580]   has gotten so intense that I can no longer
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.820]   see my computer screen to start my closing music,
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.260]   which, there we go.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.900]   Welcome to the joy of learning how to record
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.140]   and publish a podcast while traveling.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:09.220]   We've been traveling in a very remote part
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.100]   of the Rocky Mountains and I came down to the city
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.020]   to find a data connection so that I could record
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.900]   today's show.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.100]   Thank you to all of you who called in
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.220]   for today's podcast Q&A.
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.500]   If you would like to join us on next week's show,
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.780]   please do so at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.900]   Become a patron of the show there
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.220]   and you'll gain access to the Q&A calls.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.300]   I should be able to do another show this next week.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.820]   It's a very high priority for me.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.460]   I love doing them and I thank you for listening.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.020]   Thank you for being along on this adventure.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.740]   It is so fun for me to be able to speak with you,
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.660]   share these ideas.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.820]   I hope you'll take them.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.420]   And as I so frequently play that little blurb
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.260]   at the end of the show,
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.660]   I hope that you'll take these ideas,
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.540]   put them into practice in your own life
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.300]   and teach them to others.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.900]   Because there are a lot of people who are very weak
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.900]   and only the strong really can help the weak.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.140]   And so my hope is to help you to be in a stronger position
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.660]   in your personal finances,
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.580]   stronger position in your own life,
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.700]   so that you can then move from that place of strength
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.220]   and reach out a helping hand to others
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.820]   who are in a weak place.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:14.780]   Take the time and free up your time
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.420]   so that you can be involved,
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   not only in your own situations,
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.540]   but you can be involved in other people's situations
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.540]   in whatever way is available to you.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.180]   There's really no limit to the number of opportunities
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.540]   that are available to you.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   But I encourage you, if you do so,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.940]   you'll find opportunities for charity
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.580]   and opportunities for you to really impact other's lives
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.020]   at a very granular level.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:40.100]   It's much more effective for you to take some time
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.780]   and bail your friend out of jail
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.860]   and go and work with them
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.940]   and help them to pay their court costs
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.540]   and help them to get off the electronic plantation.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.300]   That's probably gonna be a more meaningful
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.180]   and satisfying thing than for you to write another check
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.100]   to the big anti-this campaign
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.620]   just because they need more money.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.220]   I encourage you, get involved at the levels
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.180]   that you can do so.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.500]   This is of course just building on that last caller.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.300]   But one of the benefits of wealth,
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.940]   of stability and strength
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.220]   is your opportunity to reach out and serve others.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.500]   So this weekend, look for an opportunity to reach out
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.380]   and to serve others.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.180]   And I'll be back with you next week.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.700]   Thank you for listening.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.100]   You've honored me with your time and attention
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.180]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.660]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.180]   with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.020]   and techniques and tools
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.580]   that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.500]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.500]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.540]   in today's show, make a plan to take action on it.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.620]   Listening does lead to learning,
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.220]   but learning in and of itself
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.540]   doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.580]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.300]   So take action.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.340]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.700]   and share it with somebody that you care about.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.540]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.820]   in helping me to propagate the message
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.260]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.460]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.500]   And it also helps you because teaching others
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.440]   is one of the most effective ways for you to learn
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.160]   and for you to cement your learning.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.980]   Three, if there's an idea
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.860]   that's been specifically helpful to you
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.680]   and if you're gaining financial benefit
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.460]   from Radical Personal Finance,
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.700]   I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.460]   for this work voluntarily.

[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.380]   That's my Patreon page.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.260]   You can support me with a dollar a month,
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.260]   $5 a month, $10 a month,
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.060]   any number that seems right to you.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.500]   But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.460]   and if it's achieving financial results in your life,
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.020]   I'd be grateful for your financial support
