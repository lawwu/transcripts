[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Happy Friday everyone and welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.880]   pastor and author John Piper.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   Well we finished the week with a question from a listener named Nancy and it's this,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.640]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.000]   Here's my question for you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.280]   Can an unbeliever please God and if not, what are we to make of the account of Cornelius
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.160]   in Acts chapter 10?
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.560]   Can you explain this to me and thank you in advance."
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.720]   Let me begin with a couple of passages of scripture that draw out our answer to Nancy's
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.560]   question about whether unbelievers can please God and then on the basis of that we'll tackle
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   Cornelius.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.880]   This is Hebrews 11, 6, "Without faith it is impossible to please God.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.320]   For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   seek him."
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.600]   And then Romans 14, 23, "Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.580]   So I infer from those two passages, we could add others, that there is a sense in which
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.320]   everything that comes out of an unbelieving heart displeases the Lord.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.080]   Or to say it differently, nothing that comes out of the heart of unbelief pleases the Lord.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   Of course, this doesn't mean that unbelievers can't perform acts which outwardly conform
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.220]   to God's law.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.460]   They don't kill, they don't steal, they don't lie.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.920]   In other words, they conform outwardly to some of God's revealed will.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   But what this shows is that it's not simply external conformity to prescribe deeds that
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.440]   pleases the Lord, right?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   We parents know that.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.000]   We don't want external compliance from our kids while their hearts are far from us.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.220]   What pleases the Lord is a heart of trust and love.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.920]   What comes out of that heart pleases the Lord.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:25.240]   So in that sense, even the so-called "right things" that an unbeliever does are not pleasing
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.660]   to the Lord, because they are not deeds of faith.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.180]   Faith towards God, love for Jesus.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.300]   Now this raises the question of how God looks upon the steps that a person takes toward
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.900]   Christ before they believe on Christ.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.320]   That's getting toward Cornelius, but we're not there yet.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:56.560]   The answer, I think, is that each of those steps is a gift of free, unmerited grace as
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   God moves a person toward the gospel, toward salvation, toward faith, and as God looks
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.560]   upon the person himself, he sees him as unworthy of that gift of grace.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.400]   That's why we call it grace.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.640]   Grace is undeserved, done for a person who is not in himself pleasing the Lord, which
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.920]   is what we all feel when we finally get saved, when we finally believe, don't we?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.320]   We say, "Grace brought me here."
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.920]   God looks upon his own work as a good and right and pleasing thing that he's doing
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.160]   to get somebody to faith.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.920]   It's good that a person be drawn to Christ.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.480]   Now, what about Cornelius?
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.800]   It's not only chapter 10, but chapter 11 is all-important as it retells the story again.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.640]   Cornelius gets a lot of attention in the book of Acts.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.240]   It's really, really amazing, and there are reasons for that.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.320]   Let's refresh our memory about Cornelius.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.040]   He was a Gentile centurion, that is, a non-Jewish Roman military official, and he's described
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.800]   in chapter 10, verse 2 of Acts, as a man who "feared God and gave alms generously and
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   prayed continually to God."
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   And an angel shows up in a vision and tells him that his prayers have ascended to God
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.920]   and that he should now send for the apostle Peter.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.280]   In other words, the angel doesn't show up and say, "You're a very good man.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.000]   You pray a lot, and you do good deeds, and that's that.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Way to go.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   You'll go to heaven."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.760]   He doesn't say that at all.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880]   He says, "Your prayers have been heard, and what the answer to the prayer consists
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.080]   in is go get a gospel messenger.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.800]   You got some news you need to know in order to be saved," which is exactly what Luke's
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   going to say in just a minute.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.720]   So we see that God is at work in his free grace to bring Cornelius to the point where
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   he can hear the gospel and be saved.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.400]   Meanwhile, Peter, in Joppa, is receiving a similar kind of vision to get him ready to
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.040]   do something as a Jew would be very hard to do, namely go hang out in the house of a Gentile.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.880]   And he gets this vision of all these unclean animals, and God says, "Don't call anything
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.800]   unclean that I call clean."
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.960]   And part of that vision, he's told that he should be ready to associate with Gentiles,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:46.720]   these unclean Gentiles, without fretting or worrying because they are just as "acceptable"—that's
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   the word—they're just as acceptable into God's family as any Jewish unbeliever would
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.160]   be if they believed in Jesus.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   So in Acts 11-12, Peter says that the Spirit made it plain that we should "make no distinction"
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.800]   between these unclean Gentiles and these unbelieving Jews.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.920]   They're both equally valid candidates for faith in Jesus.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.040]   So according to Acts 11-14, what the angel said to Cornelius was that Peter would "declare
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.800]   to you a message by which you will be saved."
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.400]   That's why I said chapter 11 is so important.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.320]   Let me say it again.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:38.080]   11-14, the angel says to Cornelius, "Peter will declare to you a message by which you
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.360]   will be saved."
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.440]   So in all his praying and almsgiving and fearing God, he's not saved.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.300]   Anybody who uses the story of Cornelius to say there are a lot of saved people out among
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.400]   the nations that don't need to hear the gospel are turning the story exactly upside down.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.280]   The whole point of the story is, yes, there are people out there who need the gospel,
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.960]   and God intends to save because he's not prejudiced against any ethnicity.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.600]   "Declare to you a message by which you will be saved."
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.280]   So then, go to the Gentiles, and God has granted repentance to life.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.720]   That's what the Christians infer.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.400]   When the Christians watch Cornelius and his family believe, they say, "Whoa!"
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:29.700]   Then to the Gentiles also, God has granted repentance that leads to life.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.520]   So the point of the story of Cornelius is that there are Gentiles scattered through
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   the world who are "acceptable to God" in the sense of being able to be saved just as much
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.840]   as anybody else, no matter what their ethnic condition is.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.040]   But there are many people throughout the world whom God, in his amazing grace, is not only
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.200]   finding acceptable, but is granting that they pray and that they have visions and they be
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.080]   drawn into contact with the gospel so that they can be saved.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   So we should not look upon those prayers or those deeds as good in and of themselves—that's
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.720]   her original question—but as wonderful acts of God's grace leading a person toward repentance,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.320]   toward faith in the hearing of the gospel.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.680]   So bottom line, conclusion to Nancy's question, without faith, it is impossible to please
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   God.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:46.280]   But God, in his mercy, draws unbelieving sinners to himself and in the process grants them
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:54.560]   desires and actions that lead to an encounter with the gospel so that they may believe and
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.840]   then lead a life of faith-pleasing to the Lord.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.360]   Yeah, that's a very helpful distinction to make.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.320]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Nancy, and to all the listeners

[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.480]   and part of your weekly routines.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   We really appreciate it.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   The question you may have of your own, do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.960]   So today's question was whether or not non-Christians can honor God, and then that raises a related
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.840]   question which is, does God love the non-elect?
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.480]   If not, why not?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.520]   And if so, how is his love to the non-elect displayed to them?
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.320]   This is a very common question that we get in the inbox.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.100]   It's a question faced by all Reformed teachers throughout the centuries, really, and it is
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.720]   scheduled on Monday when we return on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:54.740]   We'll see you then.
