[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Can you give us just a brief top contour of what the slow-carb diet is?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560]   Sure.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.760]   The slow-carb diet is intended to be a simple, easy-to-adhere-to diet for people who have
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.960]   perhaps failed other diets that allows you to recompose your body.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.640]   So improve muscle mass, decrease body fat percentage.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   And the rules are really simple.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.880]   And that's part of what makes it work.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.120]   It's not ideal for every sport and every circumstance, but broadly speaking, it works for a lot of
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.200]   people who've had trouble with dieting in the past.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.760]   So rule number one, don't drink calories.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760]   That's it.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760]   Very simple.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.200]   So black coffee, unsweetened tea, great.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.880]   Juice, out.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   Anything with calories, out.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.640]   You could add a little bit of heavy cream to your coffee, let's say.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.040]   But that's also bending the rules in a way that I don't like.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.720]   So in the beginning, it's like follow the rules so you can break them later.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.840]   So in the beginning, let's just say, you can't drink calories.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.600]   Number two, don't eat anything white.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600]   Sounds pretty basic, right?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.820]   Just don't eat anything that is the color of white or that could be white.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.960]   Basically that means you're going to be avoiding starches and things that are similar to starches.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.720]   That includes things like oatmeal.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.080]   That includes things like oatmeal.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.560]   So roughly speaking, just avoiding things that are white or that could be white will
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.160]   get you pretty far.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   And yes, there are exceptions.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   Like cauliflower, fine.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.600]   You can have cauliflower.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.540]   But again, don't get fancy, right?
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.160]   It's very easy to outsmart yourself when it comes to behavioral change.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.560]   Keep it simple.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.240]   So for at least two weeks, forget about the exceptions, right?
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   Don't drink calories.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840]   Don't eat anything white.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.600]   And then eat 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   Okay, we got that.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.120]   And then there are a few buckets you can choose from, right?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.280]   So you have vegetables, beans, and lentils, and then some type of protein.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.040]   So you're going to come up with meals that you can follow without deviating for a period
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   of one or two weeks.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.800]   Just come up with the same meals.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   And that's going to sound boring, yes.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   But guess what?
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   You do it already.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.160]   You just might not realize it.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.520]   And the lentils and the beans specifically as a prereq, we can get into some of the reasons,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.640]   but add a lot of fiber and also inhibit appetite, right?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.920]   So that's actually a very important component of these meals.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.520]   And there may be a handful of other rules, but those are the basics.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.280]   And then the redemption is take one day off per week and just go fucking crazy.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   That's cheat day.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.480]   There are some epic cheat days out there.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.680]   Some I've captured for myself.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   And anything goes.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.880]   When I say anything, I do mean anything.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   So if you want to consume multiple pizzas, pints of ice cream, whatever, indulge.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   I left one out.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.180]   No fruit during the week.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.320]   So avoid fruit, avoid fructose, so agave nectar, anything that is sort of hidden sugar, avoid
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   all that.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.800]   So no added sweeteners, obviously, but avoid fruit and fructose.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.160]   And again, it's not going to kill you.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   Guess what, if you're from European ancestry, your ancestors did not have like blueberries
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.760]   in the middle of winter, generally speaking, right?
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.080]   So you'll be fine for a few weeks.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.320]   And then there's that cheat day.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.840]   And cheat day, anything goes.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.360]   The amount of damage you can do on cheat day is pretty limited.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.000]   And there are ways you can mitigate that.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.040]   There's a whole chapter called damage control and before our body.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.920]   But focusing just on that diet and having one day off where you know you can do anything
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.680]   means when you are controlling yourself for those six days of the week, you're not giving
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.380]   up your favorite foods forever.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.480]   You can even keep a list of all the things you want to eat on cheat day.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.320]   And then you have free license to eat on cheat day.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.240]   And that provides you with a release valve so that you can build in the cheating as opposed
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   to having it occur as a failure point.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.840]   And there are a handful of other things there.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.360]   If you have domino foods in the house, for instance, if you eat a lot of almonds or mixed
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   nuts and you're just going to sit there compulsively eating them while you're sitting at your laptop,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   don't have what I call dominoed foods in the house, which are going to really create some
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.760]   portion control issues.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   But broadly speaking, don't drink calories, don't eat things that are white, take from
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.480]   three categories and build your meals out and those are the meals that you follow.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   Do not eat fruit or fructose and then cheat one day a week.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.120]   Saturday is a nice day for cheat day for most folks.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080]   And just to answer some questions people are going to have, no, that doesn't mean 24 hours
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   that you can spread out over two days.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.640]   That will actually set you back.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.080]   But the amount of fat that you can store in a handful of sittings over 24 hours, which
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.000]   legitimately is more like 12 to 18 hours, pretty limited.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.760]   So that's a slow carb diet.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Great.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Thank you for that.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.920]   I also want to ask, is it okay to take the day after cheat day and fast or do one meal
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   that day?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.560]   When I followed the slow carb diet, I benefited from it tremendously.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.320]   Lost fat, gained muscle, tons of energy, sleeping great, required less caffeine, all sorts of
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   wonderful things.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   Stable blood sugar.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.840]   I felt so, so good.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.040]   Really enjoyed the cheat days.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.160]   I really, really enjoyed the cheat days.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.200]   So much fun.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.360]   At some point, there's some gastric distress that comes from not regulating intake, which
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.720]   led me to not want to eat the next day.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.880]   So I tended to do the cheat days on Sunday in my case.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.200]   And then I would fast most of Monday, just water, black coffee, tea.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.520]   And then I might have a small meal in the evening.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.160]   And then by Tuesday, I was back on the slow carb diet.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   Does that seem like a detrimental deviation from the plan?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.700]   I think that if that is what works for you, then that is what works for you.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.000]   So the slow carb diet template for me is a starting point.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   And generally, I'll say, I think this is from Picasso, right, it's like learn the rules
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.480]   as an amateur so you can break them as a professional.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's like I recommend most people kind of stick with the format for a handful of weeks
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.440]   and measure the results, right?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.600]   So there are guidelines for how to measure.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.000]   The scale is a bit of a blunt instrument, so there are other ways.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.480]   But if you're extremely overweight, you can just use the scale.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.520]   And fasting, I think, is fine, or just ratcheting back your caloric consumption significantly.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.160]   And what happens over time for most people also is for the first, say, four weeks on
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.520]   cheat day, you're going to go completely insane.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.680]   And I remember I was doing something much stricter called the cyclical ketogenic diet,
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.220]   which is a whole separate thing.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.940]   It's much more limiting in terms of what you can eat.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.360]   But I was training for ultimately the nationals in Chinese kickboxing.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.920]   This was happening in '99.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.120]   So I was training super hard.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.640]   I was following a cyclical ketogenic diet, which meant I could eat very few things.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.760]   But I did have this one cheat day.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.440]   And I would do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand, which is one of the things you
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.920]   can do to limit the damage on cheat day, do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.840]   And then I would just go crazy.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.040]   I mean, I would drive to Krispy Kreme, buy 12 donuts, and they would be gone by the time
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   I got home.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   And it wasn't an hour away.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.680]   It was like a 10-minute drive.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   Donuts would be gone, right?
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   So I would go to Safeway, and I would buy a bag of those fun-sized Snickers.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.920]   And that would be just a tiny portion of my calories.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.200]   Sweet stuff for you, huh?
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.460]   A lot of sweet stuff.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.880]   I also did the savory stuff.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.360]   I mean, I had my favorites.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   Nothing was safe.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   Pizza.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   Nothing was safe.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   Nothing was safe.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.720]   My paws got into everything.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.640]   And then over time, because the next day you're going to feel like you got hit by a diabetic
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.920]   dump truck, you start ratcheting back.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   And you're like, OK, maybe I don't need to do that.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.560]   Maybe cheat day will just be two meals.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.520]   Or maybe cheat day will just be like the pastries in the morning with the coffee.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.920]   And you start to regulate a bit, generally.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.880]   You don't have to, but over time, you generally will.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.200]   And I think after you've followed it to the T, just follow the commandments for, say,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.080]   four to eight weeks, then you can certainly deviate.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.480]   And I'm not saying if you're not hungry, don't eat.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:43.520]   However, in many cases, people have acclimated to not eating in the morning.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.360]   And then they end up overeating later in the day.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.920]   If you have that habit, if you're consuming 50% of your calories or more at dinner, and
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   you want to lose body fat, I would say get some cottage cheese or something that will
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.280]   give you 30 grams easily in the morning.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.480]   Worst case scenario, use a protein of some type.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   Just don't make it hypercaloric.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   You mean powdered protein?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.000]   It could be powdered whey protein.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.480]   Whole food is going to do a lot more.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   And no calorie counting, correct?
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   No calorie counting.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.360]   It tends to be self-limiting.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.640]   When you're eating this much fiber and this much protein, it tends to be very self-limiting,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   what you'll want to consume and what you can consume.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.760]   Once again, I had great experiences with slow carb diet, and I'm going to go back on.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.840]   Yeah, and nobody needs to buy anything to figure it out.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.520]   If you just search on Tim.blog slow carb diet, you'll get everything that you need to get
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   started.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.240]   No purchase necessary.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
