[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:43.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.760]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.380]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.040]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.600]   This episode, as with all episodes,

[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.600]   Today, I'm very pleased to have Jerry O'Reilly and Rich Powers
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.380]   from Vanguard.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.960]   When you listen to this podcast, you
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.960]   will be amazed at the candor these two people provide
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.560]   to us about behind-the-scenes operations of how the largest
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.880]   index fund in the world, the $1.3 trillion Vanguard Total
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.600]   Stock Market Index Fund, operates and is managed.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200]   We're covering a lot of ground today.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.800]   We're going to be talking about daily operations
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.280]   and how money flows in and out of the fund,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600]   how securities flow in and out of the fund in kind
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.480]   through ETFs and through large institutions.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.360]   We'll talk about how microcap stocks are traded
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.040]   in the fund, which is a difficult part of the market.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740]   We'll talk about proxy voting.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.680]   We'll talk about fees and how security lending helps
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.840]   reduce the cost to investors.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.040]   We'll talk about several tax-saving strategies
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.720]   used to manage the fund.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.760]   We'll talk about the history of this fund
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   and the three different indexes that
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   it tracked during its history, now tracking the CRISP Total
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   Stock Market Index.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.880]   We've got a lot to talk about today, so let's get to it.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   With no further ado, I am extremely
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.640]   pleased to have Jerry O'Reilly and Rich Powers from Vanguard.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.720]   Jerry is the portfolio manager for the Vanguard Total Stock
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.520]   Market Fund and ETF.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   And Rich is the head of ETFs and index product management
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.000]   at Vanguard.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   So welcome, Jerry and Rich, to Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.240]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   Great to be here.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.680]   Well, before we get into this fund, which
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.840]   is the largest fund when you look at all of share classes
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   of any mutual fund in the world, I just
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.480]   wanted to find out a little bit about your background, Jerry,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.320]   and a little bit about your background, Rich.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.560]   So Jerry, I understand that you were an Olympic athlete.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah, that was a few years ago, Rick.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.920]   Back in 1988, I represented Ireland in the Seoul Olympics
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.560]   in the 1,500 meters.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.120]   Grew up in Ireland and came over to the US,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.320]   went to school at Villanova on a track scholarship.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.400]   And after I graduated in 1987, my job
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.920]   was a full-time track athlete.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.720]   So for a few years, I would go to Europe in the summers.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.440]   And my goal was--
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.480]   I always had this desire from a young kid
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.160]   to someday, hopefully, try and make an Olympic team.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   So fortunate enough that in 1988,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.480]   I ran fast enough that qualified for the Olympics
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.880]   and made it to Seoul.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.480]   A year or so after that, it became evident
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.000]   that I might want to think about another job
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.280]   if I was going to be able to afford a mortgage and a car
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400]   payment and insurance and things like that.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.960]   So fortunately, a very good friend, Jim Norris,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.560]   was working at Vanguard at the time.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.160]   And he said, hey, I'll drop your resume off.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   So I thought I'd be here maybe three or four years
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.680]   and find something else.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800]   Little did I think that I'd be here--
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   I'll be here 30 years next March.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   And it's been a great place to work.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.000]   And started off entry-level at Vanguard.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   And within a couple of years, made my way over
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.680]   to be an assistant trader and have
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.720]   been on the desk for 27-odd years now, yeah.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.920]   That's a fantastic story.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.760]   What about you, Rich?
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.440]   I mean, you've really made your way up,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.280]   been there a long time as well.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.680]   Yeah, I can't compete with Jerry as it relates
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.880]   to kind of a pre-Vanguard story.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   But our paths have some similarities
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.320]   in that we both started on entry-level positions
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.920]   in our retail phone area.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640]   And so I made my way from our phone group
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   over to our portfolio review department,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.920]   really think of that as kind of our product group.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.080]   And for most of my 22-year career,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   I've spent focus on our active lineup.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.760]   So we work with firms like Wellington and Primecap
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.600]   and have them run active equity portfolios for us.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.880]   And we have internal active capabilities
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.040]   in our fixed income group.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.400]   And so I was part of a team that looked after those managers,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.880]   chose managers to deliver active mutual funds to our clients.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.120]   And then about six years ago, I moved into this role,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480]   where my team and I are leading the ETF and index product
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.320]   management function.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.880]   And really, that has three dimensions to it.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.800]   We work with some of our larger and sophisticated clients
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.400]   to help them understand our product
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.480]   relative to the marketplace.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.600]   Two, we do surveillance of the marketplace.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.520]   As Frick, as you know really well,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.840]   the indexing landscape has changed pretty dramatically
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.560]   over the last decade or so.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.240]   And so we were the eyes and ears for the organization
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.440]   as it relates to that.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   And then the last part of our job is designing new products
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.280]   and improving existing products.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.720]   It's really a testament to Vanguard
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.840]   that they retain people for so long.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.880]   I mean, you've both been there more than 20 years.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.360]   Jerry, you'll be there 30 years here soon.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.840]   That's really fantastic.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.640]   I've heard it's a great place to work.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.680]   I want to get into the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.360]   And by that, I mean everything-- the institutional shares,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.120]   the admiral shares, the ETF class shares.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   Altogether, it's the same portfolio.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.200]   Am I not mistaken?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.520]   I mean, this is the same portfolio, just different share
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   classes, correct?
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   Correct, yes.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.920]   On the actual managing of the fund, Rick,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.120]   if you think about it this way, to me, it's one pool of assets.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.520]   And so whether cash flow is coming in in the form of--
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   if it's institutional, if it's admiral,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.280]   whatever the class might be--
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.000]   it's just cash flow coming into the fund.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.720]   So I, in terms of managing the fund,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.600]   I don't need to concern myself like, oh,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   which channel is this coming through?
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   Because it's just cash flow into the fund.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.160]   So obviously, my goal as the manager
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.240]   is to make sure that the fund is really keeping tight
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.200]   tracking with the benchmark.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.480]   And so that sounds pretty easy, but there's
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.040]   a lot of moving parts in there.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.000]   So there's cash flow, like I mentioned.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.280]   We work with a data team that gets in here
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.080]   at 7 o'clock in the morning to make sure
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.840]   that the data, the indexes that we're actually looking at,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.440]   that all of the corporate actions that
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.720]   might have happened the previous night,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.200]   that they're all accounted for.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.800]   So that when I get in, that I make sure
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.280]   that the index I'm tracking is the exact index.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.760]   And we're talking like a spot on,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.880]   like no discrepancies whatsoever.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   Then throughout the course of the day,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.040]   you have all these different index changes
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.880]   that we get notified that are going to be effective
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.440]   at the end of the day.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.720]   And so we need to position the portfolio so that 4 o'clock,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.560]   our fund replicates the index spot on.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.440]   And so any index changes, we need to factor that in.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.560]   And usually, that's going to mean that I need to buy.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.480]   So I'm going to have to sell something to fund that buy.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   And so we could have a dozen of those
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.280]   that happen on any given day.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.720]   And it could be syndicate offerings.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   It could be Dutch auctions.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.200]   It could be numerous different corporate actions
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.720]   that you need to incorporate that into it.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.160]   And then you get to the point around 3 o'clock, Rick,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.920]   where you actually generate your trade list.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.080]   So if I have $600 million coming into the fund,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.520]   some of it's institutional money.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   Some of it's admiral.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.120]   Some of it is cash tenders that might
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   be going on in the portfolio.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.520]   I sum it all up.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.840]   I have my trade list.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.040]   Let's say it's $600 million.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.960]   And now it's up to me to trade that.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.360]   I know my benchmark is the close.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.560]   I then-- because at Vanguard, we kind of wear two hats.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   You're both the trader and the portfolio manager.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   So I know exactly what the strategy needs to be.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.800]   I know that it's a cash flow trade.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.520]   So most of that trading, I want to be
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.040]   able to participate in the auction,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.720]   because that's how our funds price--
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.920]   whatever the closing price is in the particular--
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.800]   whatever exchange that a stock happens to be in,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.120]   the primary listing, that's the benchmark for us.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.760]   So I know that that's what I need
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.320]   to be able to buy at that price or maybe even better.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.200]   And so we put a portion of it into the auction.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.120]   And you need to have your orders down there
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.960]   by a certain cutoff time, depending
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   whether a stock is a New York-listed stock or NASDAQ.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.360]   And any residual names, then it's
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.160]   up to me to put a strategy together how
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.840]   I plan to trade these names.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.120]   So there's lots of moving parts.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.320]   And the great thing is we have a fantastic team.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.200]   We have about 25 traders on the desk,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.080]   roughly split half and half--
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.440]   well, maybe a couple more on the domestic side.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.920]   And so that if my plate gets too full, Rick,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   I know that I have two or three traders that I can count off
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   to help me with the workload to make sure
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.480]   that at the end of the day, we're 100% invested.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.200]   And that's really ideally what you want to be in an index fund.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.120]   You don't want to have any kind of a cash drag.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.520]   You want to make sure that you're 100% invested.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.840]   And then at the end of the day, we basically can run reports.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.680]   We have multiple eyes that sign off.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.920]   I sign off.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.720]   We have a desk supervisor that sign off.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.320]   And we have someone from our risk area
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   that signs off to make sure that the fund is
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.240]   where it needs to be.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.360]   So lots of moving parts.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.000]   Just to circle back to the fund itself,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   based on what's on the Vanguard website at this time,
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.440]   the fund value is $1.3 trillion.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.400]   That's all different share classes.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.720]   But in aggregate, this pool of assets is $1.3 trillion.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.520]   Now, I went to the indexers website
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   and calculated that the value of the index, the total US stock
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.680]   market index, which is a float adjusted--
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.880]   and we'll get to what that is in a minute--
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.240]   right now is about $45 trillion, $45 trillion.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.920]   So this fund, the way I calculate it,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.240]   this fund, total stock market index funded Vanguard,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.160]   is about 3% of the US market float adjusted.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.400]   And by float adjusted, it's the shares
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.200]   that are outstanding and available to rate.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.560]   Is that fairly accurate?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.000]   You're in the ballpark.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   You are in charge of 3% of the entire US stock
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   market with just this one fund, which is incredible,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.080]   quite frankly.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.800]   It's a lot of responsibility.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.720]   Now, Vanguard in aggregate has about $8 trillion.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.800]   How much of that is in US equity of the $8 trillion?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.280]   Well, on our desk, which is the indexing desk,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.320]   we're $4.5 trillion, roughly.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.640]   Now, I think we also have plenty of external managers,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.200]   and we have our internal QEG, which is quantitative group.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.840]   They would be on top of that.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   I don't know what the total equity would be.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   I don't know, Rich, if you would know what the bond portion is
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.880]   that we could subtract that out of the 8?
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.400]   I would ballpark it, that US equity investment's probably
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.000]   in that $4 to $4.5 trillion level
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.200]   when you sum up what the equity indexing group runs
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.760]   across the funds and ETFs, as well as the active equity
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   strategies that Wellington or PrimeCat run for us.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.520]   So it's fair to say that about 10% of the investable US
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.640]   market is owned in some way, form, or fashion
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.320]   by Vanguard investors.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.080]   Is that accurate?
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   I would say you're in the right zip code.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.760]   OK.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.480]   OK, well, I just want to get it all done.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.720]   It's a phenomenal amount, and a lot of responsibility.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   A lot of people's retirements at stake, if you will,
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.640]   based on what you guys are doing.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.720]   So we all greatly appreciate it, including myself, by the way.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.520]   Full disclosure, I own a couple of the Vanguard funds,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   including the total stock market index funds.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.560]   So you are my portfolio manager.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.640]   Let's get into the index itself, because it really
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.600]   has a kind of a history.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.760]   And I've been involved a little bit of this,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.160]   because I followed the indexing industry for over 25 years,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   and especially this particular fund.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.480]   It started in 1992, which, Jerry, that was the year
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.400]   that you joined Vanguard, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:55.920]   That's right.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.000]   1992.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.320]   And the original index that it tracked
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.120]   was called, at that time, the Wilshire 5000.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.600]   Now, there wasn't 5,000 stocks, but the company, Wilshire,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   called it 5,000.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.840]   There was actually more than that at the time.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.080]   Now, that index is the Dow Jones US Total Stock Market Index.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.440]   So this was the original index.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.080]   And, Jerry, when you came on board
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.520]   to start working with this fund, it was 1994.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.920]   So you were there kind of at the beginning of it,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.680]   when assets started to flow in, because it
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.760]   did take a little bit of time before people
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.080]   realized what it was.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   But it was the first total US stock market index fund
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.000]   to be created.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.400]   And I was excited about it at the time, I recall.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.640]   But there was--
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.480]   I had a conversation with Gus Sauter
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.040]   after this fund changed indexes.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.920]   And I asked why you left the Wilshire 5000 back in 2005,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.560]   and you went to something called the MSCI Broad Market.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.880]   And he said that you, at Vanguard,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.840]   were the ones who had to make a lot of changes to the index,
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.720]   because there were some real problems with the index.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   Is that fairly accurate?
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.000]   It is.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.120]   I mean, I would say back then-- your memory is correct, Rick.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.880]   Back then, the Wilshire 5000, there were a couple of things
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.280]   I would point out.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.680]   So number one, in terms of managing money towards it,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.440]   one of the big issues that we had
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.120]   is that it was not float-adjusted.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.800]   So you could have a name that was getting added
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.280]   to the index-- and let's just use round numbers, Rick.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.080]   Let's say there's 100 million shares outstanding,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.160]   and insiders owned 70%.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.320]   So really, the float was 30 million shares
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.040]   available to the public.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.640]   The way that it was managed back then
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.680]   is that we would be forced to buy it as if 100 million shares
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   was outstanding.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.680]   And obviously, that would be problematic.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.360]   As assets grew, you're trying to buy this name as if 100 million
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.160]   shares are outstanding.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   70 million shares are held by insiders or some private equity
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.880]   firms, whatever the case might be.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.200]   And we had massive impact on names
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.600]   when they were getting added to the index.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.520]   So Gus, I know, at the time, was very much in favor of, hey,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.800]   we need to be in a position where
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   we need to talk about float-adjusting the indexes.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.480]   And so once we went to float-adjusted indexes,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.280]   it became much more manageable to trade names
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.360]   when they got added to the index.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.840]   And I would say the other big change--
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.360]   Rick, and you mentioned it already--
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   was that there was far more constituents back then.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.440]   And there was well over 5,000 names in the benchmark.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.560]   And so I would say, from managing it,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   there was probably more of an optimization tilt
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.320]   to managing the fund, where it's difficult to own
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.640]   every single name when you have that many.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   And if you look at today, the CRISP index,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.240]   it's 3,800-odd names in there.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.640]   And so that has been a problem with just US market structure
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   in general, that just the number of names going public.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.520]   Private equity was relatively small back then.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.840]   So if you needed capital, you became
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.080]   a publicly listed company, whereas there's
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.840]   lots and lots of companies that are very, very large today
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.240]   that are private.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.000]   They're not trading publicly.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.280]   And I think the exchanges are aware of that
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.680]   and trying to come up with ways to entice more people to go
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.840]   public sooner.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.200]   But I would expect that number in the CRISP index
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.160]   to rise over time as well.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.200]   Before we went from the Wilshire 5,000 to CRISP,
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.160]   there was an index in the middle.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   And that index was the MSCI Broad Market.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.280]   And this change created a problem.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   I had written a book called All About Index Funds.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.760]   And I realized right away that there
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.080]   was a whole bunch of micro-cap stocks in the Wilshire 5,000
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.960]   that you had to sell to get to the MSCI Broad Market.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Because the MSCI Broad Market was 3,000 names.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.680]   It was fairly close to the Russell 3,000.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.480]   So you had 1,000 or 1,500, whatever, micro-cap stocks
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.640]   that needed to be sold.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.280]   And I remember that whole process going on,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   where it took you, I don't know, what, two years?
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.920]   Or it took you quite a long time to liquidate
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.880]   all of those micro-cap positions,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.480]   only to turn around and buy them back again in 2013,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   when you switched indexes again and went to the CRISP.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   And CRISP is the Center for Research and Security Prices,
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.920]   CRSP, which is kind of an affiliate
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.320]   of the University of Chicago.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.640]   So explain, how do you deal with all this micro-cap?
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.800]   I mean, you had to sell it.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.360]   Then you turned around, and you had to rebuy it.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   I mean, micro-cap is a fairly illiquid market.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.600]   And I got a lot of questions on the Bogle Heads
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.200]   about, how do you manage the micro-cap side of this?
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.560]   Yeah, so you're right.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.200]   Micro-caps, if we look at it, those
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.920]   are by far the most difficult.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.800]   And back when we did that transition,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   I mean, the thing we did, Rick, was we took our time.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.280]   We were opportunistic.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.080]   Some of these micro-caps, there are days
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   when they don't even trade.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.720]   Or if they trade, it's for a couple of hundred shares,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.120]   1,000 shares.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.760]   And if we had size and a name, we would certainly--
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.400]   one of the things about trading is there's a trade-off, right?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   So if you have a name that is a relatively small weight, which
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.120]   most of these micro-caps tend to be--
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   you're talking fractions of a basis point--
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.520]   it doesn't make sense that if you need to sell it,
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.920]   to have huge impact on that name,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.080]   since it's not really going to cause much
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   in the way of any kind of significant tracking
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.760]   error to the fund.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.880]   So the way we thought about that was,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.680]   let's be smart about how we trade these names.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.560]   And if it takes time, it takes time.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.040]   But we will be opportunistic.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.200]   We're going to be out there.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.920]   I mean, the US market structure is fairly complex.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.800]   You've got 16 different exchanges.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.040]   You've got 45 different pools of liquidity.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.240]   You've got dark pools that are available.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.720]   We've got brokers sending us indications of interest
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.680]   where they can tell us, here are names
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.440]   that we're trafficking in today.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.760]   So we would take our time and trade those names
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.800]   if we were opportunistic.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.680]   So I find a buyer in one of the dark pools.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.240]   Boom, I may be able to trade five days worth of volume
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.840]   in a minute because the other side showed up.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.760]   But we certainly weren't going to,
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.000]   if we were selling those names, have a lot of impact,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.400]   push the prices down, just because on a particular day
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.920]   we were out there, there didn't happen
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.080]   to be any buyers out there.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.680]   So we were opportunistic about it,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.800]   working with our peers in investment risk
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.440]   that let us know, hey, these names,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.560]   even though they might be a lot,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.280]   they really represent very little risk to the portfolio.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.880]   So we really were just opportunistic
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.040]   in terms of how we got into them.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.960]   And then, you know, CRISP came along.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.840]   And I would say CRISP methodology
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.080]   was probably the closest align to what we thought,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   here's what proper indexing is
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.280]   in terms of how you manage index funds.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.080]   They had buffers in there
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.880]   so that you didn't have too much in the way of turnover.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.360]   When we have rebalances now,
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.640]   we're able to do it over an extended period of time,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.880]   we're able to do it over five days.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   So the idea of doing that and, you know,
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.080]   being able to spread that trade over five days
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.920]   rather than doing it in one day
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.240]   was a huge benefit to our shareholders
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.720]   because we were able to minimize the impact
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.040]   you would otherwise have if it was done in one day.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.000]   So there were lots of things
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.520]   that we liked about CRISP methodology,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.640]   how they handled large IPOs, how they handled syndicate.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.720]   We were able to take advantage
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.600]   of the liquidity available in the market
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.320]   so that they would get added sooner to CRISP
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.280]   maybe than some of the competitors.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.800]   So there were lots of things we liked about it
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.240]   and we think we're at a good spot today, Rick.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.400]   - Another thing we like about it
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.040]   is they're not charging as much money
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.800]   as some of the other index providers for the index.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.640]   (laughs)
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.240]   You know, saves us a little money.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.760]   Okay, very good.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.720]   Rich, I wanna jump to exchange traded funds
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.000]   because in 2001, Vipers were launched
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.080]   and Vipers were the, at the time the code name,
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.360]   the word exchange traded fund
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.720]   didn't really exist back in 2001.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.360]   So Vanguard came up with this thing, Vipers,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.280]   and I forgot what it stood for, but it's an ETF
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.400]   and they eventually dropped the Vipers name
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   and just went with exchange traded fund or ETF.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   But these were launched in 2001
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   and they were launched as a share class of an existing fund
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.240]   which was completely unique, a brilliant idea, by the way,
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.960]   which Vanguard patented.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   And could you talk about this
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.840]   and then as you talk about it,
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.160]   also talk about the benefit
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.320]   to even the open-end share class holders because of ETFs.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   - Yeah, Rick, it really was a really seminal moment
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.160]   for Vanguard in terms of entering the ETF category
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.280]   as it allowed us to reach more and more investors
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.800]   that we couldn't access through our index mutual funds
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.120]   because of payment for distribution dynamics,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.280]   but ETFs allowed us to reach advisors and individuals
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.560]   at a much lower cost
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.240]   through different discount brokerage platforms.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.520]   Interestingly, we just celebrated our 20th anniversary
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.480]   in ETFs back in May.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.960]   The total stock market ETF, ETI,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.120]   just hit that 20-year anniversary
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.200]   and it's one of the largest ETFs today.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.680]   We have 1.9 trillion in ETF assets in our US lineup.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.440]   The benefits of the multi-share class structure
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.240]   were really compelling for our ETF lineup very early on.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.120]   So what we were able to do is attach an ETF share class
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.320]   to an existing large fund, like the total stock market fund,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.880]   and on day one, have that ETF have a very low expense ratio,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.040]   incredibly broad diversification
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.480]   because it's simply a share class
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.600]   and existing big pool of assets
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.560]   that Jerry now manages today.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   And what that means,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.400]   it allows the fund to track its benchmark really well.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   And so all that created a nice tailwind for our early ETFs
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.800]   and that they were able to hang it off in the existing fund.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.960]   They track well, they're inexpensive,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.440]   and investors were able to access the US market
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.640]   in a really low cost way and get great tracking.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.760]   So 70 of our 82 US ETFs
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.840]   have that multi-share class structure.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.440]   The more recent vintages of our ETFs that we've launched
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.560]   are standalone ETFs.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.840]   So more conventional,
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   like many of our peers in the industry offer.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.160]   And that just speaks to the fact
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.320]   that where we had a mutual fund, an index mutual fund,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.200]   we hung an ETF off of that mutual fund where we could.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.680]   And now we're in the midst of launching some new strategies
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.040]   where a mutual fund didn't exist.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.840]   So launching the ETF is the better answer
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.920]   given where we see client interest aligning.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   Your point around tax efficiencies is a compelling one
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.080]   in that one of the things that happens with an ETF,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.040]   there's probably layers of tax efficiency
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.600]   that we can talk about with respect to an ETF.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.280]   The first of which is the ETF is based upon
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.160]   an index-based strategy, right?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.320]   We know by and large,
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.000]   most index-based strategies are lower turnover.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.600]   So that in and of itself creates tax efficiency
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.000]   for our portfolio.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.160]   But with respect to the ETF,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.960]   there's two other really important dimensions to it
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.360]   that give it that extra ability
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.520]   to minimize capital gains distributions.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.560]   First, the training of the ETF shares in the secondary market.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.400]   So we'll stick with total stock market as an example,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.440]   but if Rich Powers owns VTI
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.680]   and he wants to sell that exposure
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.560]   and I go into my brokerage account and I decide to sell it,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.000]   there's a market maker on the exchange
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.040]   who's gonna see that order come through
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.480]   and then they're gonna pair that sell order
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.680]   with say a buy order from Jerry O'Reilly
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.720]   who wants to buy that same VTI ETF in the marketplace.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.160]   So that training activity amounts
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.960]   to almost a billion dollars a day in our ETFs,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.440]   which means that activity never makes its way
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.760]   to the portfolio.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.320]   Jerry doesn't have to lift a finger
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.640]   to trade that activity in the portfolio, buy or sell,
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.720]   because it's just simply exchanging shares on the exchange.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.440]   So that really creates part of the compelling nature of ETFs
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.920]   when it comes to tax efficiency.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.520]   The other component is how ETFs transact.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.600]   At the point at which maybe there is more buy activity
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.240]   for an ETF on the exchange,
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.560]   a market maker is going to say,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   "Well, I need to go and acquire more shares from Vanguard
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.640]   "to satisfy this greater buy activity.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.280]   "And so I'm going to go out and accumulate
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.440]   "the underlying stocks that represent that index,
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.720]   "hand them to Vanguard,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   "and Vanguard's gonna give me shares in exchange
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.560]   "to sell to investors out in the marketplace."
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.400]   The same thing happens on the way out.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.040]   And this is where the power comes in,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.520]   where if there's a lot more sell activity
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.960]   on the ETF in the secondary market,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.720]   instead of having to sell the couple thousand stocks
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.840]   in total stock,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.280]   Jerry's team is gonna hand the market maker those stocks,
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.680]   they're gonna sell them into the marketplace
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.000]   to satisfy that redemption activity
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.920]   that's happening in the market.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   So shareholder impact on terms of the tax efficiency
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   and positioning of the portfolio doesn't happen
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.960]   because there is no selling stocks in the portfolio
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   to meet that redemption.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.480]   We're handing those stocks to the market maker
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.400]   who then sells them outside of the portfolio.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   - And let me put my two cents with you.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.880]   And I call it a double-edged sword here on taxes
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.080]   because, correct me if I'm wrong, Jerry,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   when you get a cash redemption through the mutual fund side,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.920]   you could sell shares of stock
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.040]   that are at a high cost basis
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.440]   so that there's very little impact, if any, on the fund.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.200]   There might even be a loss to the fund
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.760]   because some of the shares you may have bought
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.000]   at a higher cost.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.960]   And then when there is a redemption on the ETF side,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   a creation unit redemption,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.240]   you can push out stock that's at a low cost basis.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.320]   So again, pushing out some of the tax liability,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.200]   unrealized tax liability in the fund.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.480]   Is that close to what you do?
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.360]   - Yes, yep.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.080]   Every day, Rick, we're going to basically net
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.360]   all of our cash flows coming into the fund.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.240]   Let's say you have a redemption coming in today.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.720]   I very well might have a corporate action going on
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.520]   where one of the stocks in my portfolio
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.280]   is being acquired by someone else for cash.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.320]   Or we could have some other corporate action,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.000]   and part of it is, hey, you're going to get
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.320]   X number of shares of this stock, the acquirer,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.800]   and you're also going to get X number of dollars per share.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.680]   So I kind of net everything together.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.200]   Around three o'clock, I'm going to know,
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.680]   hey, do I actually have to sell today
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.560]   or am I actually in a buy mode?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.080]   And I can tell you through 27 years on the desk,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.760]   it's been massively skewed towards the buy side
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.320]   where cash flow is coming into Vanguard.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.000]   The ETF activity that Rich just referred to,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.800]   I could get a billion coming into total stock today
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.600]   in ETF creates.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.320]   I actually don't see it at all.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.400]   I just know that my assets have increased,
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.680]   but I'm also receiving a basket of stocks,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.320]   and obviously we're then giving them shares of the ETF.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.840]   It's going on, I'm aware of it, but it doesn't impact.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.280]   There's no trading involved whatsoever.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.040]   If I do need to sell, I need to sell.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   And whether that, you know, sell futures
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.760]   or sell a basket of stocks, at three o'clock,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.720]   it's like, hey, there's 300 million leaving the fund today.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.560]   I am going to need that fund redemption.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.160]   Otherwise, I'm going to leave the fund levered
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.120]   tomorrow morning, which would not be good
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.680]   because then you start to introduce tracking error.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.720]   But the number of, I would say, sell days
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.000]   are few and far between relative to,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.720]   I mainly tend to be on the buy side
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.320]   as cash flow is coming in.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.440]   And ironically, the stronger the market's doing,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.040]   it tends to be people want to buy even more and more,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.920]   you know, coming into the fund.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.080]   - Let me ask a question about the basket of stocks
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.360]   that comes in as an ETF, because the way that it works
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.000]   is the authorized participant looks at the basket of stocks
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.560]   they have to put together.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   Now, that basket is not 3,900 stocks.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.400]   That basket is much smaller than that,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.200]   maybe half that size.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.440]   - Yeah, I think it's actually right around 1,900, yeah.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.160]   - So they send in a basket of 1,900 stocks,
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.560]   which 1,900 are probably the most liquid stocks,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.480]   which leaves another thousand stocks
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.240]   in order to make this portfolio balance out.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.720]   It means if you're getting a lot of money coming in
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.400]   through the ETF side, that you then, your desk,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.960]   would have to go out and start buying
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   a lot of micro-cap stocks, I would imagine.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.080]   - Yeah, well, so the way that we would think about that,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.920]   Rick, is this, you're right, most of those 1,900,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   obviously they start off large cap, go down to mid, small,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   and maybe even a little below that.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.520]   But you're right that if all you got was ETF activity
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.280]   for months and months and months,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.440]   you would start to notice like, hey, the tail,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.120]   the micro-cap, the smaller cap,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.360]   and you're starting to fall behind a little bit here.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.880]   So what we do, you know, what I do as the portfolio manager
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.960]   on the fund is every week, I basically run a trade list
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.080]   Monday morning that focuses on the bottom two deciles
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.640]   of my portfolio, which is kind of that small cap,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.840]   bottom of small cap, and these are the names
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.320]   that are difficult to buy, they're illiquid,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.280]   and I split them up between a number of traders
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.940]   on the desk, and we hold them for the week.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.280]   We trade them Monday through Friday.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.440]   And we are totally opportunistic.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.140]   So if a name happens for whatever reason,
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.120]   you find a natural, so I'm a buyer and, you know,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.620]   on Wednesday, a huge seller shows up, we'll get done.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.680]   Now those names, they may not represent a huge weight
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   in the index, but we focus on that tail throughout the week
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.600]   to avoid exactly the point that you're bringing up
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.360]   is if all you're doing is getting your 1900 shares
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   or basket, you know, stocks in every day from the ETF,
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.160]   at some point, you're gonna look a little light
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.940]   on the lower end of small cap and maybe even below that.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.740]   And so the way we get around that is we consistently
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.300]   trade them, we break it into small groups,
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.860]   and we have brokers who specialize in micro cap,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.060]   small cap names, and believe me, on days when they have
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.020]   the other side, we're trading with them.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.580]   And so we use all of the different tools at our disposal,
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.580]   dark pools, you know, different type of ATSs.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.100]   If there happens to be someone who has a big liquidation
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.700]   going on, and we find out about it, we'll see if we can pair
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.380]   off with any of our buys versus a big sell that might be
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.500]   going on in the market.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.180]   So we do that every week to make sure that we never do fall
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.340]   behind there.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.080]   So obviously the tracking error of the fund,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.380]   that's of paramount importance to managing the fund.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.540]   And we make sure that that stays as tight as possible.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.300]   And that's how we get around that issue of making sure
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   that on the smaller names that we're right
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.300]   where we need to be.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.020]   - I wanna talk one more time about taxes,
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.780]   because this fund does have a fairly sizable
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.020]   unrealized gain.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.020]   And I calculate something like a $700 billion capital gain.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:57.380]   I looked at the annual report and the fund cost
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.540]   to acquire the stocks was about 550 billion.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.960]   And the value of the fund is around 1.3 billion.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   So call that $750 billion of unrealized gains.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.380]   And as long as money's coming into the fund,
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.220]   it's not a problem.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.220]   But at what point, you know, money starts coming out,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.980]   will you end up having to realize some of these capital gains
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.220]   and distribute them to shareholders?
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.260]   - I'll get us started and Jerry for the job.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   Well, if you look at the current position of the fund,
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.140]   also from a realized gain perspective,
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.660]   you would see about a 1% realized loss in the portfolio
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.780]   for this fiscal year.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.100]   And so, you know, what Jerry's team is able to do there
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.980]   is look selectively at different names
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.460]   where we can maybe harvest some losses along the way
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.700]   to ensure that if we know there's a big corporate action
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.240]   coming down the road that's gonna result in a capital gain,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.780]   we have a little bit of an offset there
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.980]   that doesn't require us to bear any type of,
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.800]   or minimizes the amount of risk that we're gonna bear
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.180]   in the portfolio.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.360]   Now, so there's different levers we can pull there.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.660]   Obviously, we talked about the in-kind nature of the ETF
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.140]   that allows us to export out different cost slots
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   as shareholders redeem from the portfolio.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.620]   But I think maybe the place I would kind of finish here
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.540]   and Jerry, please jump in would be,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.580]   you'd have to think through like
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.380]   what would precipitate investors to begin to redeem
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.180]   in some significant way, right?
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.820]   And so usually when that happens,
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.020]   and our shareholders are as well-behaved as any,
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.180]   but when that would happen,
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.020]   it would likely be when the markets are going down.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.660]   And so that would put us in a position
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.100]   where the tax basis of the portfolio and complexion
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.540]   has changed pretty meaningfully
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.780]   so that that unrealized gain you mentioned, Rick,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.980]   is gonna be meaningfully less
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.340]   and we can be much more selective
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.660]   as we kind of fund those redemption.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.220]   And then the last thing I'll say is that
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.300]   we have the ability to in-kind in the mutual fund side.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   So sometimes plan sponsors will move their 401(k) plan
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.460]   or their pension plan from the Vanguard product
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.660]   to someone else's.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.780]   And more often than not,
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.940]   we are in-kinding those assets to the new provider
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.580]   rather than Jerry and his team selling those down.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.220]   And so I think you look at the unrealized number,
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.860]   you'd say, wow, that's kind of a scary prospect.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.580]   You have to think about how we got here.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.540]   We've had an incredible bull market and strong cash flows,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.820]   but the unwind to that in terms of
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.180]   why investors will walk out the door,
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.740]   we have different levers to pull,
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.820]   be it the market, the tax basis of the fund has changed,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.900]   and/or we can in-kind on the mutual fund side
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.460]   for those large institutions.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.860]   - Yeah, that's a great answer.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.300]   I would say, Rick, the number one thing,
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.660]   if I'm on the desk today and I find out,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.300]   hey, someone is looking to redeem substantial size
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.620]   out of one of our portfolios,
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.140]   you try and get some color.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.820]   And then the first question I'm gonna ask,
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.940]   is this something that is,
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.980]   are they open to doing an in-kind?
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.700]   And a lot of times it's not on the day.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.740]   It maybe is two weeks ahead of time.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.740]   XYZ is looking to move money wherever.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.620]   The first question that we're gonna ask on the desk,
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.700]   is it open to in-kind?
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.420]   Obviously it's favorable for us from a tax point of view
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.700]   and from a trading point of view.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.340]   And a lot of times for the client who's leaving,
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.940]   rather than them receiving cash
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.540]   and then turning around with whoever
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.500]   the new asset manager might be and buying again,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.740]   it's easier for them as well,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.980]   as long as they have,
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.380]   we're going from one, the same light benchmark
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.980]   or a benchmark that's very close to it.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.660]   And Rich also mentioned tax loss harvesting.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.380]   We have a great accounting team
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.900]   that notifies us multiple times a week where we stand.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.580]   And so there are times throughout the year
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.340]   where it may be opportunistic to put on a tax harvest.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.700]   So if we see, hey, we have a number of names here
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.420]   that we have huge losses on,
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.380]   that we can harvest those names.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.300]   You do have to be aware
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.980]   that there's a wash sale period of 30 days.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.620]   So we work very closely with the risk teams
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.820]   to make sure that you don't have any kind of sector bets
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.660]   where you're selling a huge amount of names in one sector.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.100]   So we do that in such a way
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.060]   that even if you do have a tax harvest,
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.540]   that in terms of potential tracking error,
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.460]   it is minute.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.380]   And so that's something that we have available as well,
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.980]   as well as some of the other tools
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.500]   that Rich spoke about as well.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.020]   - Let's get into the cost of running this fund.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:27.220]   This is news to me when I was doing my research
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.420]   prior to the call,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.620]   that the cost of running the fund
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.300]   according to the 2020 annual report
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.700]   was around $422 million.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.860]   That was the total cost to run the fund.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:47.860]   Of that, 176 million was attributed
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.980]   to the investor share class.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.220]   So this share class is really expensive.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.620]   It's like 41% of the cost of the fund.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.300]   And I was actually surprised
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.460]   that there are still people in the investor share class.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.060]   I mean, why hasn't everybody moved over
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.740]   to the admiral share class, which is less expensive?
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.620]   - Yeah, a couple of things to inform that, Rick.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.540]   One, the investor share class is used
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.060]   by target date portfolios that Vanguard offers.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.740]   And so there's a range of different target date portfolios
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.700]   that we offer for individuals, institutions,
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.100]   and it scales as AUM scales.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.020]   And so for a portion of our clients,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.860]   they're using the, in the target dates,
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.340]   they're using the investor share class.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.300]   There's a portion of clients who can't access admiral shares
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.060]   on other brokerage platforms.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.540]   So because there's kind of minimum holding,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.940]   minimum size requirements to get into admiral shares
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.180]   and some other brokerage platforms
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.740]   aren't able to conform to that,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.620]   the only available option for them would be
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.380]   to utilize the investor shares with those portfolios.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.780]   So those are kind of the two kind of drivers
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.540]   as to where the vast majority of investor AUM would occupy.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.340]   But certainly I've been here
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.900]   and Jerry's been here long enough to know
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.780]   that that was 100% of the AUM 20 years ago.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.420]   And then over time, it's slowly whittling down.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   And I would expect that trend to continue.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.500]   If you just look at the organic activity
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.420]   within the portfolio, the preponderance of the assets
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.540]   are coming through the ETF,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.460]   then through institutional and admiral,
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.580]   secondarily with investor shares,
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.980]   mostly being a function of rebalancing or new plans
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.540]   that decide to use a targeting fund.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.340]   - I find it interesting that ETF is so cost efficient
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.940]   at Vanguard.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.660]   The total cost for a management and administration
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.140]   of the ETF share class was only 36 million.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.460]   So it was a fraction of what the investor share class
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.540]   or the admiral share class was,
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:59.540]   clearly very cost efficient to Vanguard
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.860]   to have people in the ETF share class.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.180]   And Rich, you could discuss that.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.100]   - Sure, when you think about who the historical users
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.140]   of ETFs have been, financial advisors have carried the water
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.620]   as it relates to their adoption at Vanguard
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.300]   and elsewhere in the marketplace.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.780]   And most of those financial advisors
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.740]   will custody their assets
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.940]   at some other discount brokerage platform,
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.900]   or they might be at a broker dealer.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.020]   And so when you're thinking about kind of the scale benefits
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.620]   that come from hundreds of millions or billions of dollars
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.340]   being in other platforms,
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.700]   it certainly removes some costs from how Vanguard
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.820]   has to support those products day-to-day administratively.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.460]   And so the rough number here is about 10%
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.180]   of our ETF AUM is on a Vanguard platform
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.340]   and the balance is held at some other discount brokerage.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.380]   And so as you'd expect,
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   the cost that would come with those types of assets
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.700]   would be pretty materially lower
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.100]   than where those kind of directly sold
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.620]   or directly held clients that might be in a Vanguard platform
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.140]   either in a 401k plan or in a direct investor relationship.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.020]   - And one of the reasons why ETF share classes
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.740]   have a lower expense ratio,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.140]   although it's only one basis point lower than Admiral shares
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.460]   is because it doesn't cost as much, correct?
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.460]   - That's exactly right, right?
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.700]   So a couple of years ago,
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.020]   some of our investors would have noticed that
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.980]   historically the Admiral shares and our ETF shares
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.420]   of the same fund would have had the same expense ratio.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.940]   So I think total stock a number of years ago
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.140]   would have had a five basis point expense ratio
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.020]   for Admiral and ETF.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.580]   But now as we sit here today,
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.060]   we've seen the, because of the growth and adoption of ETFs,
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.100]   we've seen the ETF expense ratio, because it's scaled,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.900]   move down to three basis points
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   and the Admiral shares is at four basis points,
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.580]   both incredibly compelling,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.940]   but certainly highlights the cost that we bear
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.300]   in managing those portfolios,
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.820]   administering those portfolios is different for the ETF.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.020]   - One other thing about cost
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.700]   is that you're able to do security lending.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.100]   And I noticed again in your annual report
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   that you had about $6 billion out of security lending
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.700]   and you're able to acquire from that
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.580]   about $170 million of income to the fund,
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.580]   which helped to offset the expenses at the fund.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.860]   So, Richard, if you could talk about security lending
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.260]   and how that helps to offset the cost.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.580]   - Yeah, so securities lending is an exercise
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.900]   that we've been involved with for a long time.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.940]   We only lend securities
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   on our equity portion of our portfolios.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.740]   We don't lend any fixed income securities.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.220]   Our analysis there is that the cost to administer
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.740]   is not worth it relative to the benefit that you got.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.940]   And so, but there is clearly a benefit for,
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   on the equity side.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.900]   And so what we'll do is we have a securities lending desk
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.500]   that's operates on behalf of our funds
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.300]   and goes out and lends those securities
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.780]   that are in great demand.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.060]   And there could be any number of reasons
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.460]   why those securities could be in demand
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.420]   because of a opportunity from a corporate action
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.260]   that's coming up.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.660]   Perhaps there's activity from a hedge fund
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.180]   that maybe is interested in acquiring additional shares.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.140]   And so we'll lend those securities in our portfolio
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.180]   up to a limit where we see that there's value.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.140]   We actually approach securities lending
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.660]   from a value-based approach.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.940]   Some of our peers will basically lend everything they have
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.060]   and try to just maximize the amount of income
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.580]   they generate by lending
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.540]   as much of the portfolios available.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.740]   We only look for those opportunities
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.540]   that are really ripe, have a big return for minimal lending.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.420]   And so we employ this approach
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.700]   where we'll lend those securities out in the marketplace.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.380]   In return for that lending,
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.700]   we'll effectively get back cash
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.860]   that we'll invest in a money market instrument
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.820]   that will earn a yield.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.820]   And the return to our shareholders
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.980]   for that special name that we've lent out in the marketplace,
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.260]   there's a premium that was likely paid,
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.220]   but then also there's a capture of the yield
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.860]   that happens for the duration
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.540]   of that lending on that security.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.180]   And so that income that is generated
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.180]   is returned to the fund that is lending that security.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:18.140]   And so about 95% of the income that's generated
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.620]   goes back into the fund NAV.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.980]   That five or so percent
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.740]   that doesn't go back into the fund NAV
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.980]   covers the cost of us administering the program.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.580]   And so that's a hallmark of the Vanguard program
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.180]   that differentiates us from many of our peers
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.820]   because other firms will lend securities out
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.100]   and they'll do a 50/50 split
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.580]   between the management firm and the lending fund.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.860]   And so we believe that if you're lending securities
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.780]   and you're bearing some level of risk in the marketplace,
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.260]   you should be compensated with all the rewards after cost.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.860]   And so that's the approach
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.580]   that we take in our lending program.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.700]   Jerry, I know you have a couple things to add there.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.580]   - Yeah, absolutely, Rich, great summary there.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.500]   So we work very, very closely, Rick,
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.620]   with our counterparts in SEC lending.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.740]   And there's certain funds
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.500]   where there's huge demand for the holdings
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.060]   from the sell side who are,
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.300]   and maybe it's someone who's looking to short a stock, right?
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.500]   And you have to secure the borrow,
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.700]   so they'll call Vanguard, as Rich mentioned.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.460]   They have to put up collateral.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.780]   A lot of times, 102% of whatever it is
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.340]   that you're looking to borrow.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.220]   And then we're gonna invest that with our fixed income teams
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.100]   to make sure that, and the one thing I would point out there,
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.060]   they're very conservative
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.580]   in terms of how they invest that money.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.420]   And I know if you go all the way back to '08,
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.020]   some asset managers were trying to swing for the fences
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.700]   in terms of how they invested that money,
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.900]   and it came back to bite them a little bit.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.020]   So SEC lending is one way,
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.780]   and if you look at some of our small cap,
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:47.740]   particularly in the small cap growth in value,
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.740]   it's meaningful, the amount of dollars
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.140]   that they receive from SEC lending,
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.420]   to the point where, I've seen it in years
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.660]   where it's north of eight basis points,
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.780]   nine basis points to the fund
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.540]   that's coming in from SEC loan.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.420]   And as Rich mentioned, 95% of that
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.260]   is going directly to the funds that loaned it out.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.180]   So that's one way, you mentioned earlier,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.100]   Rick, about the four basis points
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.620]   for the expense ratio and total stock.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.820]   So I would say SEC lending is one way
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.700]   that we try to eat into that in terms of,
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.660]   can we do better than the four basis points
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.180]   that we should underperform the benchmark?
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.220]   SEC lending is gonna help with that.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.380]   We've also, we have a very, very experienced desk.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.540]   I think the average tenure on the desk is about 13 years.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.740]   So over time, you learn strategies,
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.900]   proprietary strategies about how to work index changes,
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.460]   rebalances, complex corporate actions.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.580]   And so we've also been heavily involved
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.540]   in syndicate offerings, whether that's just a company
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.420]   that is issuing new shares to maybe pay off debt,
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.980]   or whether it's IPOs that are coming along.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.380]   And we have a team that focuses on that.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.260]   So every day, here around 10 after four,
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.180]   you're gonna get the phones will start lighting up
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.060]   with brokers calling us about syndicate offerings
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:45:59.900]   that are happening.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.060]   And obviously, Vanguard's gonna be a top three holder
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.380]   in almost every name out there.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.380]   So we tend to get the call.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.500]   And as long as it's greater than 5% of the shares outstanding
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.180]   index providers are gonna make the share change.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.860]   Crisp will make it tomorrow if we get the call tonight.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.300]   And so we will participate if we think it's going
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.700]   to add incremental value to the fund.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.220]   So very, very busy here around 4/15
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.700]   with calls coming in on syndicate offering.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.740]   And 2020 was probably one of the busiest years
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.860]   we've ever had on that front.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.220]   I think we had over 400 between syndicate and IPOs.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.460]   So very busy.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.460]   Those are some of the ways that we'll try
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.100]   and eat into that expense ratio.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.620]   And so if we can do that in a risk control manner,
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.300]   it's a win-win.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.580]   - From what I understand from reading the numbers
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.700]   in the annual report, about 170 million of income
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.780]   came in from security lending.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.700]   The total expenses of the fund were around 420 million.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.260]   So about 40% of the expenses of the fund
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   were made up with security lending.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.260]   Is that fairly accurate?
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.820]   - Yeah, I mean, I would say, Rick,
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.500]   that you're looking at total stock.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.900]   But depending on the fund, that's not at all surprising
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.220]   because that group, as Rich mentioned earlier,
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.380]   95% of the revenue that they bring in
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.940]   goes directly to the funds that loaned out those securities.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.100]   And in terms of total stock,
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.140]   I've seen that number be a basis point,
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.900]   maybe a one and a half basis points.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.140]   And when you consider that our expense ratio is four,
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.100]   that's a meaningful contribution to the value add
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.300]   for the fund.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.980]   - Let's go into just a couple more things
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.900]   because I know we don't have much time left.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.460]   I wanna touch on this because it is a little bit
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.860]   of a controversial topic.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.860]   And I know that you may or may not be involved in this
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.620]   to what extent you are, you could let me know,
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.100]   but it has to do with voting proxies.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.380]   And Vanguard is a large part of the US market,
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.380]   10% of the market, if you will.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.740]   And how does that all work at Vanguard
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.860]   so that shareholders understand
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.660]   how proxies are voted at Vanguard?
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.940]   - Yeah, so a lot of times, Rick,
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.020]   we will get a call here on the desk from an issuer
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.900]   looking to talk about a proxy issue.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.420]   And we are fortunate, you can imagine,
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.780]   like say Total Stock where we have 3,800 securities,
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.260]   if every company, if I was to be involved in that,
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.580]   I couldn't do my job, right?
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.220]   Because a lot of these are not simple issues,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.380]   they can be complex.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.500]   So fortunately, we have an investment stewardship group
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.540]   run by John Galloway at Vanguard and his team,
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.340]   and they will analyze all of these proxies.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.820]   That is a team that's dedicated
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.620]   to everything proxy related.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.940]   So if a call comes in, immediately we send that call
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.740]   or give them the email address for John's group.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.500]   This is the team you wanna get in front of,
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.860]   and they will then obviously reach out,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:59.140]   either email conversations about what it is the issue is.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.540]   And there are certain things that that group,
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.620]   in terms of their principles,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.460]   if you think about it, we are the ultimate owner, right?
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.140]   We're gonna own companies potentially forever.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.700]   So it's in our best interest to make sure
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.980]   that the boards are gonna represent
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   the interests of shareholders.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.380]   So that group that John runs,
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.100]   they look at things like executive compensation,
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.940]   board composition, oversight of strategy and risk,
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.300]   as well as shareholder rights.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.620]   So those are some of the key principle things
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.820]   that they would look at.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.180]   I know they subscribe to some of the proxy advisors
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.220]   like ISS and Glass Lewis,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.820]   but that's just one of the tools that they use.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.500]   And they're gonna make decisions
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.580]   what they feel are in the best interest of our shareholders.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.940]   And it's not always aligned with the companies.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.740]   You know, one of the high profile ones
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.580]   that we recently just had was the Exxon proposal,
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.940]   proxy fight.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.140]   And, you know, Vanguard voted
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.500]   with the dissidents on this one,
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.340]   where they supported two dissident director nominees.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.460]   And I would also say it's very transparent.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.620]   If you wanna see how did Vanguard vote
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.140]   on a particular proxy,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.740]   you have the ability to go online
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.980]   and see exactly how we voted on it.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.180]   And so fortunately from my point of view, Rick,
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.780]   I really just passed those calls
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.180]   onto that investment stewardship team
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.980]   and they do a fantastic job analyzing it.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.020]   And I know they have folks who specialize
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.820]   in certain regions.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.100]   I know there's a team in the UK as well
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.780]   that handles same thing for our European counterparts,
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.140]   but it's a robust team that works very closely
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.340]   with the issuers
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.100]   and they'll hear all sides of the argument
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.580]   and then they will make decisions
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.060]   based on what they feel is in the best interest
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.540]   of our shareholders.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.220]   - Thank you for that answer, Jerry.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.860]   I appreciate the thoroughness of it.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.260]   And there's also always a lot of noise out there
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.180]   about these types of things.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.740]   So thank you for covering that.
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.980]   I wanna get into one last question
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.940]   and this could be a little bit personal on this.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.740]   You've heard the charges of indexing.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.540]   In fact, the worst one I guess you could say
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.980]   was in the Atlantic Magazine called,
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   "Could index funds be worse than Marxism?"
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.460]   Indexing is ruining the market
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.740]   and indexing is creating corporate slots
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.620]   and shareholder gorillas and so forth.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.060]   And this is bad and Congress needs to look at this
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.500]   and they need to break up these index funds.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.980]   You're there and every day doing this.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.580]   I mean, is any of this something to worry about?
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.620]   - Sure, Rick.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.260]   I think there's a couple of things we can look at
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.540]   to kind of disprove this notion
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.860]   that indexing is creating some type of harmful effects
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.700]   in the marketplace.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.860]   So first one you would look at is the impact on trading,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.700]   right?
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.300]   Equity indexing is an example.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.340]   About 5% of all trading that happens in the marketplace
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.180]   can be tied to an equity index.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.300]   That in and of itself tells you
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.780]   that while indexing as a strategy has grown remarkably,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.700]   the nature of indexing as a long-term buy and hold
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.340]   certainly isn't kind of infusing itself
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.300]   into terms of how price discovery
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.100]   is happening in the marketplace.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.020]   You can look at dispersion of returns over time
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.820]   over this last 20 or so years.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.340]   Not a noticeable difference in dispersion of stock returns
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.820]   over that period.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.460]   - When you're talking about dispersion of returns,
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:25.020]   you're referring to dispersion between stocks, correct?
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.100]   - That's correct.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.620]   Rick, if you look at the Russell 3000, for example,
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.100]   and we define dispersion as plus or minus 10%
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.700]   over the index.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.740]   If you go back to the early '90s,
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.740]   when indexing was still,
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.500]   if you wanna talk about indexing
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.620]   in terms of what does it represent of mutual funds,
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.580]   that was maybe around the 10% back then.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.420]   It's now growing to about 50%
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.300]   in terms of ownership of mutual funds.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.500]   And over that time period, the dispersion,
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.460]   so plus or minus 10% of the Russell 3000,
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.060]   that's remained consistent at 70%.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.580]   So the argument you sometimes hear
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.100]   on top of the Marxism argument is that,
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.780]   hey, indexing is lifting all boats, right?
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.060]   As indexing, they're just buying
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.140]   and they don't even care about it.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.460]   When you have dispersion levels at 70%,
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.860]   that tells me that there's opportunities there
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.140]   for good active managers to outperform.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.220]   So the rise of indexing,
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.620]   I don't think is hurting that at all
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.620]   in terms of opportunities available.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.500]   And on the trading side, as Rich mentioned,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.900]   if I think about,
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.940]   Rich mentioned the number 5% of daily trading,
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.300]   that's a very, very small portion of the overall pie.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.780]   If I think about even on our desk,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.500]   on some of our busiest days,
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.900]   $2 billion is not that unusual
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.220]   that I might trade here on the desk.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.060]   If you think about an average trading day, Rick,
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.820]   it's about $450 billion.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.740]   So my $2 billion that I'm spending total stock,
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.660]   it's less than half a percent of an average daily volume.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.420]   And it's spread out over 1,200, 1,500 names.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   And believe me, those names,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.900]   I'm making sure that whatever I put in the auction,
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.780]   it's not gonna be too impactful.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.820]   So price discovery is alive.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.940]   There are names, if I think about our REIT fund,
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.900]   probably in terms of ownership,
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.340]   it's probably highest among our REIT names,
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.540]   especially if that REIT happens to be in total stock
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.700]   and it's maybe an index 500.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.740]   There are lots of names that are massively underperforming
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.100]   where we're at today.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.740]   And even though the ownership level might be
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.460]   in the high 20s, 30% in terms of passive ownership
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.580]   across the board.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.140]   So the fact that that name happens to be in an index,
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.820]   there's bad news that's coming out,
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.740]   that fund is gonna get it.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.780]   I've seen lots of different things out there.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.700]   I tend to focus on what are the positives
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.540]   that indexing has brought to the market here?
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.900]   I attended a number of these Boglehead forums
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.460]   when you were on campus.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.020]   And the number of people who came up to me and said,
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.060]   "Hey, I've been investing in your 500 fund
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.580]   "for 30 odd years.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.180]   "It's put my kids through college.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.780]   "It's helped my retirement."
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.100]   I mean, you wanna talk about walking back on air
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.700]   after that conference when you get a bunch of those stories.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.900]   That makes you feel pretty good about the fact
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.620]   what indexing has brought to so many people.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.740]   I just feel really passionate about the fact
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:10.740]   that indexing absolutely benefits absolutely hugely
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.620]   over any kind of detractors that you might see out there.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.380]   And a lot of the stuff that I read out there
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.100]   doesn't hold any water at all.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.980]   - We all thank you for everything you're doing
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.180]   and your dedication to helping us as investors.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   I know we've run out of time.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.660]   I wanna thank you, Jerry and Rich, very much
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.820]   for taking the time today to talk with us
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.180]   about Total Stock Market, Index Fund,
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.180]   and a lot of things having to do
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.020]   with how things work at Vanguard,
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.900]   including the proxy voting, which I appreciate you
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.300]   chiming in on.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.380]   On behalf of all the Bogleheads,
