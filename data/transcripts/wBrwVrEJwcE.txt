[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   Starting and running a company is it's a full-on contact sport.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.880]   You have to have a bias to action.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.560]   Like you have, you're, you're, you're faced with a hundred decisions a day.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280]   You don't have definitive answers on any of them.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.520]   And you have to make this, you have to actually act anyway.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   Cause if you sit and analyze, you know, the world will pass you by.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.680]   A good plan executed violently is much better than a great plan executed later.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   It really rewards like aggression, contact with reality, constantly
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.480]   testing hypotheses, screwing up a lot.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   Changing your mind a lot, you know, revisiting things.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.600]   It's thousands and thousands of crazy real world variables all intersecting.
