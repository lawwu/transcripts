[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   As we were growing up as children, would you ever think that the United States federal government
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   would tell, I believe it was the state of Missouri, "Someone said something we don't
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.480]   like in a particular town hall. Take down the recording from YouTube." That happened.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.120]   That is a violation of the Constitution of the United States. That is against everything in
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.360]   the traditions and laws and culture of the United States. That is outrageous. And yet it happened.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.520]   An injunction issued in a court case last year, Missouri et al versus Biden et al. The argument
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.000]   made in the court case, which the judge accepted, which is extremely well-supported by the record
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.440]   in front of him, is that various actors within the United States government puppeted the tech
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.320]   companies and used them as cat's paws to do, frankly, shocking violations of constitutionally
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   protected freedoms like the freedom of speech. And that they were not on the level of, "We've
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.680]   built this unaccountable, hard-to-inspect system of LLMs and heuristics, and we started turning
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.000]   off a lot of people's feeds and Facebook." But no, there was an individual person in the White
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.840]   House who was sending out emails like, "When are you going to address me on this tweet, guys? We
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   can't have things like this anymore," et cetera, et cetera. Again, a feature of the United States,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   we are very good about keeping records and transparency and having a functioning legal
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.760]   system. And the record before the court is like, "I was following along as this was happening,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   and what was happening was much worse than I understood to be happening." This is literally
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   written in the decision, by the way, which I would urge everyone to read. There was an individual
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.440]   in a non-governmental organization which was collaborating with the governmental organizations
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.760]   in doing this, which said, "To get around legal uncertainty, comma, including very real First
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320]   Amendment concerns, comma, in our ability to do this, rather than doing it in the government
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920]   directly, we are outsourcing it to a bunch of college students who we have hired under the
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.120]   auspices of this program." What? One, just as a dangerous professional here, you violated the
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.080]   character from The Wire, Stringer Bell. Stringer Bell's dictum on the wisdom of taking notes on a
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.040]   criminal conspiracy. But you literally wrote that down in an email. The outrageous part is not that
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   you wrote that down in an email. The outrageous part is you, with full knowledge of it, engaged
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.560]   in something that is outrageously unconstitutional, immoral, illegal, and evil, to the applause of
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.760]   people in your social circle. And everyone involved in the story thinks that they're the good guy in
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.720]   it. If you write that email, you are not the good guy in the story. One thing in the judicial record
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.920]   of this case is that the White House and other government actors routinely overreached and asked
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.600]   the tech companies, "We would like you to censor this and this and this and this." And the tech
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.040]   companies said no in a bunch of cases. And so continuing to negotiate for the right outcome
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.760]   rather than the one that people in power merely want is important. Maybe we should have spoken
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.800]   out more and spoken more boldly about it. Maybe when it was like the routine case that the White
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.640]   House was telling Facebook, Twitter, et cetera, et cetera, everyone knows the names. Companies on a
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.760]   tweet-by-tweet, communication-by-communication basis, giving direct orders on, "There's a certain
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   kind of speech act which we find vexatious, and we would like you to stop that everywhere."
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.320]   Very plausibly you should get on the nightly news and say, "I received the following email from the
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.840]   White House that says we should stop this everywhere. If you point a gun at me, I will
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.720]   comply with this at the point of a gun. That is what it will take." It almost requires civil
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.200]   disobedience in the sense of they publish this email, like, "Here's what the White House just
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.680]   sent me," they take down this tweet, and now Twitter's market cap has just collapsed because
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.640]   people realize the political implications of what Jack Dorsey just got up and said at the time.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   Then the solution is that tech companies need to basically sacrifice their capacity to do business.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.840]   You need to have a risk tolerance, right? Every business everywhere, including in the financial
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.800]   industry, including in the tech industry, is balancing various risks, and the risk tolerance
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.040]   was poorly calibrated. One can achieve results in the world by doing things like embarrassing
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.640]   government officials, and embarrassing a person in a position of authority is not a zero-risk
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.240]   behavior. It is relatively low-risk in the United States relative to other places. Maybe we need to
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.600]   have a certain amount of intestinal fortitude, like a, "Okay, you've asked us to do something.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.720]   You've threatened us with taking away all the wonderful toys and the great business models
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.920]   that make this an extremely lucrative area to work in, and to sacrifice a value that is very
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.720]   important for us to continue to do that. No, we're going to fight you on this one."
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.480]   The comms-trained part of me is like, "Don't use the word 'fight'." We are going to collaborate
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   with stakeholders across civil society to achieve an optimal outcome balancing the multiple disparate
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   and legitimate interests of various arms of the government and civil society and blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.600]   Sometimes that requires fighting. We should fight when it does.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.640]   [END]
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:42.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
