[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.040]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.220]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.000]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.020]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.720]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.220]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samer Hattar
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.360]   as my guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.840]   And now, my conversation with Dr. Samer Hattar.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.980]   Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.620]   My pleasure.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.840]   You are best known in scientific circles
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.000]   for your work on how light impacts mood,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.960]   learning, feeding, hunger, sleep,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.200]   and these sorts of topics.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.100]   So maybe you could just wade us into
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880]   what the relationship is between light
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.380]   and these things like mood and hunger, et cetera.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.800]   Sure.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light for vision.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.480]   So when you wake up in a beautiful area,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.480]   beautiful ocean, light is essential.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240]   The sunrise, the sunset.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.180]   So that's your conscious perception of light.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.320]   But light has a completely different aspect
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.860]   that is independent of conscious vision.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.760]   And that's how it regulates
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   many important functions in your body.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.640]   I think the best that is well-studied and well-known
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.960]   is your circadian clock.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.340]   And the word circadian comes from the word circa,
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.500]   which is approximate, and DNA is day.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.240]   So it's an approximate day.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.740]   Why is it an approximate day?
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.820]   Because if I put you or any other human being
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.500]   who have a normal circadian clock
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.100]   in a constant conditions,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   with no information about feeding time,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.580]   about sleep time,
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.320]   about what time it is outside,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.420]   you still have a daily rhythm,
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.520]   but it's not exactly 24 hours.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.400]   So it will shift out of the solar day
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.560]   because it's not exactly 24 hours,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.680]   and hence the name circadian.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.120]   How does that rhythm show up
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.520]   in the tissues of our body?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.560]   It shows up at every level that we know we studied.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.540]   It shows up at the level of the cell.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.680]   It shows up at the level of the tissue.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200]   and it shows up at your behavior.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.280]   The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.040]   You sleep and you're awake and sleep
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.500]   at the 24-hour rhythms.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260]   The period length of the sleep rhythm on average
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.900]   is 24.2 hours.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.680]   So you'll be drifting 0.2 hours every day
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.540]   out of the solar day if you don't get the sunlight.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.640]   So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.580]   to an exact day.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940]   So now your behavior is adjusted
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.620]   to the light-dark environment or the solar day.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.760]   It's part of the brain that is not consciously driven.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.460]   So you actually do not know when it happens
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.440]   or when it doesn't happen.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.320]   And that's what we'll get into
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.240]   when I tell you why light affects your mood
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.860]   and why sometimes people don't know
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.900]   how to deal with light to improve their mood,
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.580]   for example.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.700]   What's the relevance?
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.660]   I mean, why should we care about that short difference?
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.720]   So let's do the math.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.940]   If you shift out 0.2 hours a day,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.860]   in five days, you're shifting out one hour.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.900]   So you're literally one hour off
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500]   in your social behavior in five days.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.540]   In 10 days, you're two hours off.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.660]   And if you're an organism that is living in the wild,
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.460]   shifting out of the right phase of the cycle,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.740]   you could either miss food or you could become food.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.320]   So it's really essential for survival.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.440]   I think it's one of the strongest aspects
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.420]   of survival for animals to have the anticipation
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.320]   and the adjustment to the solar cycle.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   what is the machinery that allows that to happen?
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.580]   And how does that machinery work?
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.980]   So we knew that in mammals, including us,
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.080]   we are mammals, humans,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.460]   that the eyes are required for this function.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.280]   So if humans are born without eyes
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.980]   or the optic nerves are damaged,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.780]   humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.540]   So we know that the eyes are required.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.060]   In the human retinas,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   there are two types of photoreceptors.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.380]   They are called rods and cones because of their shapes.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.820]   And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy,
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.160]   which light is made of,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.080]   and they change it in a way to an electrical signal
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.780]   that allow us to build the image of the environment
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.840]   in our cortices.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.360]   However, people have found,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.820]   including me with the work of David Burson
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.900]   and Ignacio Provencio,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.020]   that there is a subset of ganglion cells.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.240]   The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   their axon, leave the retina,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.260]   and project to the brain.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100]   So these were taught to only relay rod and cone information
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.840]   from the light environment to the brain.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.880]   We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   are themselves photoreceptors
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.920]   that were completely missed in the retina.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.240]   And these are the photoreceptors
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.580]   that relay light environment subconsciously
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.200]   to the areas in the brain
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.660]   that have and house the circadian clock
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.200]   or the circadian pacemaker,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.000]   which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.540]   to the central brain clock
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.280]   that allows them to entrain
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.660]   to the 24-hour light dark cycle.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.700]   So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.720]   that behave like photoreceptors, essentially.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.900]   I think it's worth mentioning now
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.700]   that people who are pattern vision blind,
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.480]   so people who cannot see but have eyes,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.260]   many of them still have these cells,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.480]   these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.700]   and can essentially match or entrain, as we say,
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.460]   onto the light-dark cycle.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.460]   In fact, they possibly have no problems
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.800]   in circadian photoentrainment.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.820]   They'll have enormous sleep-wake cycle.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.920]   But they're totally blind.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.540]   But they are totally image blind.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.600]   And what's really interesting is that,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.920]   and this story I heard from Chuck Seisler,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.820]   so I'll give him credit,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.600]   that some of these people who are image blind,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.580]   usually they get dry eyes
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.040]   and they give them a lot of pain.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.880]   And doctors used to think,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.660]   oh, since they are image blind
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.920]   and they're getting dry eye,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.500]   why don't you just remove their eyes?
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.720]   They're not using them anymore.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.060]   And the minute they would remove their eyes,
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.640]   they start having cyclical sleep problems,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.100]   indicating that now they are not in training
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.360]   to the light-dark cycle
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.100]   and are having cyclical jet lags
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.300]   when their clock shifts
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.900]   through the light-dark cycle.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.300]   That's really interesting.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.060]   And I hear from a number of blind people,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.160]   a lot of them have issues with sleep,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.660]   I think, in part because they don't realize
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.280]   that they too need to see light
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.860]   at particular times of day or night
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.840]   in order to match their schedule.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.280]   Absolutely.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   What is the proper way to interact with light
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.180]   in the first part of the day?
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.780]   Honestly, I think the easiest thing is waking up.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.120]   Get as much light as you can.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.840]   Into your eyes.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.220]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.640]   Your system is primed.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.600]   If you're entrained, it's primed to get light.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.860]   The sun should be out.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.040]   Even when it's cloudy,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.560]   you're going to get enough intensity
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.520]   to help you adjust your cycle
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.580]   to the day-night cycle.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.760]   These are general rules of thumb,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.020]   but how long do you recommend people go outside?
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.960]   So if you do it daily,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.340]   I would say 15 minutes.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.500]   If you don't do it daily,
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.720]   you may want to increase it.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.260]   You do it more, it doesn't hurt.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.080]   And I'll tell you, if you're sensitive,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.380]   you don't even have to go in the sun.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.380]   You could be in the shade.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.420]   There's going to be so many photons
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.440]   out there in the shade.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.880]   It's going to be perfect.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.840]   Okay, and if for some reason
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.820]   one finds themselves
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.020]   very far north
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.440]   and it's very, very dense cloud cover,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.000]   how long and at what point
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.420]   should somebody consider
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.440]   using an artificial light source
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.840]   to mimic the sunlight?
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.600]   Yeah, honestly,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.080]   this is where we don't have
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   a lot of information still
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   because this is where
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.480]   we're going to discuss this
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.640]   maybe in more detail
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.400]   that if you put humans
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.800]   in artificial conditions,
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.560]   the circadian system
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.120]   is very sensitive to light.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   But in reality,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.020]   in the real environment,
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.600]   light also is affecting
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.580]   other aspects
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.860]   that are independent
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.980]   of the setting
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.440]   of the circadian pacemaker.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.060]   Okay.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.640]   And these,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.260]   which we call
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.500]   the direct effect of light
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.580]   on mood, for example.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.920]   so that is very hard
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.620]   to figure out
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.440]   what intensity
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.260]   you need to use.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.160]   And we haven't done
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.780]   enough experiments
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.420]   because the system
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.260]   has been discovered
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.160]   just recently.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.220]   But yeah,
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.500]   I mean,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.700]   if you're honestly,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.140]   if you're that far north
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.080]   and you're in the winter
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.880]   and you want to get,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.760]   make sure you don't
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.160]   use these light boxes.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.540]   I would suggest that
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.080]   personally.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:57.520]   okay,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.480]   so I think we've
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.640]   nailed down
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.920]   that first part of the day.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.380]   Basically,
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.640]   it's get 10 to 30 minutes
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.900]   depending on how bright it is
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.760]   and try and do that
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.440]   as often as possible
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.220]   to give the system
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.700]   a regular...
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.440]   Daily is the best.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.080]   This system
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.460]   is really about,
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.940]   and you'll see that
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.960]   even for the effect
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.460]   on depression,
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.980]   it's about multiple days.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.660]   So you don't have to worry
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.940]   if you missed it one day,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.640]   you know,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.920]   stay longer if you want.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.560]   But if you're in a hurry
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.860]   and you want to do other stuff,
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.100]   that's a great recommend.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.560]   So you might want to compensate
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.480]   with some extra time
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.180]   if you missed a day
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.520]   or two.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.600]   I've heard you say before,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.900]   it's entirely possible
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.700]   to get severely jet-lagged
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.480]   without traveling.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.060]   Absolutely.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.620]   Simply by staying in,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.720]   being on your phone too much,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.660]   not getting the sunlight.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.500]   And you saw this
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.680]   during the pandemic.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.020]   A lot of people mentioned
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.460]   that their sleep-wake cycles
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.480]   suffered a lot
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.620]   because if you're not going out
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.160]   and if you're staying at home
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.620]   and you don't have big windows
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.480]   and you're waking late,
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   waking up late,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.280]   and then you're using
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   very bright light
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.240]   till late at night,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.440]   your body's going to shift.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.520]   And now,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.180]   your day is going to start
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.340]   instead of like really
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.360]   when the sun comes up,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.340]   let's say at 6 o'clock
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.880]   in the morning,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.540]   it's going to,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.580]   your day is going to start
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.740]   at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.340]   That's what your body's going to think
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.700]   is the beginning of the day.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.440]   So then you're not going to be able
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.300]   to sleep at 10 o'clock at night
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.620]   because now that's really,
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.060]   for your body,
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.500]   it's completely different timing.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.320]   There is this idea of chronotypes
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.780]   that we all each intrinsically
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.480]   have a best rhythm
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.940]   of either being a morning person,
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.760]   you called yourself an early person,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.180]   or a night owl,
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.880]   or more of a kind of standard,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.360]   you know,
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.380]   to bed around 10.30,
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.420]   up around 7 type thing.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.760]   And I think there are now good data,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.640]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.960]   from the National Institutes of Mental Health
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.080]   and elsewhere showing that
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.440]   the more we deviate
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.140]   from that intrinsic rhythm,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.560]   the more mental health issues
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.720]   and physical health issues
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.580]   start to crop up.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.420]   So there is great data on this
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.500]   and there is a couple of things
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.580]   that complicate this.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.560]   The first is
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.880]   the people who usually are late.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.380]   What do you mean?
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.280]   People that wake up late
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.800]   and go to sleep late?
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.360]   Go to sleep late and wake up late.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.540]   They have an overwhelmingly
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.140]   higher level of depression
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.100]   because human notice
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.620]   that people who go to sleep early
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.460]   and wake up early,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.600]   they do better in life.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.440]   They notice that.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   They just perform better.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.940]   They perform.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.040]   But the question is,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.500]   is that intrinsic to the system
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.560]   or is that society?
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.060]   Because society starts things
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.220]   usually early or late.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.120]   That's a hard question.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.880]   We discriminate against late risers.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.260]   In a way, we discriminate.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.680]   And I'm not so sure
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.820]   that the circadian system
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.840]   is that variable
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.020]   in the human population.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.760]   I mean, clearly,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.540]   there are maybe
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.640]   some genetic factors
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.660]   that make a small percentage
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.760]   of like everything
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.600]   with a bell shape.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.940]   But I think most of the time,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.060]   the light environment
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.040]   may play a role.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.700]   And once,
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.400]   as we've talked about,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.300]   this is a long-term effect of light.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   Once you get into a rhythm,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.860]   it's hard to break
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.200]   out of that rhythm
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.880]   because if you start sleeping late
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.920]   and waking up late,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.000]   you're not getting
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.900]   the morning sunlight.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.480]   Right.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.160]   And so you're just
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.960]   going to be late.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   It seems to me
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.200]   is the case
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.860]   is that the only way
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.840]   to really know
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.920]   if you're meant
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.700]   to be an early bird,
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.440]   as they call it,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.100]   an early person
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.940]   or a late person
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.480]   or somewhere in between
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.040]   is to get morning sunlight
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.840]   and figure out
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.160]   whether or not
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.060]   that makes you feel better.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.520]   So what should people do
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.040]   in the afternoon
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.520]   slash evening time
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.220]   in terms of their
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.060]   light viewing behavior?
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.720]   I mean,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.800]   the best thing to do
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.420]   is to let the natural light
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.820]   creep in into darkness,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.280]   right?
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.360]   That would be the best.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.640]   but clearly
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.100]   that would be inefficient.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.120]   You want to go home,
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.880]   you want to read,
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.620]   you want to talk
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.380]   to your kids,
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.820]   you want to talk
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.520]   to your family.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.300]   So I think,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.780]   you know,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.180]   it's nice to extend the day.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.320]   I don't think that's wrong
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.040]   if you somehow
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   can block
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.420]   that light
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.140]   from affecting
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.180]   your circadian clock.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.340]   you do keep your home
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.940]   quite dim to dark
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.440]   at night.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.920]   I am an extreme,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.980]   but I measured it
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.560]   for myself
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.420]   and I asked Reiji,
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.960]   my wife,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.080]   if she's okay with it.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.380]   She also liked the dimness.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.520]   Both of us can see well
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.200]   in dim conditions,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.280]   but I think you have
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.360]   to measure it for yourself.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.600]   You really have to do,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.020]   it's a very simple experiment.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.540]   Just try to dim the light
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.640]   as much as you can.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.220]   I call it the minimum
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   amount of light
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.660]   you require to see
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.480]   comfortably.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.100]   You know,
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.700]   use red light
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.580]   that is very dim
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.320]   if you want to keep
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.900]   the room for sleeping.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.860]   Red light
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.680]   that is very dim
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.700]   has very small effect
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.100]   on circadian clock
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.540]   and below 10 lux of red light
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.460]   literally doesn't affect
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.320]   sleep at all.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.800]   So there are ways to do it.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.540]   I've seen you
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.520]   check your phone
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.620]   after dark
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.880]   once or twice
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.460]   and you did it
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.480]   by sort of
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.540]   pointing your phone
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.060]   away from you, right?
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.100]   It actually makes sense
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.600]   that, you know,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.440]   if you shine a flashlight
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.060]   in your eye,
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.640]   it's much brighter
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.240]   than if you shine
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   a flashlight on the camera.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.720]   direct line.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.640]   So if you just look
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.300]   on the side,
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.180]   most of the light
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.140]   is going to go this way
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.940]   and you're on the same.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.560]   And even when I check
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.020]   sometimes,
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.180]   I check it so fast
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.260]   and switch it off so fast.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.860]   So ideally,
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.120]   I should not check
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.280]   iPhones and iPads.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.700]   I don't use iPad at night
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.480]   because it's hard
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.500]   to lower it enough
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.960]   because it's a huge.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.880]   But even my iPhone,
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.580]   I try not to use it at night.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.320]   You had a,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.580]   what I consider
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.220]   absolutely landmark,
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.200]   beautiful paper
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.180]   published in Nature
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.220]   a few years ago
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.720]   showing that
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   if you disrupt
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.420]   the exposure to light
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.440]   or the timing
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.600]   of the exposure to light,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.360]   that there are dramatic effects
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.680]   on the stress system
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.860]   and on the learning
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.820]   and memory system.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.640]   So if I interpret
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.300]   that correctly,
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.880]   that could mean
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.300]   that when we view light
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.380]   and how much light
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.180]   could make us feel happier
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.220]   or less happy
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   or even depressed,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.720]   stressed,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.560]   learning, etc.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.460]   Bingo.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.660]   Even if we're sleeping
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.400]   and waking up
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.260]   at the appropriate time.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.580]   Bingo.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.260]   I mean,
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.920]   eventually,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.260]   because we're talking
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.400]   about the whole system,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.900]   eventually,
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.980]   when you start having
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.780]   the other problems,
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.740]   you also develop
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.620]   sleep problems.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.560]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.240]   And in fact,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.880]   now,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.020]   research from Diego Fernandez
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.580]   in the lab
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.940]   have found that
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.020]   now we know
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.400]   that they actually require
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.440]   different brain regions.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.580]   so we don't only have
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.160]   a theory,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.360]   we don't only have
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.220]   a light environment
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.780]   that showed
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.140]   they can be dissociated.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.640]   We know that they use
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.520]   completely different
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.180]   brain regions.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.600]   So the SCN
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.920]   that I told you about earlier,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.660]   the place where
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.720]   the central pacemaker
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.940]   is the one that receives
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.620]   direct input
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.440]   from the retina
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.900]   through the IPRGCs
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.680]   to adjust your circadian clock
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.940]   is not the area
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.360]   that receives the light input
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360]   for mood regulation.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.380]   It's a completely
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.380]   different brain region.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.520]   And what's really amazing,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.940]   this region also receives
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.600]   direct input
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.800]   from the IPRGCs
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.360]   but projects to areas
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.880]   in the brain
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.700]   that are known
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.640]   to regulate mood
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   including the ventral medial
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   prefrontal cortex
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.180]   which has been studied
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.280]   for many years
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.500]   to be impacted
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.800]   in a human depression.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.860]   So just by
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.200]   this amazing serendipity
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.760]   to find
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.280]   that a region
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.300]   that is so deep
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.400]   in the advanced brain
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.460]   like the prefrontal cortex
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.380]   is your executive brain
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:55.400]   is your executive brain
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.320]   one of the most
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.300]   elaborated in humans
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.240]   to see that
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.400]   they receive input
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.440]   from these ancient
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.400]   photoreceptor
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.240]   was stunning to us.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.340]   How does that
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.920]   finding inform
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.600]   daily protocols
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.220]   for you
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.080]   or for other people?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.920]   So that's why
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.500]   we came up
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.840]   with the tripartite model
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.060]   because as a circadian biologist
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.400]   I only thought of light
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.500]   through the circadian clock
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.440]   affecting behavior.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.940]   As a sleep biologist
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.600]   they only thought
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.960]   of the homeostatic drive
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.040]   affecting sleep
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.920]   affecting behavior
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.320]   and for people
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.040]   who study light
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.700]   for vision
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.300]   and other things
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:27.920]   they thought only
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.200]   of the environmental input
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.700]   but now if you put them
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.460]   all together
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.360]   you get with this
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   tripartite model
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.220]   where it's really
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:34.980]   mind-boggling
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.580]   and it makes so much sense.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.700]   The organism
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.660]   doesn't want to depend
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.900]   on a single component
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.940]   but if you could
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.680]   incorporate these three together
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.100]   you could have
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.180]   a beautiful system
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.280]   that is well adapted.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.500]   So let me tell you
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.700]   the sleep-wake cycle, right?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.860]   So we know there is
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.940]   a homeostatic drive
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.240]   to affect sleep.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.380]   You've had beautiful
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.520]   talks about that.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.120]   Which is basically
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.080]   the longer you're awake
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.180]   the more you want to be asleep.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.560]   So that's your homeostatic drive.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.840]   We've talked about
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.000]   the circadian influence
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.520]   of sleep
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.520]   and the fact that
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.360]   light-dark cycle
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.620]   affect the circadian system
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.900]   which eventually
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.740]   affects sleep.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.760]   So these two components
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.460]   are well understood.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.140]   Now the third factor
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.400]   is your direct light
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.600]   or environmental input.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.640]   How much stress
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.400]   how much light
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.080]   you get from there
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.220]   also can highly
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.080]   impact sleep.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.520]   So even if you have
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.460]   a good circadian
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.880]   and homeostatic drive
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.820]   if you're getting
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.940]   light at the wrong
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.700]   time of the day
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.440]   or if you're being
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.520]   stressed and thinking
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.720]   then your sleep
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   is going to suffer.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.820]   So you have to think
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.900]   of the three together
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.820]   to have a beautiful
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.900]   sleep-wake cycle.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.620]   Let's talk about food
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.500]   and eating
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.320]   and appetite.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.000]   You had yet another
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.360]   yes, I greatly admire
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.140]   your success
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.100]   success in this way.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.040]   Yet another
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.100]   incredible discovery
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.540]   showing that
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.300]   there are direct
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.780]   effects of light
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.040]   on appetite
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.200]   and feeding behavior.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.940]   So for somebody
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.320]   who's interested
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.300]   in affecting
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.100]   their eating behavior
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.900]   how should they
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.640]   use light
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.540]   in order to
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.400]   adjust their
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.380]   eating behavior?
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.760]   Right.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.020]   So now that
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.660]   I've told you
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.400]   about all these
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.980]   interactions
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.080]   between the different
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.940]   inputs to the
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.700]   circadian clock
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.540]   just you think
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.880]   about it
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.560]   as an engineer
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.200]   what would be
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.980]   the best thing?
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.820]   The best thing
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.660]   is to know
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.040]   when your food
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.060]   times happen
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.700]   in the day
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.560]   when should you
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.140]   get light
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.100]   and when is
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.780]   your circadian
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.760]   clock in your system?
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.140]   Right?
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.340]   So if you eat
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.280]   at very specific
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.200]   times of the day
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.280]   that's another
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   signal that is
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.960]   telling your body
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.520]   your clock
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.240]   you're in a certain
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.000]   time of the day.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.020]   So if you're
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.660]   having lunch
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.220]   at the correct
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.040]   time every day
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.540]   and you're
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.420]   getting bright light
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.060]   now you have
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.140]   two systems
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.620]   that are
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.300]   informing your
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.600]   clock
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.400]   your clock
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:41.720]   is going to
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.180]   be better.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.120]   So regular
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.800]   mealtimes.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.000]   Regular mealtimes
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.720]   that fit
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.640]   your circadian
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.000]   clock.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.100]   So and in fact
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.220]   if you do that
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.060]   when I started
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.820]   doing this
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.720]   and it helped
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.480]   me lose weight
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.680]   is that I'm
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.460]   exposing myself
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.100]   to the right
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.220]   amount of light
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.820]   dark cycle
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.440]   I'm eating
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.360]   at regular time
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.720]   it is amazing
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.320]   you will be
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.960]   not hungry
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.360]   let's say
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.740]   let's say
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.440]   you eat at noon
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   you will not
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.000]   feel any hunger
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.900]   at 11.45
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.040]   and then all
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.380]   of a sudden
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.160]   the hunger
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.020]   jumps in
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.780]   this is clearly
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.520]   not an energy
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:09.860]   issue
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.660]   because it
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.060]   could not
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.620]   be that
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.140]   drastic.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.380]   Right.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.000]   No the desire
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.400]   to eat
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.000]   is mainly
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.580]   driven by
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:14.960]   these
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.920]   these cues
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.780]   these hormone
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.200]   cues
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.340]   that are
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.900]   very exquisitely
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.480]   timed
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.200]   to
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.640]   sleep-wake cycle
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.320]   but also
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.080]   to light.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   Exactly.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.280]   How regular
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.100]   are you
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.940]   or do you
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.520]   recommend people
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:29.920]   be about
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.540]   mealtimes?
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.260]   Are we talking
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.660]   about down
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.240]   to the minute?
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.060]   like if I
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.400]   absolutely
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:33.660]   not.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.280]   All right
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.900]   plus or
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   so 12 noon
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.500]   is my normal
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:36.900]   lunch
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.740]   let's say
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.440]   plus or minus
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.460]   half an hour.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:40.960]   Okay.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:41.840]   So eat
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.340]   around
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.320]   between 11.30
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.180]   and 12.30
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.360]   if that's the
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.700]   time
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.420]   and it depends
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.060]   if you also
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.040]   do multiple meals
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.500]   remember
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.540]   three meals
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.320]   that's a decision
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.280]   that somebody
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:51.920]   came up with
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.420]   I don't know
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:52.680]   why.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.040]   Nowadays
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.140]   fewer people
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.720]   are doing that
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:54.960]   I think.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.100]   Given our
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.700]   friend Sachin
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.420]   Panda's work.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.740]   right.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.220]   I mean
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.520]   so you
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:58.920]   could have
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.620]   two meals
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.060]   you could
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.500]   have
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   very
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.160]   multiple
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.180]   meals
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.780]   that are
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.420]   distributed
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.040]   across your
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.980]   active time.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.940]   Some people
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.780]   are not hungry
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.400]   early in the
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:08.640]   day.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.120]   They might
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.520]   be late
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.180]   shifted people
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.740]   in which case
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.340]   eating later
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:11.700]   in the day
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.340]   will work
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:12.940]   well for them.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.140]   It will work
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.660]   as long as
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.200]   they don't eat
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.680]   early in the
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:14.940]   morning.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.560]   That's just
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.220]   you have to
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:16.720]   work with
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.380]   your schedule
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:17.760]   with your
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.180]   active
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.660]   schedule.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.380]   What we're
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:19.820]   talking about
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.240]   really is
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.860]   finding your
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.560]   ideal sleep
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.040]   schedule
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.920]   and finding
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.500]   your ideal
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.080]   eating
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.520]   schedule
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   and
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.060]   understanding
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.640]   how those
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.060]   two things
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.620]   interact.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.220]   And you
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.460]   know the
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:29.880]   nice thing
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.260]   as you
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.440]   said
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.100]   finding them
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.520]   out is
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:31.780]   going to
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.140]   help you
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.600]   to understand
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:32.940]   how they
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.380]   interact
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.300]   because we
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.720]   know from
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:34.900]   the
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.560]   tripartite
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.120]   model that
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.480]   they are
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.840]   all
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.460]   interconnected
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.680]   and for
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.420]   each person
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:39.740]   they're going
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:39.980]   to be
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.520]   interconnected
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.380]   differently.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.660]   It's striking
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.260]   to me that
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.200]   in all
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.800]   animals
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.680]   besides
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.360]   humans
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.480]   if they
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.060]   deviate
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:48.680]   too much
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.240]   from the
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.760]   appropriate
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.520]   exposure to
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:50.980]   light and
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.420]   light-dark
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:51.780]   cycle
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.600]   they essentially
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.820]   don't mate
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.420]   and or
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.780]   die and
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.140]   or get
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.740]   killed off.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.760]   but in
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.220]   humans
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:58.980]   we are
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.380]   able to
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.100]   override that
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.460]   at least
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:00.820]   to some
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.260]   extent.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.120]   But the
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.660]   ways in
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.140]   which we
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.980]   suffer
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.240]   appear to
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.720]   be things
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.940]   like obesity
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.480]   metabolic
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   syndromes
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.440]   reproductive
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.480]   syndromes that
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.180]   accompany the
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.920]   other syndromes
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.140]   you know
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.600]   endocrine
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.100]   syndromes
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.440]   and mood
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.000]   and depressive
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.600]   disorders.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.640]   Is there
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.340]   any effort
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.360]   at the level
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.740]   of the
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.460]   nationally
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.680]   or laboratories
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.120]   that you're
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.500]   aware of
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.220]   to try
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.220]   to try
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.760]   and use
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.720]   light in
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.360]   order to
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.380]   improve mood
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:26.880]   and mental
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.160]   health?
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.780]   I mean
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.580]   honestly this
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:28.940]   is my
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.380]   moonshot.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.160]   This is the
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.760]   thing that I
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.460]   think people
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.840]   because it's
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.360]   I say don't
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:34.860]   take a pill
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.600]   take a photon
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.580]   and not I
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.060]   mean you take
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.560]   pills it's
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.000]   important.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.520]   I'm just
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.100]   making it
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.240]   that really
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.000]   we have an
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   opportunity
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.460]   right now
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.020]   with the
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.840]   incredible
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.620]   advances of
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.460]   LED lights
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.080]   of changing
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.800]   spectra of
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.100]   light of
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.880]   regulating
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.100]   intensities
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.800]   and just
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.560]   for simple
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   changes you
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.860]   could really
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.820]   improve sleep
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.520]   wake cycle
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.200]   productivity
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.480]   and still
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:58.820]   you could
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.540]   actually get
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.460]   more done
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.740]   because as
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.180]   we've talked
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.900]   about when you
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.700]   have all these
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.360]   messed up
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.180]   now you have
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.580]   to sleep
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.620]   more but your
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.060]   sleep is
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.780]   fragmented
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.620]   it's not very
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:08.980]   good.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.780]   And you can't
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.500]   focus when you
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.260]   can't focus
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:11.700]   when you don't
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.500]   have alertness
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.000]   when you need
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.880]   the alertness
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.360]   so having
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.960]   all these
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.900]   could allow
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.340]   you to do
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.200]   even more
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.980]   actually at
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.440]   the end
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.140]   than less
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.800]   and that's
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.540]   the exciting
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.280]   part of it.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.920]   Let's talk
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.340]   about jet lag
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.680]   what are the
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.240]   two or three
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:26.780]   things that
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.440]   people can do
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.260]   to adjust
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.480]   their schedule
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.280]   quickly like
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:30.880]   let's say fall
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.500]   classes are
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:31.920]   starting you
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.400]   start a new
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.900]   job or you
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:33.440]   have a baby
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:33.980]   or a puppy
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.480]   or whatever
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.840]   what is the
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   best way to
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   shift the
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.660]   clock quickly?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.560]   So it's
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.100]   very simple
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:39.560]   as we've
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.220]   talked yesterday
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.000]   so imagine
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.480]   you're in
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.420]   the outside
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.000]   with no
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.620]   environmental
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.640]   with no
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.220]   industrial
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.700]   light
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.240]   if you
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.720]   if your
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   body thinks
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:48.820]   you're in
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.640]   early evening
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.120]   and you
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.820]   see a bright
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.660]   light what
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.100]   does this
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:52.500]   tell you?
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.360]   Oh wait
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.260]   this is not
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:54.980]   early evening
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.640]   yet it's
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.480]   still early
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.540]   afternoon or
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.220]   late afternoon
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.520]   so I have
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.340]   to delay my
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.280]   clock to go
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:01.960]   back to late
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.940]   afternoon so
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.840]   if you get
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.920]   light early
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.640]   in the evening
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.540]   it delays
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.200]   your clock
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.340]   so what does
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:08.820]   meaning that
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.380]   makes you want
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:09.700]   to go to
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.260]   sleep later?
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.160]   yes it
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.540]   delays your
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:11.940]   clock so
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.940]   later in
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.560]   the night
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.480]   later in
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.220]   your night
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.780]   and actually
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.300]   it just
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.220]   happens that
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.700]   in humans
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.220]   you get a
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:19.660]   temperature
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.160]   in a deer
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.940]   later in
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.320]   the night
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   low temperature
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:22.920]   in your body
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.140]   after that
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.060]   lights start
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.980]   advancing your
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.300]   clock
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.380]   if I understand
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.980]   correctly what
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.420]   you're saying
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.160]   is if your
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.840]   typical wake up
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.920]   time is say
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.600]   7 a.m
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.100]   then your
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.900]   low point in
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.740]   temperature probably
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.420]   occurs somewhere
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.440]   around 5 a.m
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.020]   and if you
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.780]   view light
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.820]   right around
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.140]   then it's going
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.700]   to essentially
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.420]   advance your
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:43.700]   clock
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.420]   yeah because
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:44.920]   then your
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   body thinks
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.940]   oh it's 7 o'clock
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.700]   so advance your
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.540]   clock by 1 to
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.120]   2 hours
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.900]   but if I were
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.580]   to view light
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.080]   say at 3 a.m
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.600]   then it would
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.340]   probably delay
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.940]   my clock
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.220]   yeah
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.640]   okay
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.780]   yeah so
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.820]   and then let's
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.660]   say I land
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.060]   in a new
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.440]   schedule
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:22:59.860]   I want to
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.300]   adjust to a
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:00.640]   new schedule
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.040]   let's say I
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.760]   didn't manage
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.300]   to do anything
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:02.880]   with my light
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.460]   viewing before
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.800]   I went
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.180]   and I didn't
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.440]   anticipate the
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:05.640]   trip
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.480]   suddenly I'm
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.880]   on a new
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.280]   schedule
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.740]   okay
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.200]   I was told
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.220]   that one
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:10.680]   of the ways
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.080]   to help
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.520]   shift the
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:11.840]   clock
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.360]   and to
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:12.660]   avoid
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.620]   gastrointestinal
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.200]   issues
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.840]   is to
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.900]   eat on
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.260]   the local
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.720]   schedule
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.160]   to start
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.340]   basically behaving
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.040]   like a local
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.320]   even though
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.420]   your circadian
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.040]   clock will take
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.400]   a little bit
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:23.660]   of time
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.220]   to catch up
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.660]   absolutely
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.880]   but you have
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.280]   to remember
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.840]   the light
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.340]   right
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.260]   so let's
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.820]   let's now
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.180]   that we
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:29.700]   explained it
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.260]   very simply
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.840]   let's take
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.480]   a very simple
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.980]   example
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.360]   right
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.600]   New York
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.120]   to Italy
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.900]   that's a
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.700]   simple example
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.580]   New York
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:36.820]   time
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.080]   Italy
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.340]   time
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:37.860]   six hour
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.320]   difference
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.660]   right
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.640]   so let's
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.260]   say you fly
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:40.900]   from New York
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.540]   at night
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.400]   you reach
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.100]   Italy at
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.620]   eight o'clock
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.140]   in the morning
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.760]   what is the
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.480]   time in your
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:45.840]   New York
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.200]   time
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.640]   although you
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:47.800]   reach
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.260]   six hours
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.540]   back
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.040]   six hours
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.340]   it's 2 a.m
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.580]   so when you land
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.000]   Italy
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.640]   you want to
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.500]   avoid light
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.380]   like the plague
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.080]   yeah you could
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.440]   eat
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.260]   but you really
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:56.720]   don't want to
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.160]   get a light
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.720]   because otherwise
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.220]   it's going to
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:58.460]   delay
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.540]   it's going to
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.000]   send you to
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.540]   California
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.040]   instead of
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.660]   sending you to
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:01.960]   Italy
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.660]   what Sam
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.000]   is saying
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.460]   is so
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:03.920]   crucial
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.600]   just because
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.520]   getting bright
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.000]   light in your
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.660]   eyes early
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.120]   in the day
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.560]   is really
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.980]   beneficial
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.360]   when you're
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   at home
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.340]   when you travel
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.760]   to a new
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.340]   time zone
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.200]   you have to
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.560]   take into
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.460]   account where
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:13.960]   your body
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.460]   thinks you
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:14.660]   are
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.100]   and so if
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.460]   you're looking
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:15.720]   at the
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.080]   Italian
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.560]   sunrise
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.400]   having just
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.940]   flown from
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.260]   New York
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:18.680]   to Italy
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.360]   and you
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:19.620]   didn't
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.200]   prepare for
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.620]   that trip
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.060]   by waking
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.480]   up a little
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:21.920]   bit earlier
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.700]   in anticipation
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.560]   multiple days
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.060]   and you view
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.560]   light at
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.040]   2 a
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.900]   excuse me
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.880]   at 6 or
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.560]   7 a.m
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.760]   Italian time
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.120]   beautiful
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.080]   Italian sunrise
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.160]   you are going
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   to delay
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.240]   your clock
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:32.640]   you're going
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.140]   to basically
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.020]   throw yourself
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.580]   back to
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.060]   California
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.580]   but you are
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.000]   in Italy
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.660]   you're going
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:36.880]   to throw
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.540]   your biology
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:37.980]   back to
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.320]   California
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.740]   and you
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:38.960]   are going
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.200]   to be
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.680]   up in
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.040]   the middle
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.300]   of the
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.640]   Italian
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.000]   night
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.660]   and you're
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:41.740]   going
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:41.880]   to be
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.720]   miserable
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.280]   miserable
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.040]   it's
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.400]   very
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.020]   important
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.540]   to avoid
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.420]   getting the
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:47.860]   wrong light
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.400]   information
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.840]   when you're
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.260]   trying to
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:49.620]   adjust
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.080]   your body
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.460]   because
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.140]   otherwise
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.660]   it shifts
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.080]   you to the
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.300]   other side
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.960]   absolutely
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.440]   right
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.360]   you are
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   one of
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.100]   these people
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.780]   that has
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.460]   such vigor
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.100]   I think
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.440]   a lot
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.720]   of your
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.040]   ability
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.540]   to work
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:24:59.880]   hard
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.460]   and focus
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:00.900]   and really
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.460]   do so
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:01.740]   many
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.300]   things
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:02.680]   at an
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:02.980]   impressive
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.400]   level
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.260]   is because
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.660]   you think
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.100]   about these
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.400]   issues
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.860]   and you
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.800]   think about
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.320]   when you're
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.840]   going to be
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.340]   optimal
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.180]   for focus
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.660]   when you're
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.020]   going to be
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.340]   optimal
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.060]   for exercise
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.180]   and the
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:12.800]   when is
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.240]   the key
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.540]   and I think
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:14.940]   a lot of
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.440]   people live
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:15.680]   in the
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.020]   landscape
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.560]   of feeling
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:16.780]   like
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.000]   there's
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.260]   something
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.700]   broken
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.200]   inside
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.520]   them
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.480]   I really
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:19.920]   agree
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.260]   with you
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.640]   that I
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:20.800]   think
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.240]   part of
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.580]   the reason
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:21.900]   I'm
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.300]   continuing
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.780]   to be
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.080]   able
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.460]   to do
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:23.700]   this
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:23.960]   that
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.700]   I
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.000]   really
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.300]   think
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:25.620]   about
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:25.820]   it
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.120]   and I
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.760]   make sure
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.380]   that I
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:27.720]   keep
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.300]   everything
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.940]   aligned
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.980]   and that
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.780]   actually helps
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.280]   me a lot
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:31.740]   like I
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.940]   don't suffer
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.540]   in sleep
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.240]   I don't suffer
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.840]   in waking up
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.380]   I never
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.120]   use a timer
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   to wake up
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.540]   system
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.840]   is so aligned
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.580]   it works
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.800]   a lot
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.400]   a lot
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   a lot
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.760]   of times
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.060]   people
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:41.500]   will say
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:41.920]   how come
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.200]   I go
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   to sleep
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.000]   I fall
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.300]   asleep
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:43.680]   fine
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.060]   but then
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.420]   I wake
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:44.640]   up at
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:44.920]   three or
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.160]   four in
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.460]   the morning
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:45.900]   and can't
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.320]   fall back
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.660]   asleep
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.440]   is it
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:47.840]   possible
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.280]   that those
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.740]   people were
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.220]   supposed to
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:49.600]   go to bed
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.240]   at 8pm
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:50.960]   yeah I mean
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.720]   it is possible
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.080]   or it's possible
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.960]   that their clock
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.640]   is completely
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.240]   misaligned
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.180]   that they are
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:56.940]   getting maybe
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.740]   enough time
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.220]   at night
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:58.680]   when they are
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:58.920]   supposed
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.400]   and then they
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.040]   possibly feel
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.660]   so sleepy
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.160]   in the day
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.580]   so there
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.240]   all these
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.800]   are possible
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.460]   combinations
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.020]   that's an
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.560]   interesting idea
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.240]   and considered
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:05.820]   so I mean
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.360]   that what they
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:06.960]   think is their
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.380]   sleep
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.020]   their body
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.760]   is so out
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.280]   of whack
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:09.580]   with the
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:09.940]   light dark
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.220]   cycle
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.640]   that it's
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.240]   actually a
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.380]   nap
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.500]   or the
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.860]   weaker
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.400]   part of
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.800]   the sleep
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.100]   I mean
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.500]   you see
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.080]   this in
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.140]   when you
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.660]   travel to
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:16.920]   different
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.360]   time zone
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:17.880]   before you
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.400]   adjust
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.720]   you go to
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.020]   sleep
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.640]   really well
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.060]   but two
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.660]   hours later
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.040]   you're
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.680]   fully up
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.700]   two hours
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.580]   if you were
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.200]   so tired
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.620]   and this
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:25.900]   is your
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.200]   regular
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.560]   sleep
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:26.880]   there's
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.460]   no way
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.040]   you're
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:28.180]   going to
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.560]   wake up
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:28.920]   in two
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.320]   hours
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:29.960]   let's
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.380]   talk about
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.160]   seasonality
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.500]   a little
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.760]   bit
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.600]   are there
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:32.920]   other
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.640]   effects
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:33.840]   of
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.460]   seasonality
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:34.940]   on humans
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.240]   that we
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:35.660]   are aware
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.120]   of
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.500]   honestly
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:36.820]   you could
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.220]   see it
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:37.700]   perfectly
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.320]   I think
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:38.860]   in
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.320]   in
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.000]   Scandinavia
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.300]   I mean
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:40.680]   you could
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.180]   talk to
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.520]   people
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.480]   who live
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.780]   in
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.260]   sure
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.660]   they get
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.120]   seasonal
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.620]   depression
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.100]   what
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.560]   seasonal
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:45.940]   depression
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.360]   is one
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.840]   but actually
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.120]   when you
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.420]   start
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:47.840]   asking
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.080]   them
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.560]   questions
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.200]   they tell
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.340]   you
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:49.560]   like
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.940]   in the
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.260]   winter
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:50.540]   they
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.040]   barely
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.320]   could
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.640]   wake
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:51.960]   up
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.540]   they
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.020]   barely
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.360]   have
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:53.540]   the
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:53.860]   energy
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.280]   before
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:54.580]   even
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.060]   depression
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.520]   even
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:55.820]   people
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.000]   who
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.180]   don't
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.360]   get
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.720]   seasonal
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.200]   depression
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.920]   they'll
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.200]   tell you
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.460]   our
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:58.960]   energy
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.280]   level
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.740]   is lower
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.080]   our
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.560]   ability
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:00.880]   to go
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.360]   to work
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.520]   is not
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.000]   the same
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.320]   and in
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:03.880]   the summer
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.260]   most people
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:05.980]   actually sleep
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:06.580]   very little
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.120]   they tell
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.480]   you we
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.600]   really can
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.120]   we feel
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.600]   like we're
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:10.880]   manic
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.320]   we have
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:11.720]   all this
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.340]   energy
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.420]   and not
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:13.680]   in a
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:13.960]   negative
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.380]   way
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:14.660]   in a
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:14.840]   funny
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.040]   way
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.360]   right
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   I mean
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.400]   but if
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:16.640]   you want
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.940]   to sleep
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.260]   we have
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:17.560]   to put
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:17.840]   this
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.200]   curtain
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   I think
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.720]   in these
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.480]   situations
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.320]   you could
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:21.840]   really
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.600]   appreciate
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   the seasonality
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.180]   of humans
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.740]   I think
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.600]   we kind
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:25.740]   of
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.260]   destroyed
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:26.560]   our
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.300]   seasonality
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.900]   because we
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.560]   don't get
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.120]   exposed
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.500]   to that
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.800]   much
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.220]   natural
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:31.480]   light
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:31.820]   we have
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.280]   all this
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:32.680]   artificial
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.120]   light
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.480]   but I
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:33.880]   think
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.360]   honestly
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.380]   one of
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:35.720]   the things
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.280]   that is
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:36.580]   going to
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:36.900]   happen
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.500]   if they
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:37.860]   follow
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.080]   your
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.600]   recommendation
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.400]   this is
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:39.700]   going to
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:39.960]   cause
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.320]   them to
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.700]   also
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.600]   experience
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:41.900]   some
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.420]   changes
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:42.760]   across
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:42.980]   the
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.260]   season
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:43.620]   because
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.160]   now
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.140]   they're
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.280]   going to
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:45.420]   see
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.620]   the
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:45.820]   sun
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.420]   differently
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:46.800]   if
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.100]   you're
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.260]   going to
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:47.760]   go out
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.080]   in the
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.460]   morning
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.440]   in the
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:49.720]   summer
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.040]   you're
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.160]   going to
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.340]   get
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.780]   much
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.100]   bright
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.380]   that's
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:51.600]   why I
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:51.740]   don't
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:51.940]   like
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.100]   the
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.380]   change
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:52.560]   in
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:52.820]   time
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:52.980]   I
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.240]   know
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.060]   people
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.320]   think
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:54.500]   oh
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:54.800]   because
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.060]   you're
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.520]   biased
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.860]   you
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.480]   because
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.660]   I
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:56.880]   think
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.120]   wait
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.420]   wait
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.000]   sorry
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.240]   the
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.460]   change
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.580]   time
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:58.700]   you're
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:58.860]   talking
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.020]   about
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:27:59.340]   daylight
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:27:59.780]   savings
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.100]   daylight
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.540]   saving
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.160]   it's such
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.520]   a bad
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.040]   idea
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.460]   because
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.420]   it disrupts
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.100]   that rhythm
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.760]   that you're
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.160]   having
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.240]   because I
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.460]   think
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.000]   your body
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.880]   if you
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.140]   keep
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.360]   that
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.620]   rhythm
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.000]   you will
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.200]   see
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.400]   the
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:09.640]   whole
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.360]   seasonality
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:10.780]   and I
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.320]   look at
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:11.660]   it from
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.160]   a different
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.580]   aspect
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.820]   than
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.080]   other
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.420]   people
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.020]   if
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.140]   you
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.380]   think
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:14.680]   about
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:14.900]   it
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.440]   there
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:15.600]   is
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:15.780]   a
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.400]   situation
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:16.960]   where
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.560]   you're
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   getting
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.140]   light
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:18.680]   perfectly
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:18.940]   well
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.140]   and
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.300]   then
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:19.540]   all
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:19.660]   of
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:19.840]   sudden
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.000]   they
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.280]   delay
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.420]   it
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:20.580]   by
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.820]   one
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.120]   hour
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.480]   because

[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.260]   it's
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.560]   not
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:43.860]   just

[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:44.760]   right
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.360]   because

[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:47.420]   day
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:47.640]   but
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:47.880]   there's
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.060]   this

[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.460]   three
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:51.900]   elements
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.120]   of

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.040]   so
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.520]   close
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:58.820]   it's
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.180]   sometimes
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.620]   hard

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:01.880]   it
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.400]   perfectly
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:02.840]   because
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.760]   we're

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.080]   and
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.260]   then
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.420]   you

[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.020]   know
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.220]   so
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.460]   it
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:08.900]   just
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.280]   it

[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.120]   think
