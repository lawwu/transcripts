[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   I think about this whole thing of like deaths of despair and, you know, not long ago you
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.040]   were talking about group selection.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.720]   I feel like these two themes might be related.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.900]   I feel like right now politically and culturally in this country, and now starting in Europe
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.720]   as well, it really is, it has become an us versus them kind of scenario.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.840]   There doesn't seem to be a middle at all, it's like a big trough.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.420]   And even the suggestion that somebody could kind of switch between groups is kind of like
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.480]   a no, because they believe and have said and done this, no, because they believe and have
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.860]   said and done this, and very strong opinions from both sides.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.880]   So I don't think we're in a just hug it out kind of landscape right now.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.320]   And so I'm curious what forms of non-physical affiliative behavior exist out there.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.840]   There are social media accounts out there, like Upworthy, which, you know, just consistently
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.160]   puts out positive content.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320]   There are people who are very positive in their, you know, in their online behavior,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.200]   and there's encouragement, it exists online, but it seems to be swamped by these like high
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.740]   salience like attacks, like what's the deal?
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.740]   What can we do?
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.640]   Yeah, I mean, this is a fundamental question for our age, I think, and we're on a trajectory
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.380]   toward, well, I mean, I don't want to give the impression that I'm a complete pessimist,
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.960]   but I could, I was about to say toward oblivion, between like, the despair that has been driving
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:45.840]   people to either commit suicide, or to, you know, develop severe mental illness, or physical
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.560]   health issues, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc., that are, I think, a consequence of
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.600]   being, in some cases, a consequence of being isolated because you are not interacting.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920]   That's part of who we are as a species, and we don't thrive.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.260]   I mean, the work is very clear that like, being isolated, being alone is worse for your
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.360]   health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760]   I mean, it's just really, really bad, and it scales, it's almost linear to how many
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.280]   contacts you have, you know, per week, or per month.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.400]   So that's all really bad, and I do believe that's also driving, that's a big driver
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.120]   for, not just the deaths of despair, but like, the lack of coupling, and the lack, you know,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.320]   and crashing rates of fertility, which is also a real thing, and it is happening, and
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.840]   if we don't counter it, it's going to be bad.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.000]   Getting back to synchrony, one of the most effective ways to get in sync with somebody
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.840]   that you're out of sync with, or that you don't know, right, who's different from
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.400]   you, is through conversation, but deep conversation, okay, and there's a couple parts to this.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.840]   You have to make the time and the space to do this, you have to have an intentional mindset,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.120]   and we and other scientists have worked with, there are these structured sets of questions
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   that have been developed.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.400]   There's one called Fast Friends, developed by the Arons in the late 1990s, there's commercially
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   available decks online that you can get.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.240]   And they're cool because they, each question, you know, you can kind of take it at a superficial
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.900]   level or a deep level, but they're designed to kind of like, break the ice, and then get
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.360]   you really fast into like really deep questions.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   Is this like 100 questions to fall in love type thing that was published in the New York
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   Times?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   Yeah, it's very similar to that, but in this case it's about connecting, like deep connection.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   I think it's more about deep connection than sort of romance part of this, and what happens
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.780]   during that, and my good friend and colleague Emily Falk at the Annenberg School had a really
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.000]   nice paper recently that showed that by measuring brain activity itself in people who don't
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.480]   know each other, as they work through these questions, and their brain, you know, one
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.980]   brain is in this space, another brain is in this space, and they over time come into really
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.120]   close alignment, and that's associated with all this good stuff.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.560]   Like I like you more, I feel closer to you, I value you more, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.920]   And once you're in that kind of alignment, now you're set to sort of do things together.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.120]   And now I think that gets back to your question, like, we can't hug it out, but we have to
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   somehow create space, and when I say space, like give people the space to do that.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.720]   Like I'm going to talk to, you know, somebody from the other political party or from the
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.520]   whatever, that's not a bad thing, right?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.640]   In fact, that's what we need to do, but instead we're, especially online, reinforcing and
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.800]   making the barriers harder to have those conversations, which are the necessary thing, I think, to
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.960]   establish the glue that keeps us together.
