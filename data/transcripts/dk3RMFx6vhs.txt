[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.120]   found in the first epistle of Peter in the second chapter and reading verses 9
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.680]   and 10 verses 9 and 10 in the second chapter of the first epistle of Peter
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.240]   but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation a peculiar
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.600]   people that he should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:43.160]   of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.760]   are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.360]   mercy now those who attend here regularly will know that we are coming
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.720]   back to this portion of scripture for the fifth time and when I say portion of
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.280]   scripture I'm not referring only to these ninth and tenth verses in this
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.000]   second chapter of the first epistle of Peter but I'm referring to the first 12
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.440]   verses in this chapter for here the Apostle diverts the entire paragraph to
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.760]   the consideration of one central theme and the theme is the one that is put to
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.000]   us in such a wonderful way in the sixth verse where he says wherefore also it is
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.340]   contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone elect
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.520]   precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded now that's that's
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.640]   the subject that is the great question the problem and let me put it in another
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.400]   way can be put like this that the great quest that is in various ways engaging
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.880]   the attention of men and women in this world at this hour is just this quest
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.320]   for some teaching some place some position which will so protect us and so
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.080]   give us assurance that we shall never be confounded never was this more urgently
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.880]   needed than at the present time with everything in life so uncertain nothing
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.640]   is stable the Apostle goes on to remind these people to whom he was writing that
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   they're but strangers and pilgrims in this world and that's true of all of us
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.040]   we are journeymen we just pass through life but even life itself now it has
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.600]   become visibly and evidently utterly uncertain who knows what tomorrow may
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   bring for I'm not thinking only of the international situation I'm thinking of
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.440]   the whole character of life with diseases and pestilences isn't this an
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.240]   extraordinary thing hasn't it made you think my friends there was a time when
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.040]   we thought we'd finished with smallpox science and conquered it vaccination no
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.080]   more smallpox but you see it's come back again and so it is with life just when
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.680]   men is on the point of congratulating himself that he's read himself of this
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.200]   problem or that it either comes back on another one arises and he finds himself
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.120]   in the same perplexity the same difficulty and the same uncertainty as
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   he was in before and so I say the great problem the thing that everybody would
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.880]   like to know of is this is it possible in this world and in this life to be in a
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:02.200]   position in which we shall never be confounded never disappointed never put
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.960]   to shame never bewildered never frantic but always in a position in which we
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:17.480]   know a rest and a peace of mind and of heart and of spirit now that's the great
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.360]   question and according to the teaching of this Bible this book everywhere from
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.080]   beginning to end there is only one way in which we can ever arrive at that
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.560]   position of rest and of quiet now this is something that has been engaging the
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.000]   attention of men of course many times before we remember that famous statement
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.260]   of the great saint Augustine brilliant philosopher brilliant thinker yet an
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.640]   unhappy man defeated by a moral problem in his life his philosophy couldn't
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.840]   satisfy him there was no answer there and after much troubling and seeking and
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   searching and argumentation he came to this conclusion here it is thou has made
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:12.240]   us for thyself and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.200]   thee that's just another way of saying he that believeth on him shall not be
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.840]   confounded very well what I'm putting to you is this we've examined the other
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   theories the other views the other proposals that are put before us and we
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   see that in every case they simply disappoint they can't find this place of
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.360]   rest there's no philosophy known to men no teaching that can guarantee that a
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   man will never be disappointed never taken by surprise never let down there's
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.640]   no such thing the world has been seeking for it from the beginning of
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.760]   civilization it can't find it it can never face life itself leave alone death
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.440]   and what lies beyond death so we come to this there's only one way and it's God's
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   way that's what the apostle is saying here I will lay in Zion a chief
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.080]   cornerstone that's God speaking and this is the message of the Bible that the
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.120]   only way to find this place of rest and safety is to listen to the message of
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.720]   God it's in this book that's why we preach from this book this is our only
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.320]   textbook we haven't another this is a loan God's revelation all the others are
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.000]   the theories of men here is alone the truth as it comes from God graciously
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   revealed and given and recorded by men under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.800]   God very well what is it well it's in this it isn't this isn't it that God
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.840]   gives us this peace this rest this tranquility this assurance in and through
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:57.680]   his only begotten Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ behold I lay in
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.760]   Zion the chief cornerstone elect precious yes the preciousness of the Son
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.120]   of God this is God's way of salvation here's the message of the entire book
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.000]   this is essential Christianity that God so loved the world that he gave his only
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.960]   begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.880]   everlasting life it's all in our relationship to this Son of God our Lord
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   and Savior Jesus Christ who puts us into this blessed position of never being
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.320]   confounded by not only living a perfect life in this world but by dying for us
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.380]   and our sins his body was broken his blood was shed hence this communion
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.280]   table and rising again to justify us and there he is seated at the right hand of
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.720]   God waiting until all his enemies shall be made his footstool that's the place
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.280]   of safety to believe that and to commit yourself to that but and here's the
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:08.000]   problem music our very scripture itself tells us that when he came into this
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.080]   world he was rejected of men whom coming as into a living stone disallowed indeed
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.840]   of men but chosen of God and precious and again you remember the repetition
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.720]   unto you therefore which believe on him he is precious but unto them which be
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.400]   disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.000]   the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even unto them which
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed now
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.600]   we saw that last Sunday night but here is the greatest tragedy in the world
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.760]   tonight that while there is possible for us this place of rest this position on
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   this foundation on which we'll never be confounded men rejected and rejected with
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.080]   sarcasm and scorn and utter derision they dismiss the whole thing as being
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.120]   folly and nonsense and they regard it as ridiculous to be still talking about
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.240]   this and believing this in the mid 20th century now there's the position which
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.520]   we find he's always divided the human race those who believe in him and those
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.040]   who don't and it's still the same now then here I say is the great question
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.200]   and my dear friend that's why I'm preaching at all I know that this is the
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   only place where a man can ever find rest but I see the majority of people
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:44.080]   rejecting him and continuing in their dis-ease their unrest their unhappiness
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.920]   and all that is so true of life today what's the matter with them well we had
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.520]   a part of the answer again last Sunday night if this pride builders it's
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   because they think they know and we saw how they don't know they've been proved
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:09.240]   to be wrong the wise and the prudent the princes of this world rejected this son
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.200]   of God when he was here they laughed at him they ridiculed him they said who is
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.440]   this fellow how at this man learning never having learned they said away with
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.200]   him crucify him and they did crucify him and they thought they'd finished with
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.620]   him but they hadn't the stone which the builders rejected the same is made the
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.200]   head of the corner he rose death couldn't hold him he's conquered
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.600]   everything he's risen triumphantly and there he is in the glory but in spite of
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   it of this being historical fact men and women still rejected why do they do so
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:55.480]   now that's the question what is this fatal something in the human race that
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:02.160]   makes it reject its greatest benefactor what is it about men that makes him spit
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.360]   into the face of God incarnate what is it about men I say that makes him refuse
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:17.400]   the one thing he needs the place in which he will never be confounded well
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.680]   the father answer is given in these verses that I read to you just now these
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.040]   verses 9 and 10 and that's why I'm calling your attention to them what's
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.600]   the matter I ask and the answer given here as it's given everywhere in the
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.640]   Bible is this that man's fundamental problem is his failure to know the truth
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.960]   about himself that's why he can't diagnose his problem he doesn't
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.760]   understand himself he's always looking outside at something else or somebody
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.200]   else that's not the way to solve your problem start with yourself and it's
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.840]   because men doesn't know himself he's wrong everywhere some as I'm going to
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.120]   show you have got two optimistic views about men other others have two
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.000]   pessimistic views about men but they're equally wrong because they're not the
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.160]   right view of men now that what is the right view of men well the great message
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:19.240]   of the Bible is that man only truly knows and understands himself when he
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:26.520]   considers himself in the light of God and in his relationship to God now let
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.200]   me show you how that is put before us here that's the very theme that the
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.440]   puzzle elaborates before us and it's important for this reason that there is
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:42.400]   no hope whatsoever for any individual until he grasps this truth none at all
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.360]   now that's a sweeping statement says someone well it is but it happens to be
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.240]   a statement that demonstrates itself if you can show me any men who have solved
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.640]   the problem of men and of life and of living and of death apart from this I'll
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.000]   withdraw my statement but you can't do that as I've reminded you the
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.200]   philosophers and the philosophies of the centuries have completely failed to do
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.400]   this they are as bewildered tonight as they've ever been it's no use talking
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.200]   about the great advance in knowledge there is no advance in knowledge at this
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.400]   point none at all all you know about the atom tonight that wasn't done a hundred
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.920]   years ago doesn't make the slightest difference to how you and I live day by
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.800]   day and as to how the whole world of men lives don't our newspapers prove this
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:39.280]   you see this is the fatal gap that men cannot see that it is their trouble
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.820]   about themselves that leads to all their other troubles you'll never know in
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.320]   other words why men behaves as he does until you're writing your ideas to what
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.820]   men is and ought to be now then let's see what the apostle has got to tell us
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.260]   about it well what he tells us in the first place about men is this he says
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:04.620]   that men by nature in this world men as he is as the Bible puts it since the
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:15.320]   fall I say men as he is by nature is first of all in a state of darkness who
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:23.480]   hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light he says that's where you
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.400]   were he tells them three things about himself there themselves he says you
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.920]   were in darkness you've been brought out into light you were not a people in time
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.880]   past year now the people of God you have not obtained must now you have obtained
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.640]   mercy here it is he's contrasting these people now with what they once were in
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.280]   times past there you were now you're in a very different position they'd become
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   Christian now then let's see what he's got to say about them before they were
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.320]   Christians before they believed this message before they were established on
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:02.080]   this living stone this chief cornerstone which God has placed in Zion his only
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.640]   begotten beloved son and him crucified what were they like well they were in a
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.360]   state of darkness what does he mean by that I've called you out of darkness
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.240]   that's just a phrase of course a word for describing the condition of these
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:27.000]   people as they were in paganism lots of them were pagan some of them were Jews
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.800]   but it's equally true of all of them they were in a state of darkness but
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   what do you mean by that says someone well you know we still go on using these
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:45.880]   phrases don't we people talk about the heart of darkest Africa it was referred
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.360]   to as the dark continent at one time before the missionaries had gone there
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.960]   with the gospel and with education and hospitals and so on men general booth
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.080]   the founder of the Salvation Army he wrote a book and he put a very good
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:06.520]   title to it in darkest England now this is a phrase that is used to describe the
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.640]   state in the condition of people outside the knowledge of Christianity and it's a
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.000]   very good phrase darkness what does it mean well first and foremost let's look
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.660]   at it in this way let's first of it look at it in very general as it expresses
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.520]   itself and then let's go on to consider why it expresses itself in that way so
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:32.200]   first and foremost the term darkness is a term that describes a way of life a
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.680]   way of living the kind of manner in which people conduct and comport
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:45.720]   themselves darkness those of you know your Bibles will know that the Bible
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.880]   talks about the works of darkness the hidden works of darkness it says that
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.240]   Christians are children of the day everybody else are children of the night
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.480]   they that be drunk says the scripture be drunk in the night this is a
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.440]   characteristic of their life it's the hidden works of darkness the things that
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   belong to the night now we all know about that don't you read in the
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.520]   newspapers about nightclubs the nightlife of London things go on which
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.560]   wouldn't go on in the light of day the worst things the things that are almost
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.360]   unspeakable they go on in the night and a cover in the darkness think people
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.680]   creep about they think they're unobserved and unknown that's the
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.720]   characteristic of that type of life the nightlife of London Paris New York
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.120]   short and so on now what does it all mean what kind of a life is it well we
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.320]   are told something about it in this very section did you notice how the section
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:59.160]   begin wherefore says Peter laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:09.480]   and envy and all evil speakings that's a very perfect summary isn't it of the
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:16.000]   life of darkness the nightlife of the souls of men you know they are you see
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.160]   malice what's malice well we all know unfortunately what malice is it means
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:28.360]   thinking dark ugly unkind and cruel thoughts having an evil desire with
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:37.120]   respect to others the desire to do harm to the malice and all guile what's guile
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:44.680]   well it's pretence isn't it pretending that you're something that you're not
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.840]   trying to weedle people trying to get something out of them and using all your
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:55.400]   cleverness and your subtlety and your ingenuity and all your knowledge guile
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.480]   you see the great thing we are told about that men Nathaniel is this here is
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.520]   an Israelite in whom is no guile that's the most unusual thing to be able to say
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.720]   about a man we're all full of guile by nature and then you go on to the next
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.000]   term hypocrisy what's that putting on a mask not being straight not being
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:25.120]   truthful deceiving not speaking the truth and then you come on to envy
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:32.960]   jealousy envy spite and malice coming out of it an ambitious person seeing
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.200]   another getting on hating him for it jealous of him for it he's got more than
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.600]   I have why should he have it and so you get warfare warfare in the spirit
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:48.360]   leading to actual fighting perhaps in some shape or form in and then evil
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.920]   speaking whispering about people have you heard this about sunset don't tell
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.480]   anybody I'm only telling you and you say that to everybody evil speakings
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.720]   spreading rumors about people damaging their character well says the apostle
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   look here you people you've become Christians now you must lay aside all
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.360]   that that's how you used to live that was your normal life and you thought
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.560]   there was nothing wrong in it you were living this life of darkness and that
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.720]   was the kind of life you lived now then there is a very perfect summary I say
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:24.000]   unfortunately about the kind of life that is being lived by people who are
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.040]   not Christians that is the truth about individuals that is the truth about
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   nations isn't that the thing that you see in life and in this world tonight
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:45.920]   full of guile full of malice full of hypocrisy full of envy full of evil
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.760]   speaking people don't trust one another they say it's no use doing so I've got
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.320]   to watch I can't believe husbands don't trust wives wives don't trust husbands
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.000]   there's this mask put on everything appears to be innocent you don't know
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.200]   what he's doing you don't know where he's come from isn't read your
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:13.760]   newspapers it's full of it in all ranks of society hypocrisy let me not waste
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.520]   your time in describing the envy and the evil speaking and the malice and the
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.920]   guile my dear friends this is true of the whole of life and it's not true of
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.640]   one section only you can get the malice and the guile and all the rest of it in
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   the ranks of the highest professions they're full of this sort of thing they
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.520]   cut one another's throats metaphorically if they could do so they'll bring a man
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.760]   down full of this envy and jealousy whispering damaging a man's character
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.840]   and reputation this is life the life of society it puts on a veneer of course
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.480]   look at them at their receptions butter wouldn't melt in their mouth they
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.200]   wouldn't how pleased they are to see so-and-so but look deeply into their
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.360]   eyes what are they whispering about them in their hearts what do they say when
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.520]   they meet the next person here's an analysis of life without Christ it's a
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.560]   sham a horrible sham it's the life of darkness it doesn't come straight it
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.280]   doesn't come true it doesn't come to the light it's always cloaking things
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:21.080]   hiding putting on masks unreal there it is but it's not only true of individuals
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.920]   isn't this the whole trouble in the world tonight why are they having this
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.200]   conference in Geneva and why are they failing in one conference after another
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.040]   what's the matter isn't it because there's malice isn't it because of this
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.880]   guile you don't know what a man means you know what he says but what's he
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.760]   mean and about the hypocrisy apparently all of them seeking peace every nation
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.000]   says it wants peace well what are they building the bombs for why are they
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.880]   preparing for war the trouble is you can't trust one another
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:00.440]   hypocrisy and envy one nation goes up there the other must get to the same
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.240]   point then this one must go and there they are higher and higher and higher
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.000]   and on and on and on it goes in the jealousy the haves and the have-nots
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.400]   the two sides of the curtain which is to be the greater power the whole world
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:21.160]   tonight is as it is because this is a life of darkness and the evil speakings
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.640]   that characterizes it all well now my friend here you see the Bible is not
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   only describing life as it was 2,000 years ago it's giving us a most perfect
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.800]   description of life as it is tonight this life outside Christ is always like
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.840]   this it's never been anything else it's more evident at some times than others
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.000]   and you and I unfortunately are living in an age and in a generation when all
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.480]   the foulness and the evil is unusually clear and plain if you want further
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.760]   descriptions of it all well they're to be found here you go home and read
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.680]   tonight the second half of the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:15.200]   and there you'll get it in all its dark reality you needn't read Lady Chatterley's
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.600]   lover to know what life is like without Christ the Bible's got it all quite
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:27.680]   plainly listen to this because that when they knew God they glorified him not as
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.480]   God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   foolish heart was darkened confessing themselves to be wise they became fools
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.920]   and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.120]   like to corruptible men and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.080]   wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.240]   own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.080]   of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:08.840]   Creator who is blessed forever for this cause God gave them up and to vile
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:15.720]   affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.480]   is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.360]   burned in lust toward one another men with men working that which is unseemly
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.240]   and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.640]   meek that's life of darkness there's the nightlife of the soul the life of men
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.280]   without Christ but that isn't all and even as they did not like to retain God
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.080]   in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.520]   which are not convenient listen being filled with all unrighteousness
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.440]   fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.280]   deceit malignity whisperers back biters haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.720]   inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.920]   do the same but have pleasure in them that do them and put them on your
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.320]   television screen as if it were wonderful and ridiculed Christianity the
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:31.940]   meanwhile that's it this state of darkness shows itself in the way in
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.680]   which people live that isn't life that's darkness that's the foul things
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.480]   groping about in the darkness and when the light comes scuttling out of sight
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:49.320]   into their wretched miserable home but unfortunately it doesn't stop merely at
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:55.800]   this kind of life which they live that inevitably leads to a kind of despair
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:03.400]   and hopelessness and you see when you're in the dark you're always hopeless you
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:10.100]   say I don't know I'm in the dark I can't see I must if I were a blind man I don't
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.520]   know where I'm going I'm trying to feel I'm trying to get hold of something to
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:21.760]   guide me darkness always leads to hopelessness that's why you know when
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.280]   you read the beginning of the coming of the gospel of Christ into this world
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.820]   you'll find the gospel according to St. Matthew quotes a very wonderful Old
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.120]   Testament text what was the thing that happened when Christ came into the world
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.520]   well here it is the people that sat in darkness have seen a great light and
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:46.040]   they sprang to their feet there they were sitting in darkness why well you
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:53.240]   see they'd given up in despair in utter hopelessness at first they said we're
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.520]   going to get out of this darkness is it there must be a way out so they began to
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   try and go along they thought they struck a pathway but they knocked their
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.760]   head against a rock they tried another another and knock in the head and on and
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.360]   on they go until at last weary and exhausted bleeding and saw they sat down
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:19.520]   in utter and complete and final hopelessness did you notice the way the
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.280]   Apostle Paul put all that in that second chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   he says you know you Ephesians before you came Christians you were like that
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.600]   strangers from the Commonwealth of Israel you were outside all God's
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:39.120]   covenants and then he goes on to say without hope without God in the world
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.760]   the final hopelessness and is always the same there is no hope apart from this
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.200]   our hymn writer puts it and he says men die in darkness at thy side without a
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.720]   hope to cheer the tomb and the world is full of such people tonight they don't
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.840]   understand they don't know what's it they say what can I do where can I turn
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.640]   they've got nothing absolutely nothing and if the worst comes they still have
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:15.760]   less men die in darkness at thy side without a hope to cheer the tomb what's
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.720]   it mean well you see it's this isn't it people living that sort of life and
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:28.080]   without understanding this here what's the good of anything what's the use of
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.320]   hoping they tell us to go on hoping what's the point we've been hoping so
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.600]   long mankind has been hoping so long here we are after all these centuries
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:43.560]   look at the world tonight what's the use of anything let us eat drink and be
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.960]   merry for tomorrow we die I believe there's a great deal of that today I
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:55.720]   think it accounts for most of our most serious moral problems I have a great
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.600]   sympathy with all young people today born into a world like this coming to an
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.480]   adolescent age what are they going to look forward to and you see they come to
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.040]   this conclusion what's the use of anything what's in it these fools our
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.680]   fathers and grandfathers they made a mess of our world look at these wars
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.120]   they've had they can't give us security there's nothing very well while we are
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   here let's have a thoroughly good time let's make the most of it that's their
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.520]   logic I'm not here to condemn them I'm sorry for them what they need is to hear
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.320]   this gospel you don't need more psychiatry it can't solve that problem
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.240]   you don't want better prisons that isn't the way there is one thing that can
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:40.880]   really show them there is a hope but it's this gospel and this alone and we're
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   offering them everything else because some of the great authorities themselves
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   don't believe this and yet they can't see that all they've got to offer is
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:56.760]   absolutely useless the hopelessness of the darkness like men groping in the
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.800]   darkness of noonday not seeing anything not knowing what to do nor where to turn
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:09.880]   and finally sitting down in a kind of final despair and defeat well there it
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.600]   is now then here is the most important aspect of this what's the cause of all
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.640]   this well that's the third thing about darkness it is the darkness you see of
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.600]   ignorance that's the trouble that's why people live like that that's why people
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:33.000]   are hopeless it is the darkness of ignorance as a man thinks so he does so
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   the explanation of the kind of life that is lived is the view they take of life
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.520]   is the thinking so the most important aspect of the darkness is to realize
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.840]   that it is always the darkness of ignorance now this is common parlance
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   isn't it common terminology people refer to the 18th century and particularly in
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:02.240]   France as the age of enlightenment you see at the time when people had their
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.160]   eyes open enlightenment in contradistinction to ignorance darkness
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.720]   means ignorance knowledge means light enlightenment but let's have a look at
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   this what is it then that man is ignorant of that he should live this
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   kind of terrible life described here and be in that utterly hopeless condition
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:34.240]   well here it is it's fundamentally and primarily an ignorance of God the world
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:40.960]   is as it is tonight because it doesn't know God because it's ignorant of God
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:47.640]   you see men instead of worshipping God are worshipping idols that's what they
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:53.120]   were doing in these ancient times that is what they're still doing
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.640]   worshipping dumb idols making gods for themselves in those days they used to do
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.880]   it out of wood or stone gold silver precious metals and then having made
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.200]   their gods they built a temple to them and then they'd bow down and worship
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   them and they take their offerings worshipping God idols gods of their own
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:21.560]   making and in the meantime ignoring the only true and living God and the world
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:28.600]   is still doing this look at the things men and women are worshipping still
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:43.320]   worshipping idols wealth possession gadgets cars sport entertainers I'm not
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.680]   exaggerating my friend this is idolatry do you see them by the thousands
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.040]   Saturday by Saturday they'll stop working in the week looking on living
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   for it getting excited spend their money on it forget their wives and children
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:03.000]   this this is idolatry this is what they live for they become wild about it and
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.120]   excited their mood that's idolatry and the world tonight is full of idolatry
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   why all simply because of this ignorance they don't know the God of heaven they
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   don't know the one who is over all the God who's made heaven and earth and the
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.560]   sea and all that in them is these things they've made and that they worshipped
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.920]   and do nothing God has made all things and holds all things together and is
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:39.120]   over all things and reigns over the whole universe they don't know about him
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.760]   and you see it is because the world doesn't know God and believe in him that
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.880]   it is as it is they set themselves up as God they worship themselves modern man
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.120]   is worshipping himself there's no question about it he ridicules religion
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.920]   he ridicules belief in God what well because he believes in himself he can
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.960]   handle his world he can manage everything there's nothing he can't do
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:09.800]   it's all because he doesn't know God when a man knows God is humble so he's
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.920]   in the dark and in the end in ignorance with respect to God but it's something
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.960]   else also and it follows of course because he's ignorant of God is
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:25.560]   ignorant about himself and as I said at the beginning in many ways this is the
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:31.040]   most crucial and urgent problem for us what is man I see no hope for the world
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:37.200]   until men finds out the truth about himself about man what is man now then
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.920]   there are some who say that man is just an animal oh they say people used to
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.080]   talk about a soul but Sir Arthur Keith the great anatomist said he dissected so
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.560]   many thousands of bodies he'd never found an organ called the soul out goes
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.720]   the soul what is men then well man is just an animal nothing else is just an
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:36:00.800]   animal like every other animal he may be a reasoning animal it may be that his
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.280]   cerebrum has developed a little bit more than that of other animals but he's
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.840]   nothing but an animal and therefore you see they say that because men's an animal
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.160]   is free to do as he likes as every animal obeys his instincts and his
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.560]   desires so should men and why shouldn't it why shouldn't it that's the argument
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.680]   why shouldn't I if I want that why shouldn't I have it if I like that well
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.040]   why do you say it's wrong that's a lot of old shibboleth that's all this
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.440]   nonsense of religion why surely a man is meant to express himself he's meant to
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.760]   allow these powers and propensities that are within him to manifest them what are
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.440]   they there for unless he's meant to use them it's all wrong to put men in a cage
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.320]   as if you were an animal no no let our man express himself that's their view of
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.280]   men and they're putting it into practice of course hence our moral muddle hence
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.800]   the problem for the magistrates and for the home office and all the problem of
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.600]   juvenile delinquency adolescence and all the rest of it it's all because men's
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.320]   regarded as an animal and nothing matters therefore doesn't matter very
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.440]   much what happens to us there are many who seem to me to be coming to that
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:11.840]   conclusion if we are only animals well right if we are killed what's it matter
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.720]   that's the end of it it seems there's a lot of trouble to get out of it let's
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.280]   get the maximum out of it while we're here then if it does come to an end well
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.600]   it's come to an end and there it tells that's their view of men you see and so
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.920]   you get an utter responsible irresponsible view of life people don't
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.760]   care just out for themselves and for the moment and it's pleasure and all sense
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.120]   of dignity and greatness and responsibility and importance are
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   entirely forgotten and banished out of sight now that's one view there are many
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.560]   others I mustn't keep you but there's another one the extreme opposite of this
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.680]   that's the only other one I mentioned it's this great intellectual view of men
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:56.200]   which says no no man is not simply an animal man after all has got this great
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.960]   power this great brain and you mustn't say do what you like enjoy yourself and
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.040]   doesn't matter very much what happens oh no this type of men man's capable of
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.440]   tremendous things he's capable of ordering a perfect world if he only used
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.640]   his brain and if he only put it into practice why he could get rid of all his
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.960]   problems so these people far from sitting down in despair they say we're
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.320]   full of optimism everything can be put right let's all join together and we'll
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.520]   put this right these fatal intellectualists who haven't realized
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.480]   that men in addition to being an intellect has got these instincts and
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.720]   desires they show it many of them in their own lives and yet they don't seem
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.800]   to realize it when they think as if men were pure intellect and could solve all
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.480]   his problems but they're both equally wrong because they both equally fail in
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:53.560]   practice what's the trouble well the trouble you see is this it's ignorance
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:02.440]   concerning the true nature of men what is men that's the question and men
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.480]   is a creature created by God and in the image of God he's got an animal part of
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.360]   him he's got a body it's no part of Christianity to decry the body or to
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.480]   play down the body the body is a part of men given by God yes but man isn't only
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:24.160]   body man isn't only instincts he's got something else he's got an awareness
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.680]   within him that he was meant for something better he's always been
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.240]   reaching out after it he can't get there but he feels it ought to there's
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   something there yes that's the soul in a sense linked to the animal but then he's
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.320]   aware of something else there's a need that the world can never satisfy what's
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.240]   the meaning of love what's the meaning or even of your idealism where do you
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.000]   get self-sacrifice from and all the beautiful and ennobling wherever they
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.680]   come from this is the soul of men in expression man is not merely a creature
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.360]   he doesn't merely belong to time Longfellow wasn't a Christian but he
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:09.760]   said this dust thou art of dust returnest was not spoken of the soul
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.960]   there is that in men which is imperishable and it goes on and he's
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.760]   meant for something bigger and higher life wasn't meant to be as it is
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   tonight this is what men in his folly makes of it it was meant to be great and
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.480]   mighty and magnificent and pure and holy man doesn't know the truth about himself
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.760]   and the result is that he's equally ignorant about the whole state of his
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:40.000]   world you see the whole essence of our modern problem is that people don't know
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.080]   why the world is as it is they say we don't understand this it's the most
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:51.680]   educated century that's ever been we've done away with so much ignorance with
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.280]   our schools and so on why is this century like this that's the problem and
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   they've literally got no answer they cannot understand it you see if you
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.160]   take the view that the one salvation is to educate men and develop his brain
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.800]   well then this ought to be the greatest century of all but it isn't it may be
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.560]   the last we may be on the very verge of the end the final catastrophe but apart
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.480]   from that I say look at your moral problem look at the breakdown of
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.320]   everything what's the matter they don't know why don't they know well because
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:27.640]   they're ignorant not only concerning God and concerning the true nature and
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:34.280]   being of men they're ignorant of history they're ignorant of what has been
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.880]   happening in this world they're ignorant of the forces that are at the back of
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.800]   all our troubles and that ultimately cause our troubles did you notice how
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:53.480]   Paul put it in whom we all had our conversation in times past he says how
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   did we walk according to the course of this world according to the Prince of
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.720]   the power of the air the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:10.560]   why is life as it is what's the matter with men why do all our international
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.800]   conferences fail why are the nation's building up for the final kind of
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.920]   catastrophe what's the matter why doesn't men live by common sense why
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   won't he use his mind and put it into practice why don't the nation see the
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.080]   folly of what they're doing and scrap all their bombs and everything and
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:34.680]   really settle down to make a good world why won't they do it they won't do it
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   today they've been refusing throughout the century all our great optimistic
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.840]   hopes about a League of Nations and so on they've all fallen in ruins why what's
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.040]   the matter and you see it's because they're ignorant of this they can't deal
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:56.920]   with it there's only one answer man is being governed and controlled by a power
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:09.000]   greater than himself the devil there are unseen spiritual forces and man is the
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.320]   victim of these the problem is not only in men's own nature that's part of it
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.680]   the lusts the desires and all the rest of it but beyond that there is this
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:24.880]   malign evil power the devil his principalities and powers and they have
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.200]   but one object and that is to ruin God's world ever to produce chaos and
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.600]   confusion and unhappiness and they influence the minds of men and they
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:41.040]   manipulate them they control them that's the teaching and it's the only adequate
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:49.240]   explanation of history there is nothing else that can explain this fatal thing
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.640]   that dogs the highest and the best efforts of men this is the only
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   explanation of why when we think we're on the verge of the new age and the new
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.440]   world it all is smashed before our eyes but you say no it's just this evil men
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.280]   or that evil men but I ask you what makes him the evil men he is and why do
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   they arise like this constantly there's only one adequate explanation there are
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:20.360]   unseen spiritual forces fighting against men and his best influence that's the
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.000]   teaching which we have in this book but man is ignorant of that he doesn't know
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.120]   what's the matter with himself he doesn't realize he's the victim of these
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.680]   unseen powers he prides himself on the life he's living he calls it
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.760]   emancipation but it's darkness with his malice and guile and hypocrisies and
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:45.680]   envies and evil speakings he says isn't life wonderful and he bursts about his
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:51.080]   events and yet shows in practice that he hasn't advanced at all he's the fool he
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.400]   is the dupe of the devil he's the slave of this unseen power here and here alone
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.960]   are you given the explanation nobody else knows this the world ridicules it
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.240]   laughs at it that's why it's in trouble that's why men reject Christ the devil
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.400]   doesn't want them to believe in Christ he hates him it was he who persuaded men
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.920]   to crucify him he tried to get him down himself he failed he used men they
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.160]   thought they'd succeeded in the cross but they hadn't the devil and here he is
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:24.200]   still militating against God's purposes with respect to men and the world there's
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:32.800]   the darkness the darkness of ignorance I mustn't keep you my dear friends but
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:39.320]   that's what the Apostle tells us called you out of darkness but not only that
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.640]   they were not a people either that means that they were a kind of rabble God
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:51.720]   wasn't interested in them God didn't take care of them God didn't bless them
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.040]   and as Paul puts it there in that passage I read to you out of Romans 1
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.280]   God gave them up hands them over to themselves and I believe that's what's
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.200]   happening in the world tonight I'll tell you why the world is going down from bed
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   to worse why it's worse than it was 40 and 50 years ago morally and in all
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.040]   these respects I'll tell you why it isn't safe for a woman to walk about the
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.840]   streets of London any longer she doesn't know little boys suddenly disappear why
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.000]   what's the matter things used not to be like this what's gone wrong I'm giving
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:33.320]   you the answer to all this God because of men's cleverness and because men has
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.440]   turned to God and told him that he doesn't need him that he can manage his
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.840]   world without him because he now by passing acts of Parliament can bring a
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.160]   perfect world God is no longer necessary very well says God if you think you can
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.680]   do it have a shot of it that's what's happening God has abandoned the world
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.800]   for the time being to its own devices he is allowing it to reap the results of
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.320]   its own ideas and its own efforts and its own practice and conduct handed them
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.880]   over to a reprobate mind and you see what happens when you come to that
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.200]   perversions foulness indescribable they're not a people they're a rabble
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.000]   and God's not interested he's abandoning men and the world which they think they
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   can make perfect to their own devices here's the result of it not a people but
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.040]   still more serious than that had not obtained mercy what does that mean oh
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:37.920]   that means that they're under the wrath of God God hates with all the intensity
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:45.720]   of his holy and divine nature God is light and in him is no darkness at all
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.600]   and he abominates it is evil dark foul ugly don't you hate it when you look at
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:58.000]   it objectively guile and malice and hypocrisy and envy and all evil speaking
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.480]   and the kind of life people him is there anybody who'd like to defend it you
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   can't it's foul in itself it's ugly it's detestable oh what must it be to God
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:20.400]   and his wrath is upon it God doesn't bless men in sin he hates it his wrath
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   is upon it all had not obtained mercy we're outside God and all his gracious
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:32.280]   influences and benefits but the world doesn't know that doesn't believe in it
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.640]   and that's why it is as it is it is the darkness of utter ignorance about all
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.960]   these things but for me to close the final tragedy of course is this that the
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:54.680]   world is so ignorant of what the Apostle Paul's here is marvelous light have
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:02.120]   brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light what is this well this
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:07.040]   is all that's come in Jesus Christ that's what he's saying in this entire
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:18.160]   paragraph behold I lay in Zion the chief cornerstone elect precious he that
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:26.040]   believeth in him shall never be confounded into all this darkness God
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:34.560]   sent light yes says Paul God who commanded the light to shine out of
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.280]   darkness hath shined into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:49.080]   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ Christ said I am the light of the world
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:54.160]   he that cometh after me shall not walk in darkness he shall have the light of
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:04.200]   life marvelous light what is this oh how foolish to ask such a question at the
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.400]   end of a sermon I'm going to deal with this again God willing but I can't let

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.000]   isn't the thing that makes me speak of marvelous light what is it oh I look at
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:03.520]   Jesus Christ and I see the friend of publicans and sinners I see one with a
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.960]   heart of compassion I see one who says the whole people are like sheep without
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:15.320]   a shepherd I've come to save them the Son of Man has come to seek and to save
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:21.360]   that which is lost in Jesus Christ I come to know God as the God of glory
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.840]   everlasting yes but the God of love the God of mercy who had not obtained mercy
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:34.480]   but now have obtained mercy what's mercy mercy is this God's pity upon us
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:41.280]   in our wretched state of darkness and of sin and of hopelessness and despair Oh
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:47.000]   God look down over the ramparts of heaven at the world as men that made it
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.960]   and reduced it to the chaos and the misery and the shame and all the
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:59.360]   darkness and the foulness and God had pity upon it all that's mercy and in his
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:05.320]   love he sent his only son into this world that's the heart of the gospel the
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:10.480]   coming of Jesus Christ the Son of God what's he come for to save the world
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.760]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.040]   what marvelous light look at the baby in Bethlehem there's the Lord of glory all
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:26.240]   the light and the radiance of it all but wait a minute I'll tell you something
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:37.040]   much more marvelous than that that this holy eternal God who so hates him should
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:44.560]   send his only son into this world of sin that he should live here endure it all
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.120]   can you imagine what it was like to the Son of God the Lord of glory to live in
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.800]   a world that's full of malice and guile and hypocrisies and envies and evil
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:58.900]   speaking and to hear people whispering about him criticizing him some of them
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.320]   literally spitting into his face throwing stones at him putting a crown
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.360]   of thorns upon his holy brow what must it have meant to him but he came he
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.320]   endured it all more than that when he could have escaped so easily he
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:21.360]   deliberately went to the cross on Calvary's Hill what for to bear the
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   punishment that you and I so richly deserve the punishment of all the sin
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.200]   and the evil and the darkness and the foulness of our natural and regenerate
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.520]   hearts and lives he took it all upon himself Peter tells you that in the 24th
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.360]   verse of this very chapter we are looking at who is own self bear our sins
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:49.920]   in his own body on the tree why that we being dead to sin should live unto
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.840]   righteousness by whose stripes we are healed for ye were a sheep going astray
