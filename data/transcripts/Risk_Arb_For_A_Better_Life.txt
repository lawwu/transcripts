[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.680]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.360]   And in this episode, we're going to talk about risk arbitrage
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.760]   investing and why if we practice risk arbitrage or arbitrage
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.920]   in our lives, we can lead better lives going forward.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.080]   So risk arbitrage is an investment strategy
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.400]   that speculates on the successful completion
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.160]   of mergers and acquisitions.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.960]   This is the classic definition of risk arbitrage.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.020]   An investor that employs the strategy
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.720]   is known as an arbitrageur.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.660]   While risk arbitrage is a type of event-driven investing
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.520]   in that it attempts to exploit pricing inefficiencies caused
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.080]   by a corporate event.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.080]   So during my 13 years on Wall Street,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.560]   I covered hedge funds that deployed the risk arbitrage
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.800]   strategy.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.400]   And their bread and butter trade would be to go long a stock
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.040]   they thought would be a potential acquisition target
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.320]   and then go short either the company they thought
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.020]   would overpay or competitors that would
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.760]   be hurt from the acquisition.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.440]   Or maybe they would buy competitors
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.560]   who they thought would also get acquired.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.800]   There's a multi-combination of risk arbing going on.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   And here's a classic example.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   Suppose Financial Samurai is trading at $40 a share.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.560]   Then CNBC announces a plan to buy Financial Samurai,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.760]   in which case holders of Financial Samurai stock
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.360]   get $80 in cash.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.040]   Then Financial Samurai stock jumps to $70 a share.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520]   It doesn't go to $80 since there is some chance
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.960]   the deal will not go through.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.480]   The $10 spread is what an arbiter is playing for.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.280]   In this case, the arbiter can purchase shares
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.160]   of Financial Samurai stock for $70.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.120]   He will gain $10 if the deal is completed
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.800]   and lose $30 if the deal is terminated,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.720]   assuming the stock returns to its original $40 in a break,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.160]   which may not occur, which usually actually doesn't occur.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.920]   So according to the market, the probability
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.440]   that the deal is consummated at its original terms
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.320]   is about 75%.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.200]   That's what the studies have shown
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.040]   in any kind of mergers and acquisitions.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.600]   Once it's announced, 75% of the time, mergers happen.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   And the probability that the deal will be terminated
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   is therefore 25%.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.640]   So the arbiter has three choices.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.680]   Purchase Financial Samurai stock at $70.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.920]   He would do this if he believes the probability
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.640]   that the deal will close is higher than or in line
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.980]   with the odds offered by the market.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760]   Short Financial Samurai stock at $70.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.320]   She would do this if she believes the probability
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.460]   that the deal will be terminated is higher than the odds
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.400]   offered by the market, or simply not to get involved.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.000]   So that's an example of a risk arbitrage investment.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.720]   And the reality is you can practice this type
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.400]   of risk arbitrage investing in your life
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.320]   by identifying arbitrage opportunities.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.800]   For example, as an elementary schooler in Taipei, Taiwan,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.720]   I would buy Nerds Candy at the US Commissary for $0.25
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.640]   and then sell them for $0.50 to my classmates.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.160]   Does that sound good?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.480]   Well, it was 100% profit.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   Was that morally right?
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.120]   Well, I was able to make some money,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.760]   and actually all my classmates were happy
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.280]   because they would actually probably pay $0.75 or $1
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.320]   because Nerds Candy was the number one candy
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.040]   on campus at the time.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.520]   But eventually, other candy stores opened up
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.040]   and my profits were competed away.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.880]   Now, it wasn't just other stores that hurt my profits.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.320]   It was my classmates.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.440]   They were the ones who got smart and realized, hey,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.960]   if Sam can make some money, we too can make some money.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.480]   So every time my classmates went back to America
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.320]   during the summer vacations or winter vacations,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.840]   they would bring back lots and lots of other candy
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   and sell it to their classmates, who
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.160]   couldn't have the same opportunity going back
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.380]   to America.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.800]   And then what happened was inventory flooded the market,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.640]   and then again, profits were whittled away.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.520]   So if you are smart, you will be able to identify
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120]   what other people are doing and try
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.080]   to compete for that remaining profit as well
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.720]   until it disappears.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.960]   And then what you want to do is continuously look
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.760]   for new arbitrage opportunities.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.200]   So the current obvious no-brainer arbitrage
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   opportunity, in my opinion, is going long online savings rates.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   So online savings rates are paying higher
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.000]   than bricks and mortar savings rates
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.320]   because they have less overhead.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.000]   So a pure online bank, for example,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   like CIT Bank or Ally Bank or Synchrony Bank,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   all these banks have higher interest rates
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880]   than a Citi Bank or Wells Fargo and so forth
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.840]   because they have less overhead.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.280]   And therefore, they can pass on their cost savings
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.120]   to consumers.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   If you can get an online savings rate higher
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.000]   than the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.200]   bond yield, which is currently at about 1.55% to 1.75%
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.040]   at the end of 2019, that, to me, makes a ton, a ton of sense.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.760]   Back when the 10-year bond yield was at 3.21% in October 2018,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   one of the best online savings rate I could find
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.840]   was CIT Bank at 2.45%.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.880]   I track CIT Bank closely because they are not only
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   one of the best banks offering the highest rates,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.720]   but they are also an affiliate partner.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.560]   And I get all their updates via email.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   So 2.45% online savings rate back then
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.720]   was competitive because the yield curve was upward sloping.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.920]   Getting a higher risk-free rate would
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.640]   require owning a longer-term treasury bond until maturity.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.280]   The reward for locking up your money
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.360]   for 10 years in a treasury bond was therefore 3.21%--
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.480]   that's the 10-year treasury bond yield--
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.320]   minus 2.45% what you could get at an online bank.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.040]   So that reward was 0.76% a year.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.880]   And if you think about it, that is not that big of a reward.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.640]   To lock up your money to earn a guaranteed 0.76% a year
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.200]   for the next 10 years--
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.800]   not too enticing, but it is what it is.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.000]   Given the 10-year bond yield is now down to about 1.65%
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   since its 2018 peak at the time of this recording,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.520]   you would think that CIT Bank's savings rate
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.680]   would be down a similar amount.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.240]   In fact, that's not the case at all, because as we know,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.400]   the yield curve is kinked or inverted.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.480]   The latest savings rate for CIT Bank
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.120]   at the time of this podcast recording
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.920]   is 2.2%, a decline of only 0.25% since its 2018 peak.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.160]   Again, the 10-year bond yield declined by 1.65%.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.000]   In other words, 10-year treasury bond owners today
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.880]   are being negatively rewarded by 0.76%.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.160]   Not only is the online savings depositor now earning about 0.64%
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.720]   more than the 10-year treasury bond holder,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.520]   but there is also no lockup period and no risk up
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.880]   to the FDA-insured $250,000 per individual and $500,000
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   per couple.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.840]   I think this is one of the greatest risk-free arbitrage
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.000]   trades in modern financial history,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800]   because eventually, after CIT Bank and other banks
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.040]   providing a similar online interest rate
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.880]   have received enough inflows of deposits,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.440]   they will lower their interest rates,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.280]   and this opportunity will disappear.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.240]   Now, if you want to take on more risk
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   to potentially make more money, you
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.440]   can open up a high-interest savings account
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.280]   and then short long-term treasury bonds
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.800]   through an ETF like IEF.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.640]   The idea is to make money as rates go up
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.040]   on the 10-year or the long bond, because at 1.5%, 1.6%,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.400]   I would say the chances are greater than 50%
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.240]   that interest rates are going to take a little bit higher.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.840]   But again, who knows?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.520]   You're going to take that risk, and you've got to weigh the risk
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.320]   and reward yourself.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.440]   So let me share some more history
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.360]   of money-making arbitrage opportunities
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.480]   that went on in my life, and I think
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.960]   it'll be really pertinent for you in your life
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.800]   or your children's lives.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.120]   So one, I went to a public university
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.440]   for $2,800 a year in tuition.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.880]   I saw my older sister attend a private university
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   for $22,000 a year and saw no noticeable benefit.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   In fact, attending a private university
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.360]   was probably a detriment, because my parents
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.560]   didn't make that much money as government employees.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.320]   So the max arb here was going to one
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.080]   of the cheapest public universities
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.440]   and then getting a job in one of the most lucrative industries,
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.960]   which is finance.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   Even back in 1995, $2,800 a year sounded like a bargain,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.760]   because I could cover the tuition working at my $4
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.040]   an hour minimum wage job working at McDonald's.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.360]   And now, more than 20 years later,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.400]   it's funny to see that people still
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.200]   believe there's a positive spread in attending
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.800]   a much more expensive private university
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.920]   than a public university.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.080]   You heard about the college admissions scandals, where
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.680]   already very privileged and very wealthy people and parents
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.320]   are buying their kids' way into these schools that really
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.800]   mean nothing.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.680]   I don't want to denigrate private universities,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.000]   but I'm saying, unless you're already rich
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.680]   or you have huge scholarships, please do the right thing
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.240]   and save your money and go to the best public school possible
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.840]   or the best value school possible.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.800]   The reason why there's so much student loan debt,
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.100]   not only is because interest rates are higher than they
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.760]   should be, it's because parents and students aren't thinking
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.520]   about the ROI of going to school as much as they should.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.280]   They're seeing private school education, or maybe even
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.760]   college education as a whole, as some type of status symbol
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.320]   nowadays that's really, really not as necessary as it once
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.000]   was.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.320]   So please, be prudent in your higher education decision.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.400]   Two, buying property in San Francisco in 2003.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   I came to San Francisco with a raise and a promotion
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.840]   after two years in New York City.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.280]   At the time, the finance industry was thriving,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.820]   and I realized plenty of other people
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.280]   were making just as much money as people in New York City.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.240]   Yet San Francisco real estate was 30% cheaper on average
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   than New York City real estate.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.120]   This massive valuation discount was
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.960]   odd because I also found that the lifestyle in San Francisco
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.600]   to be much better.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.120]   The weather was pleasant year round, not just six or seven
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.280]   months a year.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.360]   The city was more beautiful and less stressful.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.880]   And after going snowboarding in two feet of powder
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.840]   on a Saturday in Lake Tahoe, three hours away,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.260]   and then playing tennis in 70 degree weather on a Sunday,
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.080]   I was sold.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.680]   It was a no-brainer to live and own in San Francisco.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.000]   And today, that price difference has basically
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.960]   narrowed or has gone away.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.200]   And now, it's not unheard of to hear reports
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.560]   that San Francisco real estate is now equal to or more
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.000]   expensive than New York City real estate.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.060]   Three, starting Financial Samurai in 2009.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.560]   After finishing up business school in 2006,
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.420]   it became more and more apparent that having
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.660]   an internet-based business with unlimited scale was the future.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.760]   I just didn't know what to start.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.200]   But when the financial crisis hit in 2009, I was like, OK,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.920]   let's start Financial Samurai and try
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.000]   to make sense of the chaos.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.080]   I didn't recognize at the time any personal finance sites
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.840]   written by someone who actually had a finance background.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.560]   This was really odd to me.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.360]   And so as someone who had 10 years of finance experience
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.200]   at the time, starting my own site seemed like an opportunity.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.480]   10 years later, in 2019, there are still
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.440]   very few personal finance sites that
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   are written by people with financial backgrounds
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.920]   for some reason.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.280]   Maybe the people in finance realize, you know what?
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.640]   It's much more lucrative to just continue to work in finance.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.400]   For me, I was burnt out, and money
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.320]   wasn't the big driver anymore.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.400]   I just wanted my freedom.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.600]   So hey, I thought this would be a good idea
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.080]   to do something new with something
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320]   that I'm quite familiar about.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.000]   Therefore, there are still opportunities
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   for finance industry folks to engineer their layoffs
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.920]   and start a finance website.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.240]   If you have experience in a field that
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.080]   is dominated by people without relevant experience,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.340]   it behooves you to fill that hole.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.520]   You must fill that hole, because that is
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.240]   massive arbitrage opportunity.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.760]   If you keep at it for a long enough period of time,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.920]   I'm positive you will enjoy incredible rewards.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.520]   Four, buying Panoramic Ocean View property in San Francisco.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.400]   To me, this is one of the biggest, biggest opportunities
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.040]   for real estate investors anywhere.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.680]   In no other major city in the world
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   do Panoramic Ocean View homes trade at a discount.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.920]   And I've been everywhere.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.260]   They all trade at hefty 30%, 100%, 200% premiums
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.000]   to the median price.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.320]   The discount has since narrowed from about 30% in 2014
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.640]   to about 15% in 2019.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.400]   But I still see plenty of opportunity
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.060]   to buy property with views on the western side of San
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.960]   Francisco.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.640]   San Francisco is one of the cheapest international cities
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.440]   in the world.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.840]   We have six-figure jobs that are a dime a dozen,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.960]   because there are so many massively profitable companies
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.960]   here that's just generating huge amounts of cash flow.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.000]   You know them all--
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.480]   Facebook, Apple, Google, et cetera.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.240]   It's just crazy how much you can make here
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   if you get one of those jobs.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.360]   Whereas if you look at places like Vancouver,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.400]   where the median price is quite similar to San Francisco,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   I don't know a single large international company that
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   will pay that much money.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.240]   I mean, can you name an international huge company out
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.360]   of Vancouver or out of Canada, for that matter?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   It's hard to name it.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.700]   And maybe it's because we're just dumb Americans.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.720]   But there is some valuation problems out there,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.360]   in my belief.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   By 2025, the discount window for San Francisco View-based homes
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   should narrow to 0%.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.120]   That's my opinion.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.600]   We're talking about a 240,000 arbitrage benefit
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.480]   based on the median priced home of 1.6 to 1.7 million.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.100]   In other words, 1.6 to 1.7 million times 15%
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.200]   is about 240,000.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.100]   And that's not considering any upswing in the real estate
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.840]   market by then.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.280]   And by 2030, Oceanview Homes in San Francisco
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.240]   should start trading at a premium,
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.360]   just like every single other international city
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.760]   in the world.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.320]   I encourage you to drive around all around your city
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.980]   one weekend and see if you can find some neighborhood gems.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.980]   I'm sure there will be places you will have never
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.440]   seen or heard of before that will blow your mind.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.560]   Five, investing in heartland real estate.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   Although there is a micro arbitrage opportunity
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.280]   to buy homes in SF with Oceanviews,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.440]   there's a macro arbitrage opportunity
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.920]   to buy real estate in the heartland of America,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.220]   mainly due to cost and technology.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.880]   Think about it.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.000]   If it really takes $343,000 in household income
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.840]   to buy a median priced $1.6 million home in San Francisco,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.080]   I don't know how many people are going to buy these homes
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.840]   or come to San Francisco.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.740]   And I think the San Francisco based companies
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.680]   are going to get squeezed.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.600]   I have a close friend who employs 4,000 people in San
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.320]   Francisco.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.240]   It's a publicly listed company.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.760]   And he constantly tells me it is impossible to be competitive
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.240]   because the guys like Google and Facebook and Apple,
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.320]   they're paying such big bucks that it's just causing wage
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.600]   inflation for the rest of us.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.280]   Speaking of Google, they announced in early 2019
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   it'll spend $13 billion to expand in Nevada, Ohio, Texas,
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.040]   and Nebraska.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.120]   Sounds like heartland real estate to me.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.800]   Meanwhile, Uber in late 2019 announced
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.480]   it has leased an office building in Dallas for 3,000 employees.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.960]   3,000 employees.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.740]   That's huge.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.320]   And if that goes well, they're probably
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.440]   going to continue to expand.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.160]   So the key really is to find the next San Francisco, Seattle,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.280]   New York City, and Washington DC.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.240]   It's only logical that thanks to technology also,
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.040]   people are just telecommuting more.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.080]   You don't have to live in a city center that costs--
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.200]   where a two bedroom costs like $4,500 a month
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   when you can live in a much lower cost area of the country.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.400]   So I believe there's going to be a multi-decade migration
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.760]   shift inland or simply to lower cost areas of the country.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.880]   And you need to find that arbitrage trade.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.840]   Finally, if you're a parent or you're a student,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.320]   there's another great arbitrage for Americans.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.800]   And that's to take advantage of the Canadians.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.520]   A top Canadian university has an acceptance rate
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.320]   of between 35% to 50%.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.760]   Literally half the people get in.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.560]   Whereas a top 10, top 20 university in America
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.640]   has an acceptance rate on average of 10% or below.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.760]   So that acceptance rate spread is huge.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.000]   It is really, really huge, folks.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.680]   So universities like UBC, McGill, University of Waterloo,
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.120]   if you don't want to kill yourself as a student
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.000]   or you want to hedge your bets when applying to college,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.320]   apply to the top Canadian universities.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.640]   Because once you get in, the reputation of these universities
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.520]   is pretty good.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.800]   They're pretty good.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.000]   And you're going to get the similar types of opportunities
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.360]   and jobs as you would if you went
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.280]   to a top American university.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.720]   And if you get Canadian residents,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.040]   the cost is 80% to 90% cheaper.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.920]   Now, international students have to pay much higher costs.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   But the costs are still about 10% to 20%
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.680]   cheaper than the most expensive private universities.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.240]   So hopefully you guys realize that after all these examples,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.880]   there are arbitrage opportunities every single day,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.360]   large and small.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.120]   Take some time out of your week and dedicate at least one hour
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.680]   to figure one out.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.720]   At the very least, everybody should take advantage
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.360]   of risk-free arbitrage opportunities,
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.960]   such as a higher online savings account with your excess cash.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.200]   My immediate focus now is paying attention
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   to the San Francisco real estate market, which
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   has softened in 2019.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.760]   And I think there's a great opportunity
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.680]   to buy before a wave of tech IPO liquidity
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.000]   gets unleashed at the end of 2019 and in early 2020.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.160]   I've spoken to dozens and dozens of employees
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.960]   from Uber, Lyft, Pinterest.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.280]   Some of them are happy.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.560]   And actually, a lot of them are kind of disappointed.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.440]   If you think about Uber in particular,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.560]   there were talks pre-IPO of $100 billion market cap valuation.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.080]   And right now, the stock is putting it
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.560]   at a valuation around $56 billion.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   So all those mental calculation models
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.640]   of thinking how rich you'd be after IPO,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.240]   has really got to be changed, because a lot of employees
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.520]   are much less wealthy than they think they are.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.080]   And they're disappointed.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.680]   And I want to go through this exercise and think,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.560]   what would I do if I was an Uber employee who
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.400]   thought I was going to be worth $3 million,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.640]   now I'm only worth, I don't know, $1 million, right?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.480]   While also taking a pay cut for four years.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.440]   And I think I'd probably diversify and sell
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.520]   a little bit in 2019, and then sell a little bit more in 2020
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.120]   to diversify my net worth, and also my tax liability.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.160]   So for everybody else in America,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.360]   I think there's a win of opportunity to buy property
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.800]   right now when rates are down, fears of recession are high,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.160]   and a flood of money will be looking for a more stable
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.400]   asset.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.760]   I hope everybody enjoyed this podcast.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.480]   It really has made me think about other opportunities
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.240]   instead of just being passive and sitting back and letting
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.000]   things come to me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.200]   Where I've gained the most amount of wealth
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.080]   is by taking action.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   So if you enjoyed this podcast, I hope to hear from you.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.000]   And please leave a positive review.
