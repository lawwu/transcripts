[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600]   We close out the week with an email
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.400]   from an anonymous listener, a young man,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.960]   who writes in to ask this, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.840]   I would consider myself addicted to the internet,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.960]   not to internet pornography, not to video games.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.600]   I'm addicted to email and Twitter and blogs,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.060]   and much of what I'm addicted to
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.600]   is solid gospel-centered content and articles
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.540]   that are genuinely interesting and thoughtful and edifying.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.760]   I think I may be overdoing it
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.260]   because my attention seems to be taken off the people
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.920]   around me and making a detrimental impact
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.660]   on my relationships.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.380]   Is this a problem?
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.380]   If so, how would you correct me?
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.060]   And what spiritual forces are at play in my heart?
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.320]   And do you have any strategies to help me with this?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.620]   My first thought when I hear that question
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.500]   is that I want to encourage us, I think,
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.180]   to almost suspend or at least minimize
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.720]   our use of the word addiction.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.380]   I don't mean there's no such thing,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.620]   but I think it would be helpful
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.620]   if we began to use some other more explicit sentences
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160]   or words, here's what I mean.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.680]   If I were this person, I would say, say this,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   I read Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news, or whatever
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.360]   to sinful excess.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.960]   Whatever the activity is, I should say,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.320]   I'm involved in this to sinful excess.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.280]   Secondly, let's say I am drawn to do this
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   with an intensity of desire that is out of proportion,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.480]   perhaps sinfully out of proportion
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   to the value of what I'm reading
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.120]   and the value of other things I may not be doing.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.260]   The desire is stronger than it ought to be
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.600]   for something, say, as inconsequential
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.320]   as Twitter and my desire for other things
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.880]   that may be more consequential is smaller.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   So I have a sinful disproportion of desire.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.460]   And the third thing I would want him to say or her,
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.320]   I should say, we should say,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.100]   I am regularly going against my best judgment.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.100]   And this is sinful in giving into an intensity of desire
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.660]   against my best judgment.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.260]   So talking about our compulsions in this way,
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260]   it seems to me, has the advantage
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.780]   of making some things clearer
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.940]   and being much more hopeful in our ability
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.840]   to address them in biblical ways.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.180]   It names the problem of sinful excess.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.580]   It names the problem of disproportion of desire.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.140]   It names the problem of contradicting
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.540]   our own best judgment.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.180]   It doesn't use this almost therapeutic
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.900]   or medical word of addiction
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   that kind of in a vague way covers all these specific sins.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.400]   So it's hard to deal with sin
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.220]   if it's cloaked with vague language.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.500]   So I think we need to get more specific.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.900]   So let's step back now with that little bit of introduction
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.060]   and talk about the issue of compulsions
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300]   driving us to Twitter and blogs,
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.420]   even theologically good things.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.260]   And this could be any other good thing
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.600]   we do compulsively as well.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   So this is not the question of addiction
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.980]   or compulsion to pornography or gambling.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.500]   This is a good thing that's being talked about here.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.040]   So the question here is not, is it wrong to do,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.500]   but is it wrong to do it this much?
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.140]   Is it wrong to desire it with this level of intensity
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.580]   in proportion to other things?
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.580]   And is it such that I'm ruining my best judgment by caving?
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.100]   And why would that be?
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.460]   Why am I not acting in accordance with my best judgment?
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.940]   So in other words, a God-pleasing life of faith
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.200]   and love and holiness is a life,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.940]   not just avoiding bad things and doing good things,
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.340]   it's a life of doing good things with good motives
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.180]   in proper proportion to other good things.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.460]   That's what he's really wrestling with.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.060]   So here's my strategy.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.980]   I'll just close with these, I think, three or four ideas.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.460]   Number one, be saturated with the scriptures
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   so that God's revealed proportionality becomes instinctual.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.340]   It's very difficult to come up with lists or timeframes
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.040]   about how many blogs to read
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.640]   or how much time to spend on Twitter.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.340]   I mean, you just can't do it.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.500]   It has to become instinctual.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.740]   The sense of holiness and proportion in the Christian life
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.080]   must become instinctual.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.020]   I don't know any other way for that to happen,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.260]   but to be totally immersed in God's proportionality
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260]   as it's revealed in his word
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.700]   by reading the sweep of scripture over and over again.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   Number two, let's pray that God would make us discerning
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.060]   and would overcome blind spots,
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.120]   because a lot of us just don't have even a clue
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.660]   that our lives are out of proportion in this regard.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.540]   And number three, by God's grace,
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.560]   we should seek to bring the intensity of our desires
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.300]   into balance with the diversity of the good things
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.780]   God gives us to do.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.820]   So relationships at home and work and church,
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.580]   as well as all these other good things
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.200]   of reading that we're doing.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.140]   So bring our desires into balance
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.040]   according to the diversity of good things
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.180]   God has put in front of us.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.820]   And lastly, we should be in a church
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.820]   with solid biblical preaching and a network of people
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.800]   who will help us see when our lives are out of proportion
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.300]   and help us change.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.420]   - Amen, that is golden life wisdom for balance
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.980]   and for deciding between any two good things.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.980]   Well, the weekend is upon us again,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.260]   and for everything you need to know about this podcast
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.500]   and to send John Piper a question,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.680]   a very carefully crafted, concise, and specific question,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.100]   Also, as many of you know, the new features
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.580]   in the Ask Pastor John app for Apple and Android devices
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.500]   now accommodates for continuous listening of episodes.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.780]   Special thanks to Ross Chasey and to our tech team at DG
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.300]   for getting this feature added recently.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.100]   And of course, thank you to the many financial donors
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.580]   that make it possible for us to get this podcast
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.300]   and these apps to you free of charge.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.140]   Well, tomorrow is Saturday.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.780]   Should it be a day of work or should it be a day of rest?
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.660]   The creation pattern set for us is six days of work
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.180]   and one day of rest, but our economy is largely built
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.780]   on a rhythm of five days of work and two days of non-work.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.260]   So which pattern is right?
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260]   I'll ask John Piper that question on Monday.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.260]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.500]   Have a great weekend.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.660]   (upbeat music)
