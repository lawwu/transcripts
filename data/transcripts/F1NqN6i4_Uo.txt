[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   All right, so this will be question number eight.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.440]   Do a little mental math here.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.340]   Question number eight comes from Matt.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.000]   Matt says, "It seems to me that a lot of your views
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.480]   "that you're most famous for are contrarian.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.060]   "This seems to have served you pretty well.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.340]   "Do you often reflexively adopt these contrarian views?
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.240]   "If so, does it ever end up backfiring?
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.680]   "And if you are selective in adopting
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840]   "certain contrarian views, what factors do you weigh
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.340]   "when deciding to go against a grain?"
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.480]   Well, two points, Matt.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   One, not all of my views are contrarian.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.800]   I would say there's really three large categories,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.880]   the type of stuff I write about.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.040]   So I do have some well-known contrarian views.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   In particular, my pushback against the idea
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.800]   that you should follow your passion
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.240]   and my pushback against using social media.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.520]   Those, at least in the moments in which I articulated those,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.880]   were quite contrarian, not so much anymore.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.600]   A lot of my other popular ideas, however,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.680]   I would put in a different category.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.480]   I would say it is structuring and articulating
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.420]   clearly things people already believe.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.920]   They just need someone to help them
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.180]   organize their pre-existing feeling.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.120]   So with contrarian ideas, you're often trying
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.160]   to convince someone to change their mind about something.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.080]   You think following your passion is the right thing to do.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.800]   I wanna convince you of something different.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.280]   Here's a secret.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.080]   It's hard to have a really successful nonfiction book
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.120]   convincing people to change their mind.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.120]   What's much more effective is giving structure and voice
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.780]   to something they already believe.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.040]   So a lot of my popular ideas fall under that category.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.120]   "Deep Work" is an example.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.640]   It's not contrarian.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.400]   That book didn't do well because people picked it up
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.200]   and said, "No way!
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.960]   What do you mean 'Deep Work'?
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.840]   I want more email.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.680]   What are you talking about?"
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.880]   And then they read it and they were convinced.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   No, that's not how that book was successful.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.080]   People were overwhelmed.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.500]   They knew something was wrong
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.600]   with the way work was unfolding.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.760]   And this gave voice to it.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.640]   That's why that book was successful.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.080]   Slow productivity is like that.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.760]   People feel this discomfort with burnout.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360]   They feel the ambiguity and lack of specification
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.120]   around our notions of what we even mean to be productive.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   And when they hear slow productivity, just that term,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.480]   when they hear the three principles,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.980]   do fewer things, working at a natural pace,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.580]   obsessing over quality, it sounds right from moment one.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.600]   Structure articulating things people already believe.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280]   Same with a lot of my work on the deep life.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.180]   I'm convincing people that deep life is worthwhile.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.480]   They know that.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   Trying to give some structure
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.160]   to that already existing impulse.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080]   And then the final category of stuff I write about,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.280]   it's like a lot of my New Yorker writing.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.360]   It's more just observing and explaining trends.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.480]   It's an expository.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.760]   So I would say most of my stuff actually is not contrarian.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.460]   I do like contrarian ideas though, Matt,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.100]   and I think it comes from my appreciation
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.620]   of the Socratic dialectic.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.200]   A lot of people think this, you think that.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.920]   Two opposing views collide.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.360]   Truth aburges.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.620]   Big believer on hitting one view against another,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.760]   taking something you believe in
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.960]   and getting the best articulation
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.200]   to get someone to believe something different.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   In that collision of opposition,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.140]   the roots of deeper understanding are grown.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.360]   So when I do go towards the contrarian,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.260]   it's probably motivated by the dialectic.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.020]   (upbeat music)
