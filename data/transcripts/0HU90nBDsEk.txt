[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   Well, the best emails we get are questions that put concrete words to what otherwise
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.640]   floats in the back of our minds as a sort of an abstract question that we can't really
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.600]   put our finger on.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.320]   Here's a question today about whether being popular and well-liked are crucial to our
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.720]   gospel witness, and it comes from a listener named Jacob.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.920]   "Pastor John, am I wrong if people around me don't like me?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.600]   Does being unliked by others make me a bad representative of Christ?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.880]   We can't be people pleasers all the time or we will be pushovers.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.040]   And at what point has our seeking to be accepted by people compromised our faithfulness to
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   God?"
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.200]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jacob?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.600]   I think what might be helpful to do in answer to Jacob's question is to illustrate for him
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   how from Scriptures he might go about answering his own question.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.880]   And I hope in doing it this way, really a hundred questions of this nature, and lots
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.040]   of natures, might be answered in the sense that people will realize that all John Piper
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:27.240]   does to get ready for these little 10-minute talks is to open my Bible and find some Scriptures
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.000]   that come close to relating to the issue and think about them and then put my thoughts
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   down.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.360]   Frankly, I think most people who listen to APJ—that's a particular kind of people—could
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.720]   do this if they were encouraged actually to work at it.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   I'm encouraging you.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   You could do this.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   You could have your own little APJ or APP or whatever.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.520]   I'd like to empower you to do that.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760]   So just watch now.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.120]   First thing I did was to type the word "please" because we're talking about when is it right
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.240]   to please people, when is it not right to please people.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.880]   I typed the word "please" into my Logos.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120]   You can have—there are a lot of different Bible programs out there.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.840]   I happen to use Logos.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   I typed it into my Bible computer search, and I told it to find all the places where
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.720]   "please" or "pleased" is used in Paul because I knew that a bunch of places in Paul that
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.320]   I couldn't think of where they were dealt with this very issue of sometimes pleasing
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.680]   people and sometimes not pleasing people.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.360]   And boop, there they come.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.040]   A whole bunch of uses of "please," not all of them relevant.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.200]   And I picked out the five that were relevant, and I isolated them, and I began to read them.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   And as I read them, I circled and I underlined and I emboldened words that seemed relevant
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.640]   for answering the question, "Now, when's it right to please people?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.360]   When's it wrong to please people?"
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.640]   Is Paul tipping me off in these verses as to when he does it and when he doesn't do
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   it?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.080]   And I assume Paul's not contradicting himself, and so here's what I'm going to do.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.440]   I'm just going to read you these five verses and show you what I saw, because I think you
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.240]   could see it, and then you wouldn't have to write APJ.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.640]   So Galatians 1, verse 10.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.440]   I mean, Tony, you know we are into empowering people to go to the Bible and find God and
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.000]   help there not be dependent on me.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So here we go.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.480]   Galatians 1, 10.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.520]   Paul has just said some unbelievably harsh things about those who are bringing a different
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520]   gospel.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.080]   He says, "If anyone," this is verse 9, "If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.920]   to the one you received, let him be accursed, damned."
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.660]   Now those are not pleasing words to the false teachers, I dare say.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.280]   Now should Paul worry about that?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.040]   He has just displeased somebody big time.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.640]   My guess is lots of contemporary readers don't like it either.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.800]   So he says in verse 10, "Am I trying to get the approval of man or God?
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.560]   Am I trying to please man?
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.240]   If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.200]   So the least we can conclude from these words is that sometimes being a faithful servant
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   of Christ when the gospel is being corrupted will require harsh words, and we should not
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.280]   let that stand in our way that these are displeasing to some people.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.080]   Number two, 1 Thessalonians 2, 3 through 6, here's what he says, "Just as we have been
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.760]   approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak not to please man, but to please
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.920]   God who tests our hearts.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   For we never came with flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed, God is witness,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others."
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.560]   Now, that seems to me to be really helpful because Paul mentions three things at least
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:40.000]   that he is trying to avoid in pleasing other people in the way he talks.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.400]   He's trying to avoid flattery, he's avoiding giving a pretext for greed, and he's avoiding
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.300]   trying to get glory from people.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.680]   In other words, what Paul was opposed to here was trying to please people by buttering them
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   up in the hope of getting money or getting praise and glory.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.000]   So the key issue there in 1 Thessalonians 2 is not primarily whether somebody likes
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.800]   what you say or doesn't like it, the issue is are you self-serving or are you other-serving?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.280]   Are you manipulating the relationship to try to say what they want to hear because you
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.600]   want money or you want glory or you want something that they don't expect you to want given what
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   you're saying?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.440]   Here's the third text, Colossians 3:22, "Bond servants, obey in everything those who are
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.160]   your earthly masters, not by way of eye service as men-pleasers," not by way of eye service
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.320]   as men, people-pleasers, "but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord."
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   So it seems to me that what Paul means by eye service is that the goal is really not—the
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.560]   goal of somebody who talks with eye service or acts with eye service is not to really
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:18.360]   go any deeper than what meets the eye, which is why Paul contrasts it with "sincerity
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.320]   of heart" and with "fearing the Lord."
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:32.480]   In other words, pleasing someone might be just fine if it was not insincere and if it
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.960]   didn't compromise fearing the Lord.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:44.080]   And just real quick, the two passages that say he does try to please people are 1 Corinthians
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.560]   10, 31 to 33, goes like this, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, to all
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.000]   to the glory of God, give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, just
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.040]   as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.120]   of many that they may be saved."
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.380]   And Romans 15, 1 and 2, "We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:23.000]   of the weak and not to please ourselves, but let each of you please his neighbor for his
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.360]   good to build him up."
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:35.040]   So when Paul is trying to please others, he says five things about it that make it good.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.240]   One, "I'm not seeking my own advantage."
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.400]   Two, "I'm seeking their advantage."
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.360]   Three, "I'm trying to bring them to salvation."
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Four, "I'm seeking their good."
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.120]   Five, "I'm seeking to build them up," that is in faith and holiness.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.520]   So summary, I think the answer to Jacob's question about when it's right, when it's
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.480]   wrong to please people would go something like this.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.520]   And all I'm doing now is trying to summarize.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.280]   These don't come out of nowhere.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.680]   I'm just trying to summarize what we've seen in those verses.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.000]   If you are not motivated by flattery and not motivated by trying to manipulate people to
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.520]   get money for yourself or glory or praise for yourself, if you are not speaking or acting
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:33.640]   insincerely but in the fear of God, if you are seeking their advantage and their good
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.960]   and their salvation and their up-building, if all those things characterize your behavior
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.120]   and your speech, then yes, yes, yes, seek to please people.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:54.640]   Your effort to please them will be protected from sin and it will be used for righteousness
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.200]   and for the glory of God.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.560]   Well, there's the model for APJ.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   There's nothing to it.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.400]   You can do it yourself if you want to try.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   There it is, the blueprint.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.400]   But if you still want to send emails to us, I would really appreciate it.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   You can send those our way from our online home.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   It's zaharangod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:20.560]   Well, one word you will not find in a Bible concordance is the word minimalism.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   Minimalism is part of the lingo of American culture right now and it's a trend in technological
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   asceticism and simplified living in tiny houses, micro apartments, and streamlined wardrobes.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.840]   And of course, Pastor John has been for years calling Christians to a wartime lifestyle.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.520]   So what's the difference between wartime living and minimalism living?
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.120]   Is there a difference?
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.360]   That's the question up on Friday.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.800]   It's going to be a good one, I think.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.160]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast and we'll see you next time.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.660]   [END]
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.660]   1.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   John R. Reike, The Godfather of the Bible.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.660]   In his book, The Godfather, John John, the Godfather of the Bible, he says, "The Bible
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.660]   is a book of the Word.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.660]   It is a book of the Word and a book of the Word."
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.660]   And the Word is a book of the Word.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   And the Word is a book of the Word.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.660]   And the Word is a book of the Word.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   And the Word is a book of the Word.
