[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.360]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited you're here for another episode where I
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.640]   get to answer all the questions you've sent in.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   And first off, thank you so much for taking the time to share them.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.800]   I've gotten so many great questions and I'm excited to dive in and answer them.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.320]   As I mentioned in my last mailbag episode, I'm going to start splitting
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.920]   these into three different categories, points and miles, money, and life.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.520]   The last one was all about money.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.480]   So this one's going to be all about credit cards, points, and miles.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.280]   And specifically, we're going to focus on a few things.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.240]   First, credit cards, the best ones right now, including some of my favorite two
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.040]   card combos, my favorite cards for families, businesses, and more, and I'll
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.840]   also cover some nuance around how authorized users work, especially when it
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360]   comes to helping others build credit.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.000]   Next, I'll focus on racking up points and ways to earn more of them on a small
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.560]   budget and meet the minimum spends for these big signup bonuses.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   I'll address whether it ever makes sense to buy points or
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.520]   pay fees to use a credit card.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.880]   I'll help you figure out where to earn points when flying on foreign airlines,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.360]   and I'll address some questions about how it's possible to actually accrue hundreds
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.480]   of thousands or even millions of points.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.640]   Then, now that you're ready to earn more points, I'm going to talk about how to
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   prevent them from expiring and answer a question about what happens to your
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.360]   points when you die, and finally, I'll jump into redeeming and talk about my
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.440]   favorite transfer partners, how to redeem for large groups, my points stack, as one
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.880]   listener asked, meaning what tools and services I use for points, and finally,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.800]   how far in advance you should be looking to book flights with points and miles.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.360]   It makes me so happy to have all of these questions to cover, so let's get started.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.400]   Actually, before we do a few things, first, if you aren't subscribed to the
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.720]   All The Hacks newsletter, you definitely should do that for a few reasons.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.320]   First, every two weeks, I show the top deals I've found.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.720]   I'll include an example of what that looks like at the end of this episode,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.000]   but so many subscribers have been using those deals to save money,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.440]   and I don't want you to miss out.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   Also, I'm trying to take some of the best learnings and tactics from the
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   podcast and write them up in the newsletter so you have some notes to reference.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   It won't cover everything, but it will cover a lot, so head on over to
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.000]   allthehacks.com/email to sign up.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   Also, the next listener question episode will be all about everything
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   other than money and points, so whether you have a question about life, non-points
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.240]   related travel, relationships, raising kids, your career, productivity, or really
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.120]   anything, please send them in, even if it's a quick and easy question.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.360]   I'd love to hear from you.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.760]   Okay, let's get started.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.320]   I'm going to start with cards because I've gotten so many questions from you
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.560]   guys asking what are the best cards right now with a lot of different caveats and
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.000]   questions, so we're going to get into all of it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.840]   I'll just start this by saying, if you're going to sign up for any card, please head
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.360]   on over to allthehacks.com/cards and use the links there.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.960]   It really supports the show and me and everything I'm doing, and obviously, if
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.120]   there's a better deal somewhere else, use that.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.840]   I want you to get the most points possible, but for almost every card, I
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.480]   think the best deals out there are there, and so obviously, thank you so much in
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   advance for using those links.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.160]   Let's get in.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.920]   I thought it might make sense to just start with what some of my favorite cards
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.960]   are just broadly.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.360]   Forget sign-up bonuses right now, just if you're looking to get one or maybe pair it
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.080]   with two cards, let me share some of my favorites.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.600]   Now, in a bunch of past episodes, I've talked about why I like transferable
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.160]   points, so I'm not going to go too deep on that other than to say, when you get a
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.120]   card with Citi, Chase, Amex, Cap One, those points can transfer to lots of
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   different airlines.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.000]   You can book travel in their portal.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.280]   You can even redeem those points for gift cards and cash back, and so I love the
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   flexibility of having cards in those programs, so those are usually what I'm
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.040]   going to recommend and suggest for everyone as their primary cards.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.320]   I'm actually going to go through each of them and talk about what I think are the
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.200]   best combos of cards within those different financial institutions.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.680]   I'll start with Chase because it's what I know a lot of people started with, the
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.320]   Chase Preferred or the Chase Reserve, and I think those are both great cards,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.600]   earning three points on dining, two points on travel with the Preferred, three
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.160]   points on travel with the Reserve.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   A lot of people listening I know spend money on travel and dining, so those are
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.560]   great cards.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.040]   Chase's points are super flexible.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   Lately, the Reserve card has been really cranking up the annual fee.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   It's up to $550 now.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.440]   I will caveat that the first $300 you spend on travel every year gets credited
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.240]   on your account, so that's really easy to use up.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   So really, the annual fee is about $250, but you've got to ask yourself, do you
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.240]   spend enough on travel that getting one extra point is worth a $250 annual fee?
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.400]   Yes, you also get access to lounges.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.720]   Yes, you get a couple of extra perks like DoorDash, DashPass, but you have to ask
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.520]   yourself that question.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   Also, if you redeem your points in the Portal, which we've talked about in the
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   past, you do get more value out of them.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   You get 1.5 cents for those points if you're using the Reserve card.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.880]   So if I'm looking at Chase, I think the Preferred or the Reserve are great
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   options, and if I was going to pair it with one other card in the Chase
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   ecosystem, it would be the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.880]   And that's because you earn one and a half points on everything.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   It doesn't matter the category.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.800]   You also get three points on dining, which is the same as the Sapphire cards, three
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.280]   points on drugstores, which I'm guessing you don't spend that much, but if you do,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.640]   great.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.240]   And right now, if you sign up for the Freedom Unlimited, which has no annual
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.200]   fee, you get an extra one and a half percent on everything for the first year,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.080]   up to $20,000 to spend.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   And you've heard me kind of go between saying one and a half points, one and a
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.720]   half percent.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.560]   That's because the Freedom Unlimited is marketed as a cashback card, which
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.200]   actually you'll hear common amongst a lot of the cards I'm going to talk about.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.160]   But when you pair it with a Chase Preferred or Reserve, that cashback can be
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.200]   converted to points.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.800]   So if you only had a Freedom Unlimited, yes, it's a one and a half percent
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.360]   cashback card that in the first year earns 3% cashback.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.800]   But if you pair it with the Preferred or the Reserve, you earn points instead of
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.680]   cashback.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.000]   And as we've talked about a lot, transferring those points gets you much
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.200]   better value, which is why sites like the Points Guy put the value of Capital One,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.360]   Chase, Amex, and Citi Points at anywhere from like 1.7 to 2 cents.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.520]   So you're getting a lot more out of the Freedom Unlimited if you pair it with the
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.960]   Chase Preferred or Reserve.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.080]   So at Chase, my favorite two card combo, Chase Preferred or Chase Reserve paired
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.960]   with the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.600]   At Citi, the Citi Premier right now has the biggest sign up bonus it's ever had
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.920]   at 80,000 points.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.720]   It's a low annual fee card of $95 and you get three points per dollar on gas,
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.920]   groceries, dining, airfare, and hotels.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.440]   I think it's a great travel card.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.320]   It's a great everything card because of all those things.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.520]   And it pairs so well with the Citi Double Cash.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.800]   So just like the Freedom Unlimited, Citi Double Cash is marketed as a cashback
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.640]   card, but when you have both, you can use that cashback and convert it to thank
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.480]   you points and earn two points per dollar on everything you spend.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.280]   So you're getting two points on everything, three X on gas, groceries,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.840]   dining, airfare, and hotels.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.920]   I think that's a great combo at Citi.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.920]   With Capital One, I've talked a lot about the Venture X card recently because they
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.000]   had a huge sign up bonus and it's just a great two X on everything card.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.520]   Capital One's been adding a ton of transfer partners lately.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.960]   So I think they have a really great opportunity for you to use those points
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.160]   to transfer to airlines and get great redemptions on flights, especially
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   international, business class, all of that.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.520]   There's two cards.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.840]   There's the Venture and the Venture X.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.640]   And it's similar to the Preferred and the Reserve.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.840]   The Venture has a $95 annual fee.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.160]   The Venture X has a $395 annual fee, but they both offer 75,000 points sign up
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.680]   bonus.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.640]   The main difference is that with the Venture X you're paying an extra $300
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.320]   annual fee, but you're also getting $300 towards travel as long as it's booked in
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.520]   the portal every year, plus 10,000 miles on your anniversary every year.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.760]   You can also go to the Capital One lounges with the Venture X card, but
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.920]   there's only a couple of them.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.080]   So depending on where you live, it might not matter.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.760]   But if you have a Venture or a Venture X card, I think it pairs so well with
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.120]   the Capital One Saver card.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.360]   Cheryl actually wrote in and said, "Do you know if you can combine all of these
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.560]   Capital One card points and cashbacks with each other?"
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.200]   And the answer is, when you have a Capital One card that earns miles, like
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.920]   the Venture, the Venture X, or the Spark miles, if you also have a cashback card,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.520]   you can convert that cashback to miles.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.760]   So the Saver card earns 4x miles on dining, entertainment, and streaming,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.000]   and 3x miles on groceries.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.400]   And it's only a $95 annual fee.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.560]   It doesn't have a huge bonus like the Venture and the Venture X card.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.240]   It's only 30,000 points right now, or marketed as $300.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.280]   But if you combine those two cards, you're earning 4x on dining,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.800]   entertainment, streaming, groceries, and 2x on everything else.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   It's a great combo.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.400]   The only thing it's really missing is the travel category.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.880]   So if travel is a bulk of your spend, it might not be the best combo, but
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.640]   I think it's a really solid combo.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.120]   Last is Amex.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.800]   Amex Gold card is one of my favorites.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.120]   It earns four points on dining and groceries.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.440]   It's got a 70,000 point signup bonus.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.280]   Amex has a ton of great transfer partners.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.360]   And in fact, I'll talk more in the deal section, but right now there's transfer
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.160]   bonuses of 15 to 30% on 12 different partners.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.440]   So Amex points are really great.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.160]   I'm so glad I have a bunch of them.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.760]   But when it comes to pairing with the Gold, a lot of people ask me, "Oh, do
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.080]   you pair it with the Platinum card?"
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.360]   I'll get to that later, but I don't think the Platinum card is the best
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.200]   earning card.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.680]   In fact, the Amex Green card is kind of underlooked because it usually
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.400]   doesn't have a huge signup bonus, but it does offer 3x on travel and restaurants.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.360]   Obviously, if you're pairing it with the Gold card, you don't need the 3x on
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.480]   restaurants because you get 4x on dining with Gold, but 3x on travel makes the
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.560]   Amex combo really compelling.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.920]   You get 4x on dining, 4x on groceries, 3x on travel if you've got the green and the
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.360]   Gold.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.560]   So if you're all in on Amex, I think that's a great combo.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.960]   And the reason I brought up the combos is because I think when you're just
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.600]   getting started, before you're kind of really crazy deep in the points game,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.040]   it's way easier when all of your points are in one place.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.240]   So I would say until you have maybe 100 or 200,000 points in one place, I would
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.680]   really encourage you to maybe not necessarily spread your points too thin
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.440]   across too many programs because it can be tough to redeem things when you're
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.800]   having to use points from one program on part of the trip and another for the
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.480]   rest of the trip.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.440]   That said, there are certain transfer partners like Air France where you can
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.960]   transfer to Chase, Citi, Amex, and Capital One points to them.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.360]   So it's not impossible if you've got points across different programs.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.280]   It just sometimes makes it a little harder.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.160]   So those are my favorite combos.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.960]   If you want to look within each institution, what's the one or two card
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.440]   combo that I love?
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.240]   But a lot of the people that wrote me in weren't asking about the best card to
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.720]   use.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.080]   They were asking about some of the best bonuses right now.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.240]   And when it comes to the best bonuses, some of the cards with the best bonuses
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.720]   right now are in that list too.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.680]   So the Venture Venture X at 75,000 miles, the Amex Gold at 70,000, and the Citi
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.240]   Premier at 80,000 are really great bonuses.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.080]   If you value those points at anywhere from 1.7 to 2 points, that means that at a
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.760]   bare minimum, you're getting anywhere from $1,200 to $1,600 worth of value from
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.000]   just the signup bonus.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.920]   As I mentioned, I didn't include the Amex Platinum in that list because the only
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.440]   bonus category it has is 5X on airfare.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.800]   So look, if you book a ton of flights, it can be a really valuable card.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.440]   Other than that, it's really more of a perks card and a signup bonus card.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.960]   Right now you can get a hundred thousand points for signing up.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   That's amazing.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.280]   But unless you have another Amex card, you've got to keep the card open so that
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.600]   those points don't expire.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.240]   And we'll talk about expiring points later, but it really comes down to whether
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.200]   you can justify the $695 annual fee.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.960]   You're getting $300 towards Equinox, $240 towards different streaming services,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.360]   another $200 towards airline incidentals, but only with one airline, $200 on Uber,
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:07.640]   but only $15 a month, $189 towards Clear, $50 every six months towards Saks, $200
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.040]   towards hotels, but only if they're booked on their platform and they're
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.280]   only a certain set of them.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.720]   The question is like, are you actually going to get enough value out of there?
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.000]   Because that's $695 could go to a lot of other places.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.280]   So it's really something to consider.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.160]   Obviously, if you're getting it for one year and you're just going for a
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.440]   hundred thousand points, it's probably worth it.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.360]   I'd say for me, I'm probably usually able to get somewhere around
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.080]   $500 of value out of that $695.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.280]   So if I'm booking a lot of flights, yeah, it's still worth it to have it.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.040]   Otherwise it's not though.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.880]   Fun fact, if you have a business and you're using your cards for business and
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.080]   I'm not a CPA, but I believe the annual fees on your credit card are eligible
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.600]   business expenses, so maybe that saves you some money and also thanks to Brandy
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   and Zach for writing in to remind me that Amex, Chase, Capital One, Citi, and
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.240]   US Bank will all waive credit card annual fees for active duty military and
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.760]   their spouses and Zach would know because between he and his wife, they have 20
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.720]   different cards with $8,700 of annual fees getting waived, which fun fact is
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.440]   actually more than he even makes in a year being in the National Guard.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.320]   So maybe there's a hack, join the National Guard, open up all the high fee
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.160]   cards, coming back to the platinum.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.360]   Obviously, if you're in the military, it's a no brainer as are any of these
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.080]   high fee cards that have big perks like travel credits and annual free night
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.880]   certificates.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.280]   Two other cards that I think are worth addressing just because they have huge
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.200]   signup bonuses right now in terms of sheer numbers.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.520]   It's the two Hilton cards, both have six figure signup bonuses.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.280]   The base one is a zero annual fee card with 100,000 points.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.720]   The surpass is a $95 annual fee, but it's waived the first year and it's 130,000
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.200]   points.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.760]   I think they're great cards for the points.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.200]   I think they're great cards if you spend a lot of money at Hilton's because you
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.800]   earn something like seven to 12 Hilton points per dollar using the card, but I
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.880]   will flag that in general, Hilton points are worth a lot less than points like
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.000]   Chase or Capital One.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.880]   If you look at the points guy, Hilton points are worth 0.6 cents versus Chase
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.200]   points at two cents.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   So you really should be thinking of getting 100,000 Hilton points is almost
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.320]   like 30,000 Chase points.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640]   So while the bonuses look really big and if you have plans for Hilton, they can be
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.600]   really valuable.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.480]   It's not nearly apples to apples when looking at 100,000 Hilton points at 100,000
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.160]   Chase points.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.360]   The other one is the IHG card.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.480]   It's 140,000 points signup bonus plus a free night every year.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.160]   Plus when you're spending money at IHG, you get another 16 points per dollar just
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.120]   using the card.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.240]   It's a 99 annual fee card.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   So if you're staying a lot of IHG properties, this is great.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.800]   If you just need a big boost in IHG points to make a redemption, it can be
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.240]   great.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.960]   But again, IHG points are valued around half a cent a point.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.120]   So if you're comparing this to Chase, 140,000 points might only be equal to like
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.600]   35,000 Chase points.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.400]   That's not to say there's not a way to make it worth a lot more.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.720]   I look at these hotel cards and I see these huge six-figure signup bonuses, and
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.600]   I just want to put it in perspective that the reason why is the same reason I don't
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.760]   love transferring most credit card points to hotels because the redemption value for
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.840]   hotel points is anywhere from half to a third or a quarter of the value of
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.920]   redeeming with airlines.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.120]   Hyatt being the notable exception.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.000]   I'm a big fan of transferring Chase and Bilt points to Hyatt.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.960]   The last card I'll mention is Bilt.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.160]   The Bilt rewards card earns three points on travel and dining and one on everything
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.560]   else.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.640]   But the real magic with the Bilt card is if you have rent because you earn up to
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.920]   50,000 points a year paying your rent with the credit card and there's no fees.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.440]   So if you're a renter, the Bilt card is a no brainer, but that's a great card for
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.840]   earning points on rent and it's a great card for earning points on travel and
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.520]   dining and their points are super flexible.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.360]   Maybe the best points of all of these programs, but just the hardest to get
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.000]   because there aren't multiple cards with signup bonuses.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.120]   There aren't multiple cards for different categories, but the points you do have
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.400]   are great because they go to Hyatt, which is my favorite hotel partner.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.160]   They go to American, which isn't a transfer partner of any other card.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.880]   They go to United and they go to KLM and a lot of other airlines.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.880]   I think it's a great card, but it's just really hard to get points if you don't
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.280]   pay rent because there's just one Bilt card.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.480]   And that's thanks to Viore and I'm excited to be partnering
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.720]   with them for this episode.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.440]   They make performance apparel.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.040]   That's incredibly versatile.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.400]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.120]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.920]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.320]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.960]   right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.800]   And it's not just for men.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.520]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.200]   My favorite is the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.160]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.800]   comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.120]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.040]   it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.360]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their meta
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.240]   pants can even work for a night out.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.640]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.

[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.520]   I want to tell you all about the most amazing way to buy a second home.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.320]   And I know because we actually bought one for 1/8th the cost.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.520]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.520]   I'm talking about Picasso and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.560]   So how does it work?
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.320]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.280]   creates an LLC for each home, and you can buy as little as 1/8th of the property.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.720]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   Picasso also professionally manages the home, handling design, cleaning, bills,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.240]   repairs, taxes, and more, and the scheduling system makes it fair and
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.600]   equitable for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.480]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.600]   That same week we found the perfect place in Napa, we toured it,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.360]   and the next week we were closing.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.720]   Since then, it's truly become our second home and it's been so amazing.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.920]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.000]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price, and tap into Picasso's
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.560]   active marketplace of buyers.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:50.760]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days with a 12% annualized
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:57.520]   gain. For a modern way to buy and own a second home, go to allthehacks.com/picaso

[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.520]   credit towards closing costs.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:15.120]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasopacaso.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.600]   So I'll transition a little bit to talk about a few of the questions I got.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.360]   So Judy asked if I had any suggestions because her daughter's just started
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.320]   college and she's across the country and they're going to be traveling.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.920]   She asked about the American Airlines card with a 60,000 point bonus.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.320]   Normally I would say you'd be much better off with any of these other cards.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.920]   But if you are only flying American and you really want American miles other
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   than the built card, there isn't a great card to get to earn American miles.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.960]   However, it's important to know that every single one of these programs,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.040]   Capital One, Chase, Amex, they all have transfer partners that
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.560]   are in the One World Alliance.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.600]   And that means that you can use British Airways, Avios points or other One World
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.480]   Airline points to book flights on American.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.120]   So Judy, if the reason you asked about American was because that's who you need
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.400]   to fly, you can book American flights with BA miles, which you can get from
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.560]   any of these other programs.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   So I personally would rather have a card like the venture card with 75,000 points
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.360]   signup or city with 80,000 points signup than an American card with 60,000 points.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.960]   Not just because the signup is better, but because most airline cards are only
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.880]   going to give you big bonuses on spending with the airlines.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.560]   For example, you actually earn more United points because Chase can transfer
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.160]   to United using the Chase Sapphire reserve card, booking even a United
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.200]   flight than you do with the United card.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.240]   So I think the airline cards are great for the perks, whether it's free check
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.200]   bags or lounge access, great for signup bonuses, but when it comes to the best
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.560]   cards to get, to start trying to plan for free trips across the country.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.200]   I think the ones I mentioned earlier are a lot better.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   And one other question, kind of similar one from both Chase and Laura were
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   about upcoming big spending.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.840]   So for Chase, it was a destination wedding for Laura.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.560]   It was a bunch of home improvements and they both asked what cards to use.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.200]   Now, one thing I'll point out is that when it comes to weddings and home
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.280]   improvements, they might be really big expenditures, but most of the expenses
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.000]   associated with them, you can't use a credit card on.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.960]   So as much as they might be big expenses, it might not be possible.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.120]   Chase did mention it's a destination wedding, so he probably has a lot of
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.600]   travel, so there's a lot of opportunity there, but I know for our renovation,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.560]   I don't think there was more than $500 I could put on a credit card because our
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.520]   contractors didn't take credit cards.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.800]   And a lot of the people we bought supplies from didn't either.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.520]   So I think about it in three ways.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.720]   One is on signup bonuses.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.640]   So there's a bunch of cards with anywhere from, I'd say that the floor I like to
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.800]   look at is 70,000 and more points for signing up.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.640]   So if you have a lot of expenses coming up, it'll make it really easy to hit those
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.440]   minimum spends in order to get those bonus points.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.720]   It can be anywhere from five to $50,000 of spend and anywhere from three to six
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.200]   months.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.080]   So, you know, if you have a bunch of big expenses, I think it's a great opportunity
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.160]   to open up a card with big signup bonuses, or maybe even a few.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   If that spend is in a certain category, let's say for example, Chase, if your
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.840]   destination wedding means you're going to be buying 20 plane tickets for family
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.800]   members and booking 20 hotel rooms, then I would absolutely also consider what
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.880]   category you're going to be spending on and make sure you have a card that earns
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.440]   the most points in that category.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.760]   So for destination wedding, if it's travel, it's a card like the City Premier or the
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   Chase Reserve or the Amex Green that are going to earn three points per dollar on
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.520]   travel.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.200]   The last category, and it's a little bit of a weird one, but it's about using
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.360]   those cards to get perks or status.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.960]   So with the American, Delta and Hyatt cards, you can actually spend enough
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   money to earn status.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.840]   In many cases, it's well over $100,000, but if you really valued the status on any
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.560]   of those airlines or hotel groups, you could spend your way to that status.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.840]   Or if you have a Southwest card and you want to spend over $120,000, you can earn
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.000]   your way to Companion Pass, which would let your companion travel for free for the
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.400]   rest of the year you earn it and the next year.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.000]   So just to recap, if you have a big set of expenses coming up, think about what kind
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.280]   of signup bonuses you can earn.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.760]   If those expenses are in a category you can get bonuses on, make sure you've got a
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.440]   card that hits those bonuses.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   And if you care about it, you could use a lot of spending to boost your status on
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.800]   airlines like American or Delta, hotels like Hyatt, or to earn Companion Pass with
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.520]   Southwest.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.080]   Okay, Neelam wrote in asking the best card for a family of six that does a lot of
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   grocery shopping.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.040]   So there was a lot of nuance to the question, but I'll focus on the grocery part
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.880]   because it's an interesting category.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.760]   The Blue Cash Preferred card markets itself as 6% back on groceries, but it's only
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   $6,000 a year.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.760]   So my favorite grocery cards in Amex, it's the Gold, it's 4x points on groceries.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.400]   It's capped at $25,000 a year, but I think that's enough for groceries for the year.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.560]   The Capital One Saver card is 3x on groceries and the City Premier is 3x on
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.160]   groceries.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.600]   So those are my favorites for groceries.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.640]   Last question on cards is from Jonathan and he asked about business cards.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.600]   So one interesting thing to note about business cards is that you don't actually
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.280]   need a legally registered business to get a business card.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.360]   Technically what you need is to have some sort of business that could be
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.240]   self-employment.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.640]   It could be freelancing, it could be consulting.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.840]   There are lots of things that apply and you can do that all under your own social
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.440]   security number.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.080]   You don't even need an EIN from a LLC or a corporation.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.760]   So the reason why business cards are super interesting is because they often have
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.200]   really big signup bonuses.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.560]   So it's definitely something that I would say, take a look at some of the best
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.000]   signup bonuses right now.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.960]   Chase Inc Preferred is 100,000 points for a $95 annual fee card.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.880]   The Chase Inc Cash and Unlimited are 75,000 points.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.480]   The Amex Business Gold is 70,000.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   The United Business Card, while I don't think it's going to be a great card to
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.960]   spend on, has 150,000 United Point bonus for a $99 annual fee card.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.400]   The Amex Business Platinum is 120,000 points.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.360]   It still has a high annual fee.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.400]   And then Capital One has a bunch of business cards that I think are great for
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   everyday use.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.520]   The Spark Cash and the Spark Miles card are two points per dollar or 2% back.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.920]   They both have 50 to 100,000 point signup bonuses.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.120]   And Capital One is supposedly releasing a new card.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.200]   It's not available to sign up for now, but it'll be like the business version of
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.280]   the Venture X card.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.520]   It'll have a $395 annual fee, but the signup bonus is rumored to be 250,000
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.000]   points.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.280]   So if you don't have a Capital One business card and you're thinking about it, I
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.760]   would maybe wait a month or two to see if that really does come out and you can sign
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.040]   up for it because a 250,000 point signup bonus is really massive and something I
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.240]   know I'm going to see if I'm eligible for.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.520]   OK, that covers all the questions about new cards and card recommendations.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.680]   But I do want to touch on one thing, which is authorized users.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.440]   So Alexis wrote in asking a ton of great questions about adding an authorized user
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.640]   to help build credit, whether it disqualifies you from fees.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.840]   So let's jump into them.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.440]   So first off, when you add an authorized user to your credit card, they don't get a
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.200]   credit check.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.920]   So that's great.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.680]   They don't have that impact on their credit report.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.960]   It's not a hard inquiry, but that card usually shows up on their credit report.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.640]   Now, depending on the bank, they may or may not backdate all the history of that
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.840]   card on this other person's credit.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.400]   So I know Amex doesn't do it, but the reports I've seen say that Capital One,
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.680]   Chase, Bank of America, Synchrony, and U.S.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.440]   Bank do, which means that someone who maybe only has one or two years of credit
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.680]   history, if they become an authorized user of a card with Chase, for example,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.280]   that has 10 years of history, all of a sudden they're going to have 10 years of
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.880]   history on their credit report.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.920]   So that can be really impactful for their credit score.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.720]   Obviously, if you add a card that is delinquent and has problems, it's probably
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.920]   not going to help their credit score, but if it has a lot of history or a high
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.600]   credit limit, it can have a big impact.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.560]   But I will say it does not disqualify them from getting the cards.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.960]   So I've added my wife to my Amex Gold, but if I were to take her off of that, she
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.040]   could actually go apply for the Amex Gold and still get the signup bonus.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.800]   One thing to know is that I believe Chase does factor authorized user accounts into
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.160]   their 5/24 calculation, meaning that Chase doesn't approve you for a new card if
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.600]   you've opened up five cards in the last 24 months.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.960]   But in this situation, if you do cancel the authorized user card, you can call the
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.360]   credit bureaus and ask them to remove the authorized user card from your report.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.120]   And that'll maybe make you eligible to open a new Chase card.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.200]   Let's now talk a bit about accruing.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.840]   I got an email from someone whose name I'll leave off, but they said, I just got
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.360]   the Amex Gold and Platinum cards and I have to do $25,000 of spend to get my
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.600]   bonuses, but I don't think I can get there.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.560]   And maybe I bit off a bit more than I could chew.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.840]   So obviously I'm not a big fan of spending money you don't need to spend, but here's
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.040]   some things you might want to consider.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   One, buying gift cards for things that you'll need to spend money on later.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.360]   Can you buy grocery store gift cards, Amazon gift cards, anything that you know
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.120]   you're going to need to spend money on in the future, you could offset spending
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.080]   money on your groceries by buying the gift cards.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.480]   Now, another one is asking friends.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   If you could help book their travel, you could even offer them like a 1% discount.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.120]   If you're getting three or four X points on your card, become a travel agent for a
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.600]   few weeks, depending on what card it is and how many points you're earning, you
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.440]   could end up paying your taxes for 1.87%.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.920]   You're probably gonna need to wait a few months or even a year for your refund
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.680]   check to come back if you're overpaying.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.280]   But if you're not going to get a hundred thousand point signup bonus on the Amex
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:51.840]   platinum card, because you're $4,000 short and paying $75 in fees to pay your taxes
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.400]   on your credit card is going to get you there.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   I'd pay $75 for a hundred thousand Amex points any day because a hundred thousand
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.800]   Amex points is probably worth close to $2,000.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.760]   Finally, if that doesn't work, or if you want to make sure you have the money
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.400]   sooner, you could just send money to someone you trust on PayPal or Venmo and
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:15.240]   pay the 2.9 or 3% fee again, if it's $5,000, that fee might cost you $150, but
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.720]   if you get $2,000 worth of points because of it, I think it's worth it.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   So I hope one of those works out because there's a lot of points on the line.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.600]   Landon wrote in with a really similar question, asking about how people who
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.880]   don't spend that much money are able to get these offers where they need to
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.720]   spend $5,000 in three months.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.440]   So first off a few of the strategies that I just talked about could be a
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.880]   way to meet those minimum spends, but the other option is to just wait until
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.520]   maybe there's a time of year, whether it's the holidays or whether there's
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.080]   a annual trip you take and timing the signup bonuses with that spend.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.640]   I know I got another email from a listener named Scott just yesterday
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.840]   that said he's got a $4,000 purchase he has to make and wanted to know if now
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.320]   is a good time to do a signup bonus.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.040]   So my advice is if you don't spend enough money to qualify for these signup bonuses,
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.200]   try to time them during points in the year where maybe you're spending a little
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.680]   bit more and pair them with some of the strategies I just mentioned, and maybe
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.400]   putting all that together can make it a bit more reasonable to spend, you
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.440]   know, $4,000 in three months.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.960]   Liam wrote in about a trip that he and his fiance booked to her homeland in New
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.120]   Zealand, and they ended up spending a ton of money on expensive flights on Korean
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.360]   Air, and they were trying to figure out what to do with Korean Air's loyalty
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   program, and so the last thing you need is a bunch of random points in an airline
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.400]   like Korean Air, which used to be a transfer partner of Chase, but no longer
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.760]   is, so what are you going to do with those points?
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.160]   Whenever I'm flying on a foreign airline and I'm using dollars to pay for the
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.440]   ticket, because if you're flying on a free ticket, you usually don't earn any
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:49.320]   miles, I always try to earn those points on an airline that I do use points in.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.200]   So if it were me and I was flying Korean Air, I'd probably credit all those
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.960]   points to either Air France or Delta, because Korean Air is part of Sky Team.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.920]   The same thing goes if I'm flying in Europe on Lufthansa, I'll credit those
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.800]   points to United, or if I'm flying on any of the One World Airlines, I'll credit
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.240]   those points to American or British Airways, because those are the two
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.760]   programs that I use the most.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.160]   So if you're flying on a foreign airline, you don't have to earn their miles,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.960]   especially if they have partners, which even airlines that aren't in alliances
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.920]   often have partners, so make sure you tell the airline where you want to credit
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.360]   those points, and if they don't let you do it easily online, you can usually do
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.960]   it at the desk in the airport.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   So Chad wrote in with a question, which was basically how do you accrue so many
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.120]   points that you're able to take all of these trips, just putting $2,000 to $3,000
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.040]   a month on credit cards doesn't seem to make this possible, asked if I was getting
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.720]   a lot of these points through referrals or influencer stuff, so I've unfortunately
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.160]   never been paid in points for influencer anything, so that one's off the table.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.360]   I have made a few referrals, I've referred on my venture card to get some bonus
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.760]   points, but they cap that out at four referrals a year, so it hasn't been that
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.400]   many, most of the points I have are coming from signup bonuses, my wife and I both
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:08.080]   signed up for a venture X card, so there's $200,000 with two cards there, you needed
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.200]   to spend $4,000, so if you're spending $2,000 or $3,000 a month in two months,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.000]   that's 200,000 points, so I don't necessarily sign up for a card every
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.920]   single month or every single quarter, but if between you or you and a partner,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.280]   you're signing up for let's say four or five cards a year and being able to meet
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.640]   those minimum spends and each one of those bonuses is let's say at least 75,000
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.480]   points, that's 300,000 points a year and that should be more than enough to take
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.760]   one nice trip every year, so that's generally how I operate and that doesn't
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.560]   include all the points I'm getting from putting my monthly expenses on my card
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.880]   and optimizing that, one other thing I did do to earn a lot of points, it's been
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.840]   quite a few years, but definitely worth trying out if any of you are at this
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.920]   stage in life, is whenever I was invited on any group trip, whether it was a
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.320]   bachelor party or my wife was invited on a bachelorette party or just a friend's
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.280]   trip, I would always offer to play travel agent for the group and book everyone's
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.520]   flights and hotels, most of my friends all thought it was a huge benefit because
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.360]   no one wants to organize all that information, but in return if we were
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.800]   taking a trip with 10 or 15 people, I was putting 10 or 15 flights on a card that
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.440]   earns three points per dollar on travel, I was putting hotel rooms or a rental on
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.880]   Airbnb on a card that earns three points on travel, so I did get pretty creative
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.520]   there for a period of time and when I was running a startup, I had some
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.840]   expenses I could put on a credit card, but not that many, I think signup bonuses
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.800]   are the bulk of the points I've earned and probably will be going forward and
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.360]   finally, I'll just share that I've gotten a few emails from listeners who've also
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.040]   done this, so I know it's possible, Alexis wrote in saying that in five months of
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.920]   getting into the points game, she's accumulated over 140,000 points and
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:00.720]   Marco said he's already earned 450,000 points from signup bonuses in 2022, so I
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.400]   know it takes work and I actually think I'm gonna do an episode about how many
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.080]   cards you can open at once, how long to wait before applications and everything
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.240]   like that, but until then I hope you guys can all start earning a lot more points,
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.360]   so that's a lot about how to accrue points, but I want to talk about Jason
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.800]   and Jeff's questions about expiring miles and how to make sure you keep them
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.960]   active, so most credit card companies, your points aren't gonna expire and a
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.040]   lot of airlines are starting to adopt policies where your airline miles don't
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.960]   expire, I know Delta is one of them, I think JetBlue also, but there are still
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.640]   some airlines like American where your miles do expire over time and so the
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.360]   easiest way to keep them active is to just make sure you have some activity
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.080]   every year or two, depending on the program, I in a spreadsheet, I track
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.800]   everything, actually have a comment that says when my points are expiring, for
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.400]   most of them the easiest way to do it is to either use a few miles, buy a few
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.320]   miles or find some way to earn a few miles, so if it's buying I usually go in
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.520]   and maybe I'll redeem a hundred or five hundred or a thousand miles for a
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.080]   magazine subscription or I'll go in and buy a hundred miles for a few dollars or
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.400]   I'll transfer some miles from Amex or Chase to that airline just so there's
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.000]   some activity to keep them going. There's a couple airlines that are really
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.800]   obscure that I think you need some activity, I want to say there was like
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.720]   Aegean Air needed some activity in the account that was based on flying so I
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.640]   credited a really short United trip I took from like San Francisco to LA, I put
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   in my Aegean number instead of my United number, but for the most part you should
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.360]   be able to go to the ways to redeem your miles and look whether there's you know
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.260]   sending a hundred miles to charity or getting a magazine subscription or
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.360]   something like that or buying a couple miles are pretty good options. You all
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.280]   know I love credit card points so I'm excited to be partnering with Card

[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:12.240]   you fast but trust me your friends are probably desperate for a good hang. So
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.320]   kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.360]   easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.560]   of the supplies. All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.040]   doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.520]   another week. With Drizzly you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.200]   off your to-do list which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.240]   houses without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.320]   were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.200]   in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store. So
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.120]   whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's

[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:41.000]   points if you cancel a card. Tontesh wrote in and said he has 60,000 Southwest
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.440]   points but wants to cancel his Southwest card and doesn't want to lose his points.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.560]   So when you have an airline or a hotel card, all the points you earn are linked
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.520]   to your hotel or airline loyalty account. So if you cancel the Southwest card, the
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.760]   United card, the Hilton card, all of your Hilton Southwest and United miles are
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.960]   safe. Obviously the card was generating points regularly, so it was keeping those
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.360]   points active in their program. So you will still need to make sure those
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.960]   points don't expire. But canceling those cards will not lose your points. But
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.760]   before you do cancel those cards, there are a few things to consider anytime
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.560]   you're canceling a card. One is if this is a card that you've had for a long
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.040]   time or has a lot of credit, you might want to see if you can downgrade it to a
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.480]   card without an annual fee so you can call or send a secure message. You can
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.600]   also call in and see if there's any retention bonuses. I got an email from
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.360]   Ben saying he wanted to cancel his platinum card because he doesn't really
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.200]   need to travel for work anymore. And I suggested he call Amex and see if
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.040]   there's offers. Ben actually said that Amex gave him two offers. One was a
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:47.280]   $150 credit to keep the card open or $400 credit if he spends $3,000 in three
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.880]   months. He figured that the $400 credit was a way better deal, so he took that
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.320]   offer and that reduced the annual fee down significantly. So definitely call.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.080]   The last option is if you decide you do want to cancel the card, if you have
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.520]   other cards with that financial institution, at least this works at Chase
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.360]   because I've done it, you can move credit around. So if you have a card with a
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.960]   $20,000 limit and you're gonna cancel it, you could reduce the limit to a
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.120]   $1,000, transfer $19,000 of that credit to another Chase card, and then cancel the
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.560]   card. One thing I will note is if you do that, when you apply for a future card,
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.480]   you might not get immediately approved because Chase doesn't want to extend
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.000]   any more credit, but you can call the reconsideration line and you can say,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.560]   "Hey, could I move credit from this other card back to this new card?" And that's a
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.720]   way to get approved for a card that you might not always get approved for. Always
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.120]   call the reconsideration line if I don't get instantly approved for a card. And
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.680]   with Chase, I now have enough Chase cards that I'm almost never getting approved
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.400]   because they've already given me as much credit as they will give. But to get back
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.840]   to the question about losing points when you cancel a card, it is different with
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.760]   Chase points, Amex points, Citi points. Any of those programs require you to have
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.000]   one card active in the program. So if all you have is a Chase Reserve card and you
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.960]   cancel your card, you're going to lose those Chase points. The same is true with
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.560]   Amex. You're gonna lose your Amex points. So what I always say is if you can get
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.520]   one card in the program, even if it's a less expensive card, that'll keep your
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.080]   points alive. So if you don't want the Chase Reserve card, could you downgrade
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.920]   it to the Chase Preferred card? You could downgrade it to the Chase Freedom card,
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.160]   but without having a Sapphire card, you're actually not able to use those
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.040]   points to transfer to airlines. So Amex, for example, has lots of Amex cards, but
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.440]   only a handful of them are eligible for membership rewards, but you could
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:40.080]   downgrade your Platinum to a Gold or a Green card. So if you are going to cancel
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.440]   a card and you have points, the one thing you can do is make sure you transfer
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.560]   those points out to another airline or hotel partner before you cancel the card.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.440]   So if you've got 50,000 Amex points and you don't want that Platinum card
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.840]   because you don't want to pay the annual fee and you don't want to downgrade it,
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.520]   maybe transfer those 50,000 points to Aeroplan or British Airways or Air
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.200]   France, whatever airline you think you're most likely to use for your future trip,
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.320]   and then you can have those points somewhere where they're not gonna expire
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:13.440]   right away. Also speaking of points, and maybe a little morbid or sad, is Matthew
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.000]   asked whether I had a plan in place to cover what happens to all of our points
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.920]   and miles if we die. He did the math, and if he looked at the value of his points,
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   it was thousands of dollars, and so he felt like that was something meaningful
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.240]   that he didn't want to just go to waste. So I went and actually looked at the
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.720]   rules because I didn't know how this worked. I have a 1Password account. All of
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.880]   my Frequent Flyer accounts are there. I have a spreadsheet that I link to in our
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.480]   Trustworthy account, so if someone has access there, they can see where all of
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.880]   our Frequent Flyer programs are and how many miles are in each balance. But what
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.080]   I wanted to know is not just where they were so that if something happened to us,
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.160]   one of our family members could find those points and figure out what to do
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.200]   with them, but what the rules were. So I looked into this, and thank you to a
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.860]   bunch of blogs online, The Points Guy and others, that have done some research here.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:05.520]   Most of the major airlines, Alaska, American, Southwest, and United, will
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.200]   actually let you transfer the points if you provide them with a death
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.720]   certificate to a beneficiary. American supposedly will do it to even multiple
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.160]   beneficiaries if you want to split them across people. The only one that looks
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.220]   like they didn't was Delta, but Delta did say you can keep using them from the
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:27.560]   deceased's account for I think it was two years. Another option though is to just
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.760]   keep using the accounts. If you have the login and you're able to log in, you can
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.560]   still book flights for other people with your miles. I do it all the time for my
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.000]   wife and our kids. So you could just keep the accounts active, but it does look
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.800]   like for most airlines except Delta, you could actually transfer them to someone,
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.880]   which I was surprised about. Hotels on the other hand, you actually can transfer
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.480]   points between people, usually for free with no challenge. Although Hyatt, I'm in
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.680]   the middle of doing this now, and you literally have to email them a PDF, and
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   it takes up to four weeks to transfer points. But given that they let you
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.240]   transfer things easily already, in this circumstance they also would let you
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.800]   transfer things. It gets a little less interesting when it comes to credit card
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.560]   points. So Amex's rule is that when it happens, you can make a one-time
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.320]   redemption. So if you had a million Amex points, you can make a one-time redemption
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.400]   transferring those 1 million Amex points to somewhere, whether it's an airline or
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.440]   a hotel group or redeeming for cash. Capital One says they automatically
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.360]   redeem all of your points towards statement credits, which is only gonna
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.600]   value them at half a cent. And Chase and Citi both say they auto-redeem those
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.400]   points for cash right away. Obviously those are not great options, but those
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.320]   things only kick in if Amex, Chase, or Capital One learn of the death of the person.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.520]   So I would encourage you, until Chase knows that, yes, if Chase finds that out,
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.000]   they're gonna redeem them for cash. Until they find that out, you can always log in
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.560]   and you can go transfer those to family members accounts. Or you can just redeem
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.480]   them in the portal, or find some way to use them before they get auto-redeemed
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   for cash at a lower value. So Matthew, I really appreciate you sending this
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.800]   question in, because as much as I had thought I was a little bit prepared, I
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.440]   don't think the information of what to do with all these points is documented
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.720]   anywhere. So I'm actually gonna write up a little thing. I'm gonna upload it to
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.600]   our trustworthy account so someone has it in case something happens, and someone
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.960]   knows what actions they need to do with our points to make sure they're not
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.160]   redeemed at half a cent, and hopefully people can take crazy, amazing vacations.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.760]   Kevin wrote in asking about planning a trip to Hawaii with a family of six and
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.360]   his wife's parents. So it sounds like eight people, and wanted to know how to
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.040]   utilize points for a large group, whether it was best to focus on flights or
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.560]   hotels. And honestly, when I first saw his question, I had one instinct. And then a
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.520]   couple days later, I started trying to book a trip for our family, which was
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.920]   gonna require four tickets. And I realized how much different the game is
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.240]   when you're booking four tickets. You know, we're used to trying to use our
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.160]   points to fly internationally in business class, and we couldn't find a
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.960]   single place to go on short notice. Not last-minute notice, but maybe two or
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.040]   three months out, where we could find four business class tickets. I wouldn't
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.440]   say I tried too hard, but the basic things I looked at were pretty hard. So I
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   asked a few friends, and we came to a couple thoughts. One, we just decided that
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.960]   maybe we don't want to travel business class with our kids. Maybe we don't want
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:24.360]   to expose them to those luxuries right away. And that just means that we'll sit
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.080]   in coach also, and it'll be less relaxing and enjoyable for us, but it'll be
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.840]   better for them. And we'll actually be able to find availability, because we
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.800]   have been able to find easier availability for coach seats for a lot
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.600]   of people than we have business class. So that's just one thought. Hotels, if you
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.440]   have a family of six and in-laws, that might be eight flights, but it also might
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.040]   only be three hotel rooms. And I've had a lot more success looking for hotel
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.640]   rooms. So Kevin mentioned he has chase points. I definitely look at whether you
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.960]   could use those chase points at Hyatt. But the other thing I'll point out is
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   that Hawaii, depending on when you're going, can be so cheap that it might not
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.160]   even be worth using your miles, or it might be worth using your points in the
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.360]   portal if you really don't want to spend the money right now. We're going to
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.120]   Hawaii next month in October, and the round-trip tickets were like $250. But
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.520]   when I looked at the miles, it was so much more that it wasn't actually a good
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.600]   deal. So if I'm okay spending money, that's an option. If I'm not, then I would
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   just book in the portal. And I know it's not the best points per mile, but if I
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.100]   was in a circumstance where I didn't have the money to take the trip and I
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.800]   wanted to take the trip, I'm a bigger fan of traveling than maximizing your
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.720]   points. So I would want to do that. So Kevin, good luck. I will keep everyone
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.380]   here also updated as I figure out how we navigate the waters of booking travel
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.440]   with miles for big groups. Four doesn't seem that big, but compared to two
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.800]   people, it seems like a lot more. Another option I'll plug is check out the
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.560]   Straight to the Points newsletter. I'll link it in the show notes. It's a great
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:56.400]   newsletter that shares when there's lots of seats available for different award
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.560]   flights. And so I've gotten a couple alerts there. And as long as you're
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   flexible with where you go, it's a great option to be able to find lots of seats
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   for award travel. Adam wrote in asking, "What are the best Capital One partners
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.160]   to transfer points for a trip across the ocean?" And I thought about it. My favorite
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:19.080]   three Capital One transfer partners for long flights are British Airways, booking
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.240]   anything on One World, which doesn't mean you have to fly British Airways. You
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.880]   could fly Air France, lots of great deals, especially right now. And then Air
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.840]   Canada, I think is a great transfer partner of Capital One to book on United,
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.880]   Air Canada, Lufthansa, Swiss Air. There's a lot of carriers that cross the ocean
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.600]   in Star Alliance. So those are my three favorites for booking international
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.080]   travel with Capital One points. And to be honest, booking domestic travel as well.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.240]   I actually have a transfer partner spreadsheet that I'll link to in the
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   show notes, and I'll put it up at allthehacks.com/tp for transfer
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.680]   partners. And it lists out all the transfer partners of all the major
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.120]   credit card programs. It lists out how long it usually takes for those
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   transfers to go through, what alliance they're in, and then I put a little
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.000]   asterisk next to the ones that are my favorites. So hopefully that's helpful if
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.240]   you have a similar question, but instead of Capital One, you're thinking Chase or
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:14.480]   Citi or Built or American Express. Now, Noam wrote in asking what my stack was
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.360]   for websites and services to make the most out of my points. So I thought I'd
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.760]   talk about it, both the stack of services and then just some quick tips. So when it
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.640]   comes to tracking, I'm aware of three services that help you track how many
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.920]   miles and points you have in different places. Award Wallet is one, the Points
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   Guy app is one, and to no surprise, a Spreadsheet is another. I've struggled
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.240]   with Award Wallet because it's like partially automated and partially
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:47.120]   manual. And then the Points Guy, it's fully automated, but it doesn't support
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.960]   everything. For example, I have some Chase business cards and some Chase personal
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.440]   cards, and I couldn't figure out how to make that work. I couldn't link multiple
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:59.460]   accounts from different airlines to pull in my wife's points. So honestly, Google
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.120]   Spreadsheets is the way I track my points and miles. I know it's old school.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.080]   It's not ideal, but you know, it does the trick. When it comes to searching for
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:12.760]   flights, before you actually go and sign up and use a service, first thing that
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.920]   I'd recommend doing is looking at three websites. And not because you necessarily
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.060]   have points in these programs, but because I think they're the best for
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.340]   searching the three alliances. So Air France for searching SkyTeam flights,
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.240]   British Airways for searching One World flights, or American if you already have
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:35.120]   an account there and you're familiar, and Aeroplan for searching Star Alliance or
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.460]   United if you have an account there. So whenever I'm looking to book an
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.600]   international flight, if I don't want to go use a tool like Point.me, and I'll get
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.080]   to that, I'll just go through those three websites and say, "If I want to go
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.360]   to from San Francisco to Paris, go to Aeroplan. Is there anything there? Go to
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.480]   British Airways. Is there anything there? Go to Air France. Is there anything there?"
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.640]   That's like a quick, free version. Now there are a bunch of tools out there
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:02.920]   that are paid services that help you do this easier. Point.me is one I really
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:07.880]   like. And you can still go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use the
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.800]   promo code "allthehacks" at the checkout on a monthly plan to get the
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.240]   monthly plan down to $1. It's great because you can search across tons of
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.720]   airlines and they'll tell you how to transfer your points to the airlines to
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.600]   find availability. It kind of takes all of that work out. There's another tool I
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   use called ExpertFlyer, but it supports a fewer number of airlines. So I don't
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   necessarily recommend it for that use case, but it is really great for alerts.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.400]   You can set alerts for when things open up, when seats open up. So I use it for
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.320]   that a lot. There are two tools that I haven't used much of, but could be worth
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.120]   checking out. One's called AwardLogic and one's called AwardNexus. I think
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.800]   they're both kind of competitors to Point.me. I think I used AwardNexus a
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.040]   while ago, but I haven't used AwardLogic ever. And last is a tool that is going
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.640]   to make you feel like you're going back in time. And it's called KVS tool. And
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.960]   it's a Windows application that I think has the most versatile search across all
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   airlines and all programs. But it is absolutely the most clunky tool to use.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.080]   And you have to search the airlines individually. It's not a simple thing,
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.640]   but I would say it is the most feature rich tool in terms of being able to find
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.120]   the most availability on the most airlines. It's just an experience. So I
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.680]   definitely throw that out there. I ended up having to install an emulator on my
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.560]   computer when I've used it in the past, but it's almost so much work that I
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   don't think I've used it for two or three years.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:37.760]   The one tool that I think is also in my stack, which I'm so sad that it is no
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.520]   longer getting updated, but it's still about 70% correct, is a website called
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.600]   award mapper. And it's just award mapper.com. And it's a directory of all
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.480]   the hotels across all the different loyalty programs around the world.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.920]   Unfortunately, it's not updated. So there are hotels there that are no longer
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.640]   around or hotels that are new that aren't there or the categories have
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.920]   changed. So it's not perfect, but it's something and I'm hoping someone will
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.160]   replace it or update it in the future. Last question is another one from gnome
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.000]   who asked if he wants to plan for a special occasion, what's the best timing
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.600]   to ensure he gets the best deal? Meaning how far in advance do you want to book
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:18.280]   with your points? So there's really three options here. One is as soon as
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.000]   the schedule opens up. And there's a link in the show notes to an article on
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.280]   upgraded points about when do airlines release award seats. And it varies, but
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.520]   it's all around the one year mark. But there are some interesting hacks here
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:37.120]   where certain airlines release their schedule to certain other partners 365
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.480]   days instead of 330 days out. So you might get a better chance booking those
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.680]   awards if you're booking them from certain partner programs. That article
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.640]   details a lot of that. So I'll leave that there. So if you know far in
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.960]   advance more than a year out, I would say get ready, figure out the day those
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.840]   days are going to open up and book them at that one year out mark and even go as
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:01.120]   far as to book to one ways. So if the schedule opens up, book the outbound and
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.400]   then wait two weeks until you can book the return. If it's a two week trip,
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.320]   most award seats now can be canceled and redeposited. So if it's a really
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.600]   important trip, I would do that. The second option is wait until the last
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.840]   minute. And this could be really daunting for a lot of people. My wife
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.200]   falls into that category at times, but we've taken a handful of trips where
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.960]   we've said this is the week or two we're going to block off. We're going to
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.280]   start looking for flights now. But if we don't find something we're really
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.160]   excited about, we're going to check again. And we've changed where we're
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.480]   going as late as at the airport, you know, a few hours before taking off
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.760]   because availability just opens up like crazy. Now, you don't really have to
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.840]   wait until the day of the flight. Usually it's within the last two weeks
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.120]   when airlines start to open up a lot of their award inventory. And so I would
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:51.520]   say maybe you could book one inconvenient routing or to a place
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.600]   you're excited to go to, but maybe you have a backup place you'd really like
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.640]   to go to more. And then two weeks out, if that other thing is available, you
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.760]   can change your plans or switch from the flight that has two stops and coach
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.040]   to the nonstop in business or something like that. The other option is just
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.840]   whenever you can. Look, if you have flexibility on your side, whether that's
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.520]   where you go or when you go, I think you can find flights to just about
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.120]   anywhere, anytime, whether it's six months out, nine months out, three
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.360]   months out. If it's during the holidays, it's going to be harder, but
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.520]   generally I think it's not impossible. And then the last one is just whenever
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.560]   you see a deal. So I mentioned the straight to the points newsletter
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.240]   earlier, great place where you'll get an email that says, Hey, right now
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:38.280]   there's an amazing deal going on with award availability to X or Y. A few
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.720]   weeks ago, there was amazing availability on Fiji airways in business
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.880]   to fly from the West coast to New Zealand or Fiji or Australia. So that
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.040]   was something that we actually almost jumped on, but it didn't quite work
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.600]   with our schedule. So that would be the other. So it's as soon as it opens
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.160]   up last minute or whenever you see a deal are the optimal times, but I
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.960]   wouldn't let that discourage you. I haven't really ever booked right when
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.240]   the schedule opened up and I've booked lots of things, not last minute when
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.160]   there wasn't a deal. So I wouldn't say anything else is bad. I would just
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.200]   say those are the best times to book. So I also want to share some of the
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   latest deals I've seen in the past few weeks, but first thank you so much
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.840]   to everyone who sent in questions. I love doing these episodes. Like I
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.520]   mentioned earlier, the next one is going to be on everything else, life,
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:28.440]   non points, travel, relationships, kids, career, productivity, really
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.120]   anything. So I would love to include your questions in the next episode.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:36.200]   Please send me an email or maybe one day one of you will go to the website
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.600]   and use the voicemail feature and I'll play your question live in the next
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.760]   episode. As for deals, first off, if you want to get these deals as soon
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.440]   as they come out, I send a newsletter every two weeks and I always put the
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.760]   best deals I find in them. So please subscribe all the hacks.com/email.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.120]   Let's run through what's happening right now. The biggest one is for any
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.160]   of you with an Amex card. Right now there are 15 to 30% bonuses on
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:06.040]   transfers to 12 different Amex transfer partners. That's nine different
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.760]   airlines, including a few I love like Aeroplan, British Airways and Air
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.640]   France, but a bunch of others as well. So if you're thinking about booking a
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.880]   trip using any Amex points now would be one of the best times to do it
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.560]   because there is a bonus on almost every transfer you could want to do.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:25.920]   Also, if you have the built rewards card, you can now earn three X points
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.560]   on gas or EV charging until October 31st, which is awesome. If you don't
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.520]   have the built card, I talked about it earlier. Amex is running a bonus for
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.320]   business checking accounts where you get 30,000 free Amex points for
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.240]   depositing $5,000 in an account and making a few transactions. Chase has
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:48.280]   just turned on referring a friend for the Sapphire Reserve card. So if
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.640]   you're looking to earn some extra points and you have a Sapphire Reserve
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.840]   or a Sapphire Preferred card, you can get 10 to 15,000 chase points for
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.640]   referring your friend. And finally, there's a deal where you can get
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.880]   2,500 free Wyndham points from BACT. It's a new app. All of these deals are
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.840]   in my most recent newsletter, which I will link to in the show notes. There
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.240]   are also two deals that expired, but I figured I'll share them here just so
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.640]   you get a sense of what's in the newsletter. Last Saturday was National
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.920]   Cinema Day, so there were $3 tickets at movie theaters nationwide. And
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.760]   Southwest had 25% off flights to all beach destinations, Hawaii, Mexico,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.280]   Caribbean, and Central America. So that's the kind of stuff you'll see in
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.080]   the newsletter. I hope you subscribe and I hope you enjoy it. And please,
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.040]   feedback is always welcome. All right. I know we hit on a ton of questions.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.160]   Thank you so much for joining for this episode. These are some of my
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   favorites. Do send questions for the next one and I will do my best to
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.360]   answer them in a future episode. That is it for this week. I will see you
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.000]   next week.
