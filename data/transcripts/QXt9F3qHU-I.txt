[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   All right, we have a question here from Lira.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Lira says, "How do you deal with unexpected overload
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.780]   and burnout that you can't really ease?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.920]   I'm a 26 year old Spanish ESL teacher
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.480]   and nutrition student from Spain.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.680]   I've been working at an academy teaching English part-time
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.840]   for the last year and a half.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960]   I'm also finishing my degree project
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.920]   for university from home and working at a bookstore
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.480]   owned by family members.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.520]   Due to the owner having an unexpected illness,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.160]   my hours at the store have doubled
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.200]   and I have to work for another three months,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.280]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.200]   Now I get up very early to work on my project
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.280]   before working at the store all morning.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.540]   I'm feeling burnt out, I'm not well rested,
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000]   and I'm feeling stressed most of the time.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400]   I time block and keep to-do lists
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.900]   and I assign specific days and times,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.240]   plan my days so I can fit everything
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.960]   and have started quarterly planning since September,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.160]   which does help keep my eye on my goals
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.220]   and figure out the next steps,
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.800]   but this does not help with burnout.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.280]   Could it be I'm simply adjusting to the increased workload
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.720]   and what would you recommend?
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.600]   Well, Lyra, first of all, I understand the state you're in.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480]   I get there often myself,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.420]   where I have a lot of things on my plate.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.580]   Because I'm very organized, I can make it fit.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.760]   So it's not like things are being left behind
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   or I'm scrambling to stay up all night long
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.280]   to try to get deadlines on.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.800]   It's not that type of stress
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.840]   of I don't have enough time to get things done,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600]   but it's exhausting.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.720]   Every minute is scheduled right up to a shutdown.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.140]   You feel like there's no gaps in that time block schedule,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.800]   your full intensity all day long.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   I find that exhausting
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   and that's exactly the situation you're in.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.520]   And you're exhausting, A, because of just constant labor.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   That's just physically draining
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.480]   day after day after day to do that.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.440]   It's just draining.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.640]   It also, at least this is my theory,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.160]   short circuits the planning centers of our brain,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.120]   which aren't used to having so many things on our plate.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.960]   Yes, with artificial help and tools
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   like multi-scale planning, we can make it work,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.840]   but our brain doesn't really know about that.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.440]   And so it can't wrap its mind
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.220]   about all the different stuff on your plate.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.240]   And so it's freaked out about it.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240]   How are we gonna get this all done?
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.900]   It's used to a slower pace of execution.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.040]   So you're straight up exhausted
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   and you have the negative effect
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960]   of this planning center short circuiting.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.360]   That's why you feel burnout.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.000]   So here's the cure.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740]   Do fewer things, take more breaks.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.940]   That means one of these things going on in your life,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700]   you're gonna have to pause or stop.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.060]   Now, I think you know that this is the answer.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220]   And the reason why I think you know this is the answer
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.020]   is that in the full version of your question,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.700]   I condensed this, but in the full version of your question,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.500]   you were very careful around each of the things
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.220]   you introduced that was drawn from your time
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.240]   to put these disclaimers that explained why
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   there wasn't more blood to squeeze from that turn up.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.800]   There wasn't, you didn't have options to make it easier.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.840]   You didn't have options to make it more flexible,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.920]   to spread it out more like this is this demands,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560]   I can't change it.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   You said that for each of the things.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   So you were preemptively trying to sidestep an answer
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.160]   that was like with a little bit more organization,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.280]   with a little bit more savvy in how you lay things out,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.360]   maybe things will feel better.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   Because I think you knew the answer was,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   that's not gonna solve it.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.560]   There's too much raw stuff on my plate,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.840]   and it's exhausting me.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.400]   And you were looking for permission for me
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.900]   to take things off your plate.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.160]   And I'm giving you that permission right now.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.340]   We have a hard time with this,
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.280]   taking things off our plate.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.240]   Especially those of us like you, Lira,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.600]   who are driven and ambitious and interesting
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.640]   and doing interesting stuff.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.480]   All these things you're doing
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.840]   are either interesting or admirable.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.680]   You're helping your family, you're getting a degree,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.560]   you're working on a big project.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.120]   And we feel bad about taking stuff away.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.600]   But let me tell you, when you zoom out
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.440]   and look at these pictures,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.960]   in the big scale, it's not a big deal.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.280]   You're going through a period of,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.520]   you said three more months where you have to take extra
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.080]   shifts at a bookstore to help your family.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.160]   Okay, that's nice.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.420]   So maybe you need to delay the nutrition degree
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.760]   by a semester.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.960]   Or not do your project yet.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   And say, look, we have this family thing going on,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.000]   I have to help out.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.280]   In the big picture, what's gonna,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   it's not gonna matter.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.940]   You're gonna get your degree,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.780]   you're gonna finish your project,
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.620]   you helped your family,
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.080]   you spread this out by another six months,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.280]   it's not a big deal.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.200]   But in the moment, it feels like failure.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   Because stepping back, adding things makes us feel good.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   Hey, look how admirable and ambitious I am.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.760]   I'm doing all these interesting things.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.160]   Stepping back from things makes us feel bad,
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.480]   or like something bad is happening.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.220]   Or like there was a failure.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.000]   And we amplify in our mind how much other people
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440]   are gonna care when we do that.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.620]   Reality check, they don't,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.660]   they're thinking about themselves,
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.600]   they're barely gonna notice.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.760]   I used to encounter this in a dramatic way
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.440]   when I was a grad student at MIT.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.960]   And I was writing student books,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.840]   and I was advising, informally advising undergraduates
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   to help them apply my advice to their lives.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.880]   And the trade-off was,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.520]   I would then write about them on my blog,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.280]   anonymously, or shoot anonymously.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.520]   But I would like, let me help you get your life in order
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.600]   as a student, and then let me write about it.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.400]   I had a series on my blog called College Chronicles
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.200]   back then, where I'd write about it.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   And I remember I would come across students,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.280]   and there was one in particular,
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.440]   I remember this one student, and I called her Lena.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.280]   It's not a real name, but I called her Lena.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.080]   She was at MIT, and she was an undergraduate.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.400]   And she had all this stuff on her plate,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.360]   because she was so ambitious.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.080]   Her family and her school back home were so proud.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.040]   She got to MIT, and she didn't wanna let 'em down,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.360]   so she had three majors in all these clubs.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.880]   And she was the person everyone was always impressed by.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.000]   And the only lever she knew how to pull
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.320]   to increase impressiveness was quantity.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.760]   Quantity of activities, but she was having trouble.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.200]   And so I worked with her.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.760]   I said, "Let's look at all of your obligations
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.160]   "and figure out how much time they need each week,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.840]   "and let's try to figure out a schedule,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.120]   "a student autopilot schedule.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.560]   "We can make time for each of these things,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.400]   "so it's automatic.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.620]   "Tuesday at this time, I work on my problem set.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.520]   "Wednesday after dinner, I'm at this club meeting."
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.120]   We did this exercise, and we ran out of time.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.200]   Even if she worked every hour of the day,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.760]   from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.720]   she still couldn't get all the work done,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.520]   even in a normal week where there wasn't
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.100]   extra exams or projects due.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.620]   I said, "This is black and white, Lena.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.680]   "You have to quit things.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.860]   "You have to stop doing three majors.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.900]   "You can't do all these clubs.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.240]   "You literally don't have time."
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800]   Black and white.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.760]   She couldn't do it.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.480]   She couldn't do it, because to quit something
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.560]   or walk away from something would be her
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.360]   stepping away from accomplishment,
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.680]   stepping away from ambition, it'd be letting people down.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.880]   And I've told this story before,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.640]   but what happened to Lena was she burnt out
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.120]   and had to take a leave of absence,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.560]   a medical leave of absence for mental health issues.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.400]   Prider Brain.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.880]   So I understand the difficulty here,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040]   but this is me telling you and giving you the permission
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.540]   I think that you want from me.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.520]   Do less.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.600]   Spread it out.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.840]   Give yourself a break.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.520]   Give yourself breathing room.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.840]   You're young.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.920]   None of this is incredibly time-sensitive.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.300]   When you look back 10 years from now,
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.200]   you're not even gonna know the difference
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.040]   between getting all this done in the next three months
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.520]   and spending eight months instead.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.440]   But in the moment, it's gonna be night and day.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   There's gonna be the difference between
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.040]   physical breakdown and exhaustion
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.560]   and all of the things that can lead to
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   depression, deep procrastination, health issues.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.880]   It's gonna be the difference between that
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.000]   and actually having some autonomy, control,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.600]   gratitude, and depth in life.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.880]   So that's what I'm gonna say, Lyra.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   Do less.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.860]   I give you permission.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.780]   Quit the way.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.940]   It's not retreating from your ambition.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.380]   It's tackling it in a way that's gonna be sustainable
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.580]   in the long term.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.000]   (upbeat music)
