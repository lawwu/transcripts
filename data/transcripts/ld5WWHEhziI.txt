[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   So it is the holiday season, and even though on the show we often talk about productivity in the
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.000]   age of distractions, one of the things that this particular season is known for is overload.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.440]   This is a topic that I think is as worth talking about as how to get more done. So what should
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.240]   your immediate next steps be when you get hit by that sinking feeling that you have taken on
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   more than you could possibly reasonably accomplish? That's what I want to discuss today.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.720]   I have three concrete ideas, each follows one after the other, 1, 2, 3, that I should suggest
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.640]   that you deploy in response to overload, whether this is overload in your professional life or your
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.080]   personal life, something that can deliver relief right away and help make sure that this type of
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.800]   overload becomes less common in the future. So I have three concrete steps to offer to you about
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.480]   how to get through overload. But first we should take a moment to understand why overload in the
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.880]   first place is so hard to avoid. Why is it something that even when we're conscientious
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.200]   and we use Cal Newport style systems for organization and planning, why do we still
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.800]   find ourselves at times like the holiday season with too much to do? I want to do a brief bit
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.600]   of theory here. I'm going to, for those who are watching instead of listening, I'm going to draw
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.000]   this beautifully on the screen. This is a chart, right? Because I'm a scientist here. So I'm going
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   to draw a chart here. We have a y-axis and an x-axis. I'm actually going to label this chart.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.440]   So let's label the y-axis, the vertical axis here. I'm going to put, let's see here,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.040]   obligations. That's pretty small. And then I'm going to put on the x-axis time. All right. So
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   what am I going to do with this chart? Well, what most people have, whether they know about it or
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.120]   not, is a limit. And I'm drawing this as a dashed line going across the chart here. They have a
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.520]   limit for how much obligations they can be dealing with at the same time without feeling overloaded.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:23.280]   So we'll even label that here. We'll call this Max Obligations. This is crude, but gives us the
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.520]   general idea. We have a maximum of obligations we can handle before we begin to naturally feel
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   kind of overloaded. The actual position of this line on the y-axis, so the number of obligations
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.800]   you can handle before feeling overloaded, this has to do in part with what type of work we're
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.760]   talking about. It also has in part to do with your particular personality. Some people like me are
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.920]   very attuned to overload. It really stresses us out. Other people feed off of it a little bit more,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.880]   but that line exists for most people. Now, here's the problem. We have a broken mental model
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.400]   for how overload actually operates. Most people think here's what you do. You select a workload
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.320]   and you want it to be close to but below the max obligations. So maybe I'm putting a red line here
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.200]   across. You say, yeah, I'll just make my workload here. Keep it steady over time right below that
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.600]   max obligations dotted line threshold. So I'll be getting a lot done without feeling overloaded.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   The reason why this doesn't work is that in reality,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:29.120]   your obligation count is like a giant super tanker on the ocean, right? When you get it moving in a
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   given direction, you can't just stop it on time. You can't just stop where you are and make a quick
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.040]   turn. If you want to start turning, you're going to slide for a long time in one direction until
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.280]   you can finally turn the directions. If you want to stop because you don't want to hit an iceberg
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.720]   in front of you, it could take you, and I've seen these numbers before, miles before that big mass
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.680]   comes to a complete stop. So you get moved in a direction that takes a lot of time, even after
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.120]   you want to change it for you to move back in the other direction. As a result, when you try to keep
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.560]   your obligations around a certain level, what you're going to get is oscillations above and
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.000]   below. So I'm going to draw this. I'll draw this here. I'm going to select another color. I'll use
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.520]   black. All right, so I'm going to draw this here. I guess I'll use orange. It becomes something more
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840]   like this. So if you're watching this instead of just listening, you'll see I have an oscillating
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.120]   sort of sine curve that is going above where you're trying to keep it, then it falls below.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.320]   So what's really happening here is that when you realize you have too many obligations,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   you start to try to pull back, but it takes a while, and more stuff comes in, and you get much
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.160]   higher than you want to be. And then finally you go too far in the other direction, you fall lower
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.680]   than you need to be. So you start bringing stuff on, and you go higher than you want to be. And
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.280]   if we look at this here, we see there are these points above our max obligation line, periods of
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   overload. This is difficult to deal with. Now one thing you could do is say, okay, I'll recognize
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:04.160]   this reality, and I will build my wave. I'll start it lower. I'll have my target lower so that my
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.760]   peaks stay below my max obligation line. So I drew another curve here that's trying to indicate that.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.280]   You could do that, but here's the problem. In order to keep your peaks below your max
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.560]   obligation line, look at these valleys now. These are really low. So if you're trying to make sure
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.920]   that you never have too much to do, you're going to have, at a frequent point, way too little to do.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.760]   This might be so little to do that it's very notable. Your boss is like, "What's going on
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   here?" Your clients aren't getting service. You're not making enough money. The stuff in your
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.400]   household that just has to get done, not all of it is getting done. So in order to average ourself
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.560]   around a reasonable area, it feels like overload can be somewhat inevitable. So I think that's
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.360]   what's going on from a theoretical perspective. That's why it's difficult to avoid overload while
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.040]   still feeling like you're being reasonably productive. So what do we do about it? Well,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.200]   I have three steps to recommend. These feed off each other. One after another, you do them in
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:12.160]   this order. Step number one, reduce what you can right away. So you have that moment of, "Oh my
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.640]   God, I have too much on my plate. I'm stressed out." Typically, this comes after you're confronting
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.080]   some reality of your calendar. You're like, "My God, how am I going to get this all done? I feel
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.440]   so busy." To get some relief right away, say, "What can I take off my plate?" And it doesn't
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.920]   have to be related to the final thing that pushed you over the edge. You say, "Where can I simplify
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.960]   here?" Well, look, I agreed to volunteer at this thing. They have a lot of volunteers. It's going
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.080]   to take up a lot of time. This is eating up a whole afternoon. I'm going to step out of that.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.480]   I have some social plans that on paper sound good because I want to see these people,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.840]   but it means it's going to be five nights in a row where I'm going out and doing things.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.120]   So I'm going to actually cancel this social plan. I'm going to cancel that social plan.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.760]   I agreed to help with this on work, among other things. I'm going to say I have to step back from
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.680]   that. I'm sorry. I apologize. I just have too much on my plate. I just agreed to give a talk
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.920]   yesterday. Let me pull back and say, "Actually, I know we just talked about that, but I wasn't
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.400]   looking at my schedule right." I'm going to try to push a meeting. I have a meeting with someone
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.920]   that's going to require me to travel halfway across the city. It's really not that urgent.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.680]   It made sense at the time when I scheduled it because the calendar was empty, but now that
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.480]   I'm there, I have much more intractable things. So you begin to reduce what you can reduce.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.560]   Move, cancel, defer just to earn yourself a little bit more breathing room.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.840]   A lot of people skip this step because there's almost a morality to being the person that's
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.160]   always there and always doing things and can handle the busyness. So we have this sense of
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.200]   pulling back is somehow a failure or a moral mark upon us, but it really isn't. It's just
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   the reality of this sine wave up and down nature of work that sometimes when the sine wave pops
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.800]   above, we have to start pulling it back down right away to keep things reasonable.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.840]   So if you're doing this with care and in response to overload and not laziness,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.440]   not procrastination, but in terms of, "I need to pull down my workload," it is the right first step.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.000]   All right, step number two, systematize the workload that remains. So, okay, here's what
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   I have to do after I've simplified what I can. I now need a plan for how this work is going to get
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   done. Having a plan for how the work is going to get done does not reduce the amount of work you
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.200]   have to do. It does not even reduce the total number of hours when you add it up, you spend
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   on the work, but it can make the psychological experience of facing and executing this work
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.160]   much improved. So instead of just randomly throwing a lot of hours of what remains,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.960]   here are some ideas here. Look ahead on your calendar for however long this period of
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.840]   overload is lasting and start blocking out the work. When is this going to get done?
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.360]   I'm going to start putting aside time. This is what I'm going to be working on this conference.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.040]   This is what I'm going to do, the gift shopping that is starting to stress me out. Maybe there's
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.680]   an administrative load you have because you agreed to help organize an event and it's just generating
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.920]   more and more back and forth emails and crises and you autopilot schedule 35 minutes every morning.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.440]   Nothing but work on that, like really thinking through process centric emails,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.600]   not just shooting things off of your inbox, but really thinking through here's what I think we
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.200]   should do. Here's the steps. Here's the next thing you should do. Don't just respond to me in email.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.160]   You're working on it every single day, autopilot it. So you have some autopilot scheduling going
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   on for the things that happen. Add big blocks into your calendar that you might not normally have.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   I think we talked about this in, this might've been the episode we did with Laura Vanderkam,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.920]   where she talked about, it was an assistant professor who was working, feeling overloaded
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.160]   because of her schedule, working towards tenure. And one of the things she realized is like, oh,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:05.200]   I could hire childcare for work coverage. Hey, quick interruption. If you want my free guide
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.840]   with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go to calnewport.com/ideas
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.760]   or click the link right below in the description. This is a great way to take action on the type of
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.440]   things we talk about here on this show. All right, let's get back to it. That would enable me on a
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.960]   regular basis, at least during this period, to get in a really large block of work that I otherwise
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.520]   would not be able to do. So in this particular example, the issue was it was a day in which this
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.880]   professor, it was her turn, not her husband's that pick up her kids from elementary school at three,
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.920]   but it was a day in which she was done with her teaching by 12. And she realized a babysitter that
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.840]   picks up the kids and takes them till six means six unbroken hours on those days that she could
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.400]   really make progress on something. So think about how you can add new blocks, large blocks to your
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.200]   schedule by doing a little bit extra, putting in a little bit of extra effort to protect time.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.960]   And this is, you know, hiring childcare or making a deal with your partner. Sunday mornings,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.400]   I need a four hour block on Sunday mornings. Let's figure out something to do with the kids.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.640]   So you add in the time you need. So you're proactively making a plan for how is this work
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.920]   going to get done? And by blocking time in advance, generating more time and putting in autopilots for
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.640]   the ongoing work, more and more of this gets executed without you just in a stressful manner,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.280]   trying to find hours late at night or early in the morning and getting feeling worse about it.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:39.120]   It really is. There's an immediate stress reduction impact. Once you have this plan in
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.840]   place, even before you've done any of the work, because your mind says we have a plan. This makes
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.160]   sense. I can go back to thinking about whatever. I don't have to have this as a background hum of
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.560]   anxiety that's added on top of the actual stress of doing the work. So step one, just reduce what
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.080]   you can from your schedule right away to get some breathing room. Step two, have a systematic plan
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.960]   for how the heavy work that remains is going to be executed in this period of overload.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.440]   And then step three, and this is one that is often missed and it surprises some people,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.520]   but it works really well. Plan to prevent similar overload in the future.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   So right now as you're facing an overload period, before you even make significant progress into
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.240]   that overload, you spend some time thinking through how do I make sure this doesn't happen
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:41.040]   so frequently in the future? It seems like at first, isn't this a waste of time? Shouldn't you
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.280]   just be working on the stuff you need to do? Why would you waste time thinking through new systems
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.000]   and plans for the more distant future to prevent overload in the future? And the answer is it's a
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.040]   huge psychological boost. I face this hardship, but you know what? I have some ideas now about
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.520]   how to prevent this type of overload from happening so often in the future. Makes you feel better
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:09.360]   about the overload you face right now. And makes it feel like you have efficacy. I'm in charge of
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   the situation. I can make progress. Yeah, this is going to maybe suck a little bit for the next
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.240]   three weeks, but I feel better about it knowing that it's probably not going to happen again
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.800]   after that for a while because I have, I've learned from it. How did I get in the situation?
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.480]   What can I put in place to help minimize similar overloads in the future?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Now, before we get into the specifics of how do you prevent overloads in the future,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.040]   let's return briefly to my diagram from before, because you might be saying, Cal, you said, look,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:46.880]   work oscillates. You can't keep your workload easily as just a straight line. It oscillates
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.720]   up and down. So how are we going to have any success trying to reduce overload in the future?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.600]   Well, the things I'm going to explain to you now, it's not about stopping the oscillation. What it
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.280]   is, is going to be about squeezing the space between the top and the bottom. So what you can
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.320]   do, and this is a great time to do it when you feel overload in the moment, is figure out how
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.640]   do I get those oscillations tighter? So the overload is not as bad, or perhaps I can actually
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:23.360]   fit underneath the limit without my troughs being too low. So how do we squeeze the amplitude of
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:32.880]   this workload sinuous curve? Well, here's a few ideas. One, quotas. Certain type of work that you
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.360]   need to do as part of your position, but that you have an unlimited supply of this work coming in.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   So at some point, you're going to have to say, no, you decide in advance what your limit is.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.760]   This is very common with college professors with, for example, peer review. Something you need to
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.880]   do. You can't just say, I don't do peer review as a college professor. At a certain level, you will
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   have more requests to do peer review than you have time to do. So you might as well set the quota on
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.160]   your own terms. Four papers per semester. When I hit that quota, I tell people I've hit my quota
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.560]   for the semester. So I can't do this review right now. You're still doing the thing that's important,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   but you are controlling the appropriate level given what's going on. So you might think about
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.120]   quotas on regular work you have, events you agree to help organize, client lunches you agree to go
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.680]   do. This is a very good excuse to surround a no, because you're explaining, I like doing this work.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.640]   I know it's important. I have a limit for how much I do per unit of time, per semester, per
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.440]   quarter, wherever you, whatever's relevant to where you work. I'm past that already. It's a
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.560]   very hard thing for people to push back against because they would have to say your quotas wrong.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   You should be doing more of this. And often quotas are very reasonable. So it's a very reasonable way
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   to say no. Another thing you can consider doing, especially when you feel like there's a lot of
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.440]   incoming that's novel. This is not work I normally do. I don't have a great instinct for how much
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:00.640]   time it's going to take, but I feel pressured to say yes, is future time blocking. This is something
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.720]   I talk about a little bit, I believe in the introduction to my time block planner, or I talk
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.240]   about the discipline, but it's a very powerful tool. Or what you do is for when new things are
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   coming in, you say, I'm going to go and block in advance on my calendar. So it's like I'm time
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.520]   blocking days that are still way in the future when this work is going to get done. I could be
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.240]   crude. You don't have to be super precise, but you're like, I don't know. I figure I'm going to
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.600]   need five or six long sessions to actually write this report I'm about to agree to do. Let me go
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.760]   find and block those two to three hour sessions, five or six of them in the next three weeks.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.680]   I'm going to put them on my calendar. You can mess around with that schedule when you actually
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.200]   get to the week. But what you're doing is saying, I need to actually find and identify enough time
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.960]   in my future to actually do this. Now, the advantage of future time blocking is that
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.560]   pretty soon you see when you don't have enough time to get something done, it makes the
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.400]   unreasonability of your workload obvious because you're starting to have a hard time finding the
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.320]   time in the weeks ahead to block off to actually accomplish what needs to be accomplished.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.960]   And it gives you a really clear indicator of, okay, I should say,
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.880]   no, I don't have the time. I'm looking at my calendar, keep very careful track of my time.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.840]   I can actually easily find the time for this. So something has to go, or I have to say no to this.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.880]   Now, future time blocking is not something you want to do for everything all the time,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.840]   right? You don't want to be building a time specific schedule in advance for every obligation.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.360]   But if you do this for a while, especially during times where you fear overload,
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.560]   it protects you during that period. But more importantly, it trains you.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:39.680]   You gain a better understanding of how long things take and how much time you actually
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.360]   have free once you factor in these standing meetings, I usually have to do this and that.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.480]   And after a while, when you get to these potentially busy or overloaded periods,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.840]   you don't actually have to do the future time blocking because you just have a good instinct.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.800]   I know how much this type of thing takes. I have a good feel for what the month ahead looks like.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.360]   I know I don't have time now. You become a sort of time allocation scheduling ninja in the sense
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.080]   of I just have this really good instinct for what's going on in my calendar.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:14.560]   You can also have automatic no list. Definitely people in the public eye like myself have this.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.480]   These are things I just automatically say no to. I don't even have to think about it.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.640]   You can also practice hard nos. If you are going to say no, just say no. You can be apologetic,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.800]   but don't give wiggle room. Don't say, I don't think I can do this. But I mean,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.560]   you know, I mean, unless like we could find a way to work it around, or maybe there's somewhere else,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.400]   some other way can be helpful in organizing this, then people just go right back around
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.440]   and throw a bunch of work on your plate anyways. If you're going to say no,
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.760]   give people the courtesy of a hard no, so they know to move on.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:53.360]   Consider having a default of deferred yeses. So even if you think you are going to say yes
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   to something, or you're not sure, but you have to get back to someone,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.400]   say, look, that sounds interesting. Let me get back to you on Monday. That's when I go over my
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.240]   schedule and plan, and I'll see what's going on. I'll get back to you.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.400]   It's an easy response to have, because you're not saying no to someone in the moment.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:17.360]   It also shows and signals to the other person that you are a conscientious scheduler. You know what's
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.160]   going on with your time, that you're responsible and reliable. So you've planted that seed,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.920]   and you've bought yourself some breathing room. This breathing room gives you a few different
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.800]   things. One, it just allows you to escape the social pressure of the moment, which says people
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.960]   want some sort of positive response. I don't want to disappoint people. You've given a non-disappointing
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:41.360]   response. Now you can get some space away from that acute feeling of social pressure and more
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.800]   clinically say, do I really have time to do this? At a time where you don't feel like in the moment,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   I just want to make this person feel good. That sounds silly, but it's a really strong effect.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.360]   We mind read, we mind simulate. When that email is there in your inbox, it says, "Hey,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.040]   can you come give this talk?" You're simulating the mind in that moment of the person who sent
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   you that email. When you consider writing no, you imagine that mind being disappointed and upset in
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.880]   you. That's a very powerful force. So if you have to respond to that email, it's going to bias you
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.040]   towards a positive response. So if you instead say, "Oh, this sounds great, but let me get back
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.440]   to you on Monday after my planning," you're not simulating their mind being disappointed. They're
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.920]   like, "Great, we'll hear from them on Monday." Then later, when you're away from that inbox and
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.640]   that simulation of the mind of the sender has completed, you're now able to analyze this much
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.080]   more clinically. "Oh, I don't really have time for that. That's not a good time."
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.360]   Second, because you have planted the seed that I'm a conscientious scheduler, when you do get
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.320]   back to them on Monday, if the decision is, I don't have time for it, they take that seriously.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   It does not seem knee-jerk. This seems like someone who knows about their schedule and
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.720]   don't have time for this. So it's much harder for them to say, "Well, can't you just do it?"
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.560]   Because that's a repudiation of your demonstrated ability to actually control your schedule.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.520]   So deferred yeses is a great way to... You could have a whole, by the way, just column of this in
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.680]   your Trello board for the relevant roles. Deferred yeses, get back to people, next planning meeting.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.240]   It's a great way to just sort of break free of the social pressures, give yourself some space,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.800]   signal your conscientiousness, and make much more intelligent decisions.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.120]   The final thing you can think about when you're in this mode of, "How can I prevent this type
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   of overload from happening again?" is bigger shifts. We don't enough think about work positions
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.600]   in terms of the controllability of workload. There's a lot of things we use to measure the
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:39.280]   desirability of work positions. The two most obvious ones being content of the work. This
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.320]   is probably, in the American context, the most dominant way we judge work. Does this match my
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:52.240]   "passion"? Do I like the sound of this job or working in this position or the eliteness of
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.360]   this position? So we put a lot on the content of the work. What is the job itself? What field is
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.400]   it in? We put a lot of emphasis on that. We also put a lot of emphasis in location too. All right,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.560]   so where is this? Is this a part of the country that I want to live? But there's other things
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.840]   you should care about too. Things that have a huge impact on your day-to-day subjective well-being and
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.240]   workload controllability could be that. So maybe it's the case that this job, it's hard to subdue
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.480]   the sine waves, the up and down movement of workloads. I'm constantly above my workload max
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:30.400]   and it's just the way this job works. Take that seriously as a signal for maybe I need to shift
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.560]   my position within this company or within this field or into another field. Take the pain of
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:43.120]   overload seriously. So doing this planning in the moment for the future makes you feel better about
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.480]   the present because the present becomes attractable. I'm going to get through this. I have
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.840]   my plan, I reduce things, and I've made steps to prevent this from happening again. If you don't
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   make those steps to help prevent it from happening as often again, you can feel, to use motivational
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.040]   psychological terms, that the locus of control has shifted towards the extrinsic, that you have
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.320]   no control over this negative thing. It's not doing hard things that bothers us. It's the sense
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.880]   of I can't control this hard thing from happening and it's going to keep happening. That bothers us.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:19.760]   That's what leads us to burnout. That's what leads us to just giving up. This notion of this is hard
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.040]   and it's arbitrary and it's just going to keep happening again and again. That breaks our spirit.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   They're like, "This is hard. I've fixed it so this won't happen as much. So let's just get
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.120]   through this now." That we can do. You give me weights in the gym and an exercise plan I've
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:41.280]   created. Yeah, it's hard to lift weights, but I know why I'm doing it and I feel motivated.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.200]   You instead just put a lot of heavy stuff on the path from my parking space to the building and
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.640]   I'm just always having to move this stuff. I'm just going to get really frustrated about it.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   I mean, that's a secret way to get people stronger, Jesse. You have to do Olympic lifts
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.280]   to get into the building. So those are my three ways. Those are my three responses.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.040]   Overload is hard to avoid because of the reality of work, but if you have a good response,
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.480]   it could be better. So let's just summarize. Reduce everything you can right away. So just
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.320]   find a breathing room where you can get it so you can take deeper breaths. Two, build a systematic
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.480]   plan for the overload work that remains. It doesn't reduce the hours, but it does reduce
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.960]   the footprint of it. And three, even before you get started, help making a plan to prevent this
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.880]   scale of overload from happening again. Compress the highs and lows of that workload count sine
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.600]   wave that we drew before. You do those three things. It's a pretty strong response to overload.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.720]   You know, I mean, sometimes it's about how do I get more done? Sometimes it's about how do I get
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.520]   through the period when I have too much that I have to do? This seemed like the right time of
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.960]   year to talk about that second piece. So dealing with the negative I think can be just as important
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:54.480]   as trying to seek out more positives. What's an example of a plan that you put in place to
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.600]   prevent overload during the holiday season, like in years prior? Well, I know for example,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:08.000]   in personal life, I have a pretty early set schedule in which we're dealing with gifts
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.800]   because we have not just the standard holiday gifts, but birthdays, two kids' birthdays that
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   fall right around the beginning of the holiday period as well. It's a lot of stuff. And so we
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   start very early. I figured this out a long time ago is like you're way early. You're buying,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.120]   here's the birthday gifts, here's Christmas gifts, you know, by the time you get to December,
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.520]   you're done. So I kind of figured out how to not have that just be something that was
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:47.360]   hanging overhead. It was going to cause a lot of stress. I often try to be careful about the two
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:55.120]   weeks or so I have after Georgetown's academic schedule ends and the end of break, being really
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:01.200]   careful about not scheduling talks or trips or things that require me to go somewhere or do
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.760]   something professionally. We do a lot of social things. I see a lot of friends. I see a lot of
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   movie, like that type of stuff. Yeah. Like that's the emphasis, but like, I'm not going to,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.560]   let's not do, I'm going to come to your office or like, let's have, like get to know you meetings.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.840]   I try to keep that period because I've learned keeping that period light on those appointments
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.400]   is psychologically easier as I'm finishing up other things. So those things work well.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:30.240]   Definitely the deferred yes strategy has been very helpful. And again, everyone should just
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.040]   have in the, if you're using Trello, just have a column in each context. If you have one for,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.120]   you know, waiting to discuss for different meetings, just have one waiting to get back
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.960]   to people after next planning. And just on Mondays, you just go through those and get
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.000]   back to people. That, that space is so important, especially if people corner you, Hey, Jesse,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.520]   like grab you in the hallway. Can you, can you do this for me? Like, Ooh, tell me about it. That
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.640]   sounds great. Let me get back to you on Monday. That's when I do my planning. I'll see if I have
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   time that, that one has been a new addition to my playbook. That really makes a difference.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.360]   Something I have to do. This is more unique. I think to my, the, the part of my professional
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.600]   life, that's more public facing at a certain level. And this is very common. It's something
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.000]   that people have to do at some point after a certain level, because of the volume of incoming
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.120]   is the notion of an automatic. No list includes a, an automatic, no reply.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   Like it, you just, at, at some point, there's a lot of communication that comes to you,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.960]   that gets around the filters that really the best thing to do is not to reply.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.640]   You know, and it, it, I re I had a hard time with this when I first got to that level of
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   sort of public notoriety, but you get to a point eventually where there's certain things where
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.720]   people are just asking you for things. And what about this? And can't we talk about this? Where
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.600]   really the right thing to do for them and you is just not to reply. They actually are sort of just
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.200]   throwing a dart out there. Hey, maybe this will work. They like to start a conversation, kind of
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.280]   gives them false hope and it takes up your time, but that's a place where you have to build pretty
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.720]   clear filters. What falls under this threshold of like, it's probably best. I just don't reply to
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.040]   this versus, you know, let me get into it. Most people don't have that, but if you're public
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.800]   facing at all, or you're a, I learned this originally from prominent MIT professors had
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.600]   to do this where you just, you have to figure out where this threshold is of, um, public incoming
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.880]   that you respond to and public incoming where it's better for everyone just not to reply.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:28.640]   So I've been learning. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. Every time I have a new book come out. So like
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.960]   right now the book coming out in March, we're starting to do publicity preparation and reach,
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.880]   reach out to people I know who have like big podcasts and stuff like that. But it's interesting
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.320]   to see, cause I've known a lot of these people, these are like big names now, but I've known them
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   for a long time and their shows are just getting bigger and they're getting bigger. So it's
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.480]   interesting to observe book by book, how just the experience of talking to them and trying to see
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.000]   if we can set something up, how it changes as they just get bigger and the incoming gets really
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.280]   more and more and you really notice it and what it comes down to and trying to just, you know, where
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.000]   three years ago, it might've just been like a text, like, Hey, when can I come on your show?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.520]   And like, yeah, whenever you want to do it now, it's like a whole thing. Like
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.240]   eventually, you know, it's, you know, the publicist are involved, there's teams and it's,
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:22.160]   you know, um, it's interesting to observe people I know get famous, sir. Yeah. It's just the moats
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.440]   get wider and the passages in get narrower, which I, it's just completely unavoidable.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.840]   Completely unavoidable. Oh, well. All right. So we, uh, as we usually do, we, we have some
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   questions coming up from, uh, real listeners that deal with people, uh, that have these concrete
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:48.400]   issues. But before we, uh, before we get to those questions, let us first hear from our sponsors.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:56.080]   So I want to talk first about our long time friends at Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.800]   enables you to understand the most important things from over 5,500 nonfiction books and
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   podcasts in just 15 minutes. They offer you these summaries called blinks that you can either read
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.240]   or listen to from the Blinkist app on all of these popular nonfiction books and podcasts.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.760]   This allows you to get the big ideas fast. So why would you want to do this? Well, there's a lot of
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   different ways that people use Blinkist, but the way Jesse and I use it is as a helper or an
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.760]   assistant in our endeavor to be readers. So one of the hardest parts about being a big reader is
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.040]   selecting which books to read. You select a dud where it's not very good, or it's redundant to
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.920]   things you already know. You've wasted time. You've wasted money. Blinkist can help you triage
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.200]   the books you read. So what we do is when we hear about a book we might be interested in, we first
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.640]   will listen to read the blink. Getting the main ideas really helps you figure out, oh, I definitely
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.760]   want to go deeper into this, or this isn't for me. But even when you say this isn't for me, you've
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.640]   still learned the main ideas. That's something you can file away into that sort of scheme of
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.280]   information in your head, and you still gain something from it. So it's a fantastic way to
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:13.760]   actually triage the world of potential books to read among other uses that people have for Blinkist.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.520]   Now, right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience. Go to Blinkist.com/deep to start

[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   Bladder. The holiday season is a time when you think about the people that you care about. Well,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:04.080]   one of the things you need to offer them is security in the untimely event of something
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.760]   happening to you. This is where life insurance comes in. Everyone I know at my current age,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.560]   as someone who's in sort of young middle age, you know, knows they need life insurance, but I would
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.640]   say many of them don't have enough, and mainly just because they don't know how to do it. Maybe
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.960]   their employer automatically gives them a little bit, but how do you go about getting more life
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   insurance? It's the logistical hurdle that stops people from offering this security to those that
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:35.520]   depend on them more so than anything else. This is where Ladder enters the scene. It is 100%

[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.560]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions. Who do we have first?
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   First question's from Arjan. What do you think of the book and underlying methodology,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.000]   building a second brain? In earlier episodes, you mentioned that systems don't make a huge
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.120]   difference in your productivity. Well, I think it is important that you have a good, stable,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.560]   trusted place to store information that is relevant to your life or your professional
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.400]   endeavors. Your primary brain, your first brain, if we're going to use this terminology,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.720]   is not great at storing large amounts of complicated information, often information
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.400]   that you don't yet have a use for, but you might in the future. It's very difficult for it to keep
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.680]   track of all of that and to remember where it comes from. You know, oh yeah, I read at some
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   point this article about the developers for Mario having a new technique and what was that and where
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.320]   was that. You can remember some of that stuff, but a lot of it you're going to forget. So the idea of
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:24.160]   a second brain in the sense of having some sort of external system to keep track of stuff, ideas
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.280]   and information that might be useful completely makes sense if you work in the knowledge industry,
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.080]   if you work in an industry where the keeping track of an application of ideas and knowledge
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   is important. The thing is, the system doesn't have to be super complicated for you to get most
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:50.800]   of its benefits. I, for example, right now make a lot of use out of my remarkable notebook. It's
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.960]   a digital notebook that inside it, I right now have like 20 or 30 different notebooks all in the
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.880]   same physical package. I have notebooks for all sorts of different things, book ideas, article
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.680]   ideas, things that are happening within my media business. So I always have a place to take notes
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.920]   on something and I know they're all in there. And I have to remember that those digital notebooks
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.000]   exist in there, but I usually do. So it's like, okay, what's going on with the video on our
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.840]   podcast? I know there's a notebook digitally in my remarkable somewhere where I've been keeping
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.560]   thoughts on that. And I can go there and see what's going on. When I'm working on an article
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:28.320]   or a book, I'm typically going to have a Scrivener project for that book or article, and I'll just
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.920]   collect relevant files, papers, articles into the research folders in that Scrivener. So they're
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   just right there. So as I'm just sort of thinking about the background, collecting, collecting,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.640]   collecting the, when it comes time to write that information is right there. There are better ways
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.280]   I could do all of this from a strictly technical standpoint. I could have a system that had all of
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.560]   this, that tagged it and cross-connected it, or I could do searches or explore connections.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.000]   But in my experience, that extra element of complexity in the storage and connection of
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.600]   information doesn't pay off much. And in the end, if you work in the creative production,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.440]   thinking is thinking. The idea that a system is going to do thinking for you or make that
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.760]   thinking more simple, it's not usually how it works. Typically for those of us who think for
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.840]   a living, the ideas that are important emerge in our brain, sort of festered and begin working on
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.720]   it. And then you want to be able to look up, you know, Oh yeah, I've read this article could be
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.600]   useful here, but it's just old fashioned grinding intellectual work of the type we talked about in
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.200]   last week's episode, where I talked about what goes into being a serious thinker.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.640]   It's just your brain doing stuff. Now, does that mean having any more complicated systems,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   something built in notion in which everything is a database entry that could be cross-listed?
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.760]   Is this bad? No. I mean, for a lot of people, it's actually quite enjoyable. I think
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:52.800]   building custom information systems, if you're of a certain type of developer CSE mindset,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.680]   can be an actual really rewarding and fun activity. I like doing that type of stuff.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.120]   I don't have a lot of time to do it right now, but it fits with my personality.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.640]   Ooh, I built this notion system that connects us. I like that stuff.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.480]   Like Jesse and I have, uh, in our connection with our, our advertising agency, right? Jesse,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.840]   it's, um, they built out a whole notion based system where the episodes have their own notion
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.520]   elements and we have different views where you, all the information, it's a really cool system.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   Actually. Yeah. Uh, I like that type of thing, but it's just not necessary. So that's the way
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.120]   I think about second brains is you do need a way to collect stuff. That's not just in your head.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.800]   The complexity of that system is more about what you enjoy
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.360]   than it is about having a big impact on the value you get back from the brain
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   and what you don't want to do. And I, and you know, this happens in online culture
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.840]   and extreme examples of online culture is you don't want to put too much faith into the brain itself.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.960]   You don't want to downplay the importance of just good old fashioned, hard
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   thinking. I'm walking and thinking, what idea do I keep coming back to you? Let me develop,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   let me polish that idea. Uh, just coming back to that. And I got to tell you, as a professional
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.440]   writer, I can't tell you how often I've collected articles forever and books and papers when I'm
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.600]   working on a book chapter or New Yorker piece. And in the end, when you get the writing,
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   you still end up just in the moment using Google and like, I don't have exactly what I,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.280]   now that I'm writing, this is what I really need. And you end up just going and finding it in the
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.920]   moment anyways, right? Like I've never had, I've never been able to collect enough information
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.280]   that it's all just there because you don't know where the idea is going to go. Once you start
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.000]   actually pulling that thread out, you don't know what particular example or where it's going to
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.920]   wander once you actually start recording and structuring it. So even for all that work,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.840]   writing still ends up being a lot of writing, stopping, thinking, looking something up,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.200]   writing some more, it's tedious. It's hard. You're not going to have these associative
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.880]   connections that make a brilliant ideas just fall out. You're not gonna be able to just click
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.240]   buttons. You have all the information you need. I mean, intellectual work is hard and the second
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:56.080]   brain can't make it less hard, but you got to have something beyond that. You know,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:03.520]   it just varies on what you as the user find enjoyable. All right. What do we got next?
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.280]   Next question is from Brandon. I'm supposed to work 40 hours of billable time each week.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:15.040]   I usually do deep work sessions of 90 to 60 to 90 minutes, then take a 20 to 30 minute break.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.000]   I do personal admin tasks in these breaks. So to bill 40 hours, I would have to work
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.200]   over 50 hours each week. Should I take longer to do tasks during my deep work sessions
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.640]   to bill more? I'm afraid if I ask for more work, I'll get overloaded.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.040]   Yeah, I hear this a lot. I'm assuming Brandon's a lawyer. I hear this a lot from lawyers.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.840]   It always seems very reasonable to the outside when the lawyers of the big firm say I have to
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.120]   bill 40 hours a week, but they don't realize this often can take them 60 hours of work to actually
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   get to the 40 billable hours. Brandon, I would say do not ask for more work. I think you will
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:58.880]   get overloaded. I would reduce these non-billable breaks. I mean, it makes sense on paper after 60
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.800]   to 90 minutes of deep work on a client, let me spend 30 minutes doing a personal thing so my
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.640]   mind can recharge and then go back to 60 more minutes working on a client. I would find a way
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.000]   to introduce more billable deep breaks. So deep breaks, this is something we talked about,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.040]   and I got an essay I wrote years ago, but it comes up occasionally on the show.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.960]   And what it says is in deep work, there's ways to throttle back the cognitive intensity of what
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.200]   you're doing without having to stop altogether what you're doing. So you're not changing your
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.320]   context completely to something unrelated, but maybe you're working on a hard piece of a client
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   brief. And then you pull back to just, I'm gathering and organizing notes for the next
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.520]   section I'm going to write. It's less of a lift. Or I'm doing communication now. I've batched
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.080]   together a lot of communication related to this client. Or I'm going to write these more careful,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.440]   process-oriented emails, where I don't just shoot things out, but say, okay,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.560]   here's what we're working on. I'm going to suggest here's what the next three steps are.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.680]   Let me outline, get me those responses, put them in this folder, et cetera, like take time.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.280]   So I have these deep breaks where it's still billable, but it's less cognitively intense,
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.600]   where you're organizing what you're doing. You're carefully, but slowly maybe
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.160]   filing away what you just did and communicating what you're doing.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.040]   Because what I want for you here, Brandon, is to have less total hours of work.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.760]   I would like your total work count to get closer to the 40 hours that you're billing.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.200]   And then when you're done work, be done with work and very efficiently work on personal stuff.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.520]   It's going to be much more relaxing to just be done with work and then tackle the personal stuff.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:42.320]   So I often tell lawyers that you have to be careful about making more things billable,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:49.120]   not in a false way, but just being able to ride the ups and downs of cognitive intensity so you
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.920]   can go longer in billable work. And if you're careful about what you do in the down periods,
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.480]   you can actually make your work higher quality and more useful. It's I'm organizing stuff better,
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.040]   I'm communicating better. And so that's what I would recommend.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   All right, who do we got next? Another B.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.720]   Yep. Next question is from Bob. As part of a big organization,
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.360]   I don't have much control over IT systems, but in my role, I do have a reasonable say in how
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.840]   multiple teams spend their time, short of buying them all deep work and making them watch your
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:24.480]   capture configure control videos. What do you think? That's a good question. That's the wrong
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:31.200]   book. You should have them all by how to be a high school superstar. And don't explain it, Bob.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.360]   It just insists that they all read it. For those who don't know, that was a book I wrote
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.280]   years ago, how to be a high school superstar. Actually, a really cool book. I like that book
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.400]   a lot. All right. I know you were joking some about like, look, I'm not just going to buy them
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:51.120]   all a copy of a book, but maybe you should. The book I would have people read, the people in the
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.640]   team you can control. If you're going to have them read a book of mine, I would have them read
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   A World Without Email. So A World Without Email, what this book does is shifts the way you understand
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.840]   your world when you're in one of these big knowledge work organizations. It comes in and
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.680]   it's the fish that doesn't even know what water is and explains what water is. So you know better
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.440]   how to deal with it. I increasingly think in big organizations, A World Without Email is how you
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:23.120]   change the vocabulary with which people even understand their work. Now, changes to behavior
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.600]   will be possible. So what are they going to learn if they read A World Without Email? Well, first,
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.120]   it's going to come in and say, wait a second. Work is not just work. In knowledge work, you have a
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.480]   bunch of brains that have to collaborate and share information with each other to add value
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   to existing information. How do you do this is specific and has an impact. And how you're doing
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.160]   it right now, you don't realize this, but in your workplace where it's constant emails and Slack and
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.480]   people throwing meeting invites back and forth, is you're using a very specific collaboration
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.280]   strategy that the book names. It calls it the hyperactive hive mind. Everything gets worked out
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.720]   on the fly, unscheduled back and forth messaging. And for a lot of people, that's just synonymous
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   with work. That's what work is. And the reason why they think that's synonymous with work is
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:11.760]   because when they try to imagine life without the hyperactive hive mind, what they imagine is just
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.680]   shutting all those services down with no response in return. If I didn't have email and Slack in
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.320]   these meetings, all this work I'm doing using email, Slack in these meetings just would stop.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:29.600]   So it just seems like a fantastical fairy tale. But when they understand this is one way among
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.200]   others, you could be collaborating. There's other ways to collaborate that don't require
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.600]   unscheduled messages. Yes, you would have to actually define these new ways of collaborating.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.320]   It's not just turning off Slack, it's putting in its place. Here's our process for this type
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:48.160]   of work. Here's our process for that type of work. It's doing proactive work, not just turning things
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.400]   off. But when they understand there's different options, they begin to say, well, should we be
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.080]   using those other options? And when they read the whole first part of the book that lays out
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.160]   with clinical precision, why the hyperactive hive mind just beats us down and exhausts us and burns
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.920]   us all out, they'll become increasingly motivated for if there are other options, well, sure, we
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.560]   should go after them. Then they're going to get principles in that book about how do you design
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.440]   options that are better than the hyperactive hive mind. And you learn about what makes a good
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.920]   process or not, how you create these things in the organization. It's an important book for any
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.080]   organization that feels overloaded. The members feel overloaded and they feel like there's no
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.760]   way to actually change it. Now, if you're in a smaller organization or you're a freelancer,
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.200]   or you're just wondering what you can do as an individual, deep work is an important book.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.520]   It says concentration is important. But at the organizational level, the question is,
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.320]   how do we free up this time for concentration? And that's what it gets into. So I am,
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   and this is self-serving, of course, I can say you read that book, you buy that book for everyone
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.480]   else. So everyone's speaking the same vocabulary and has the same toolkit. Then I think you're
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:57.120]   ready to start talking about making some systemic changes, not just individuals getting better
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.160]   habits, but how as the systems we use as an organization, how do we improve those
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.600]   so that work is not so draining and doesn't generate so much overload.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.760]   It's an important book, Jesse. It's harder to, you know, it doesn't, though it does give a lot
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.840]   of advice to individuals. It's not so just clear cut to individuals. There's more management theory
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.720]   in it. So I have to sell it a little harder, but I really think the ideas in there are important.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.840]   So that's where Bob should start. - I remember when I was reading it
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:30.320]   back in 2020, when did it come out? - 21. - 21. I had the hard copy and at various
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.840]   copy shops, people would ask about it. - Oh, they'd see the cover?
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.840]   - I remember I was in Miami once and had it. - Yeah.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.800]   - That's what we're asking. - Yeah.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   So keep your cover on if you're going to read it.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:49.680]   Ooh, okay. So Jesse, I have labeled our next question here. This is potentially a slow
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.520]   productivity corner question. This is the one quarter question per episode that relates to
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.240]   the philosophy of slow productivity. So in celebration of my book on slow productivity
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.720]   that comes out in March, though it's available for pre-order right now, anywhere books are sold,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.280]   we like to have one question per episode that touches on slow productivity.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   We like to mark this with some theme music. Jesse, let's hear the slow productivity corner
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:21.920]   theme music, if you would. - Here we go. - I'm excited about this.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.200]   All right, what's our slow productivity corner of the day, Jesse?
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   - This question is from Patrick. When I'm collaborating with other researchers,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.360]   projects often grind to a halt due to uncontrollable factors. For this reason,
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.960]   I adapted a barbell strategy after Nassim Taleb. For example, I have a pool of potential projects
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.560]   from which I hope that at least one will be where every collaborator is available.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.280]   I'm a bit annoyed about the overhead it requires to rekindle the fire for each halted project,
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.200]   not to mention that since I am working in machine learning, time is often a critical factor.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.440]   What should I do? - Well, I'm calling this a slow productivity
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:05.040]   quarter question because there is a principle of slow productivity that I think could be relevant
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:13.280]   here. That is principle number two, work at a natural pace. So some of what might be happening
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:19.360]   here is that there is an impatience with not being able to just get after it with one of these
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:25.440]   projects. Let's just all work on this 10 hours a day, let's give it a week and have this cool
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:33.120]   thing to show. Often things that are a very high quality and very intellectually demanding
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:39.040]   are complicated fields. So in this case, research on machine learning takes time to get right.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.400]   And that pacing then as you work on it goes up and down. There's periods where you're working
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.920]   on it pretty intensely and periods where it's fallow and then you're back to it again.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   Things take time. Now, in my book on slow productivity, I have a real example of this
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.800]   principle where I follow the playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda through the seven-year odyssey.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:06.400]   It took him from his initial performance of In The Heights, a college performance of In The Heights,
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.320]   to that show debuting on Broadway seven years later. And I go through like,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.120]   look during this period, I reconstructed a TikTok of how that play came together.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.400]   There was periods where they were working intensely on it, periods where he wasn't,
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.200]   it just took a long time. So some things that are good just take a lot of time.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.280]   So this is a slow productivity principle, increase the scale at which you're measuring
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.800]   your productivity. So don't be frustrated you didn't work on this project this month.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.040]   What you want to be happy about is over the last two years, I had three really
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.800]   impressive projects come through. So we just get better with not just slowing down,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.880]   but varying our pace. There's also a pragmatic answer here. This is just one academic to another.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.400]   You might just need better collaborators or a better style of collaborating.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.240]   This happens as well. Sometimes you have a group of collaborators you're used to working with
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   because maybe you went to grad school with them or you met them at a conference and they're
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.240]   overloaded and they're busy and they just stall on things and it's very frustrating
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.200]   for you in the project. This could just mean they're disorganized or it could mean
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.520]   they are prioritizing your work with them lower than other things they're working on.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:15.360]   Find better collaborators. So that means in particular, maybe collaborators who you can
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:20.880]   work with more regularly, they're at your university. So you could just work regularly
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.640]   without having to wait to try to organize meetings that are going to happen.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.840]   This was one of the great advantages of MIT. I noticed when I was there is there were so many
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.480]   great people there that you could just be working with people. They were all there in person.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.680]   Two, find collaborators for whom the work you're doing with them is their tier one project.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:45.200]   Once you're working with someone and they see this as their second or third tier project,
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.320]   they're going to ignore it more. So you want to work with people who see at the same level of
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.240]   you in terms of how they're seeing that work. That could help as well. And maybe do more work
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:58.640]   that's solo or at least have something going on where it's just you and your insight and you can
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.800]   control your own time. So we have the slow productivity answer, which is slow down.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.960]   You have ups and downs. That's fine. That's actually how really good creative stuff typically
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:14.160]   is produced, not in a big frenzied push. And we have the pragmatic academic answer,
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:19.280]   which is find better collaborators, find a better collaboration style.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.120]   And that is our slow productivity corner. Should we do the music again, Jesse?
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:26.320]   Yes.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:39.120]   Do you have any slow productivity projects that you work on, say, two hours a week?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.920]   Or is that too little?
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.640]   That's possible. It's possible, right? I think it's possible to have something that you're really
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.320]   back-burnering that you just kind of return to. I mean, I've had this before where it's a big
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.360]   thought about a major change or a major new idea. Or I might just for a long period just come back
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.640]   to it maybe one walk per week and just think about it. Like, I'm OK if this whole year I'm just sort
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.320]   of mulling this with no pressure. When I feel inspired, I'd say first cup of coffee, have a
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   clear morning. That could actually aggregate sometimes into really good insight because
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.680]   you're exploring the space. And over time, things stick. And especially for really big ideas or
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.400]   projects or changes to your life, you can't force it. You can't sit down like, I'm going to figure
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:28.240]   out how to overhaul my life this weekend. So I think even one session a week over a year,
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.880]   that's not an unreasonable pace for certain types of slow projects.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.760]   I should also say, relating to the book Slow Productivity, someone emailed and said,
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.120]   hey, is there going to be incentives for pre-ordering? Like, hey, do we get something?
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.320]   And I'll say, yes, we have really cool stuff we're developing. We're going to announce it
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.560]   all in January, in the new year. But if you ended up, if you've already pre-ordered the book or
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.960]   pre-order it now, it's fine. Just you'll have your Amazon receipt or whatever digital receipt you have
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.520]   from wherever you bought it. You will be able to submit that when we announce the pre-order
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.640]   incentives in January. But we've got some really cool stuff that is bubbling. So buy the book
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.120]   whenever cool stuff is coming. All right, let's do another question. What do we have?
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:14.720]   Next question is from Matt, but it's actually for his wife. My wife was promoted last year,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.120]   is now an HR executive at a large company. Her new position is all the trappings of the
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.880]   hyperactive hive mind. She's got email overload, frequent Teams messages, never-ending business
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.200]   hours, context switching, asynchronous communication, the whole nine yards,
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.920]   not to mention an insane number of meetings. I think she's making herself sick from overworking
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.240]   stress and I'm worried. I've suggested office hours and time blocking, but she says it's not
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:44.480]   feasible or else she'll just fall behind. She's a rising executive, but not quite senior enough to
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.000]   set the tone and the culture of her company. Any recommendations? Well, first of all, I'm shocked
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.440]   to hear that you go into your wife and saying, let me give you advice for how to do this based on
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:02.000]   what this guy, Cal Newport, told me. I'm shocked that didn't work. There are so many partners out
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   there who have had their husbands tell them at some point, let me tell you what Cal Newport says
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.960]   you should be doing. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It can't come from you. So what can we do
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:20.000]   here? So in these situations, here's the problem. There is stuff you can do to make your life
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.720]   somewhat better. This is where deep work and in particular a world without email, those books
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.920]   would be relevant at a high-level HR position like this, a high-level executive position,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.160]   probably a world without email would be the better book for someone like your wife to read because
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.880]   you need a very complicated, precise understanding of exactly what these workflows are, how they came
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.000]   from, how to sidestep or replace them in a way that's going to be even more productive. You can't
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.320]   handle this ad hoc. You can't just throw random heuristics and tactics at it. So your wife could
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:55.440]   improve her situation somewhat and maybe get near a copy of a world without email or something and
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.680]   somehow be like, look, I don't know, just maybe you'll find something useful in here. Maybe like
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.640]   say, I'm too dumb to understand this, but I think you're smart enough to understand it. Just don't
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.080]   make it seem like it's you giving advice. She might find some useful things there.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:12.160]   The other problem here is that this life of extreme hyperactive hive mind is fundamental
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:18.000]   to a lot of executive positions. It's just the way these organizations run. If you're a new
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.360]   executive, it's very difficult to massively change this. I don't have any good examples of a very
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:29.440]   large company yet moving away from the hyperactive hive mind. I've seen this successful at smaller
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.240]   sized companies where there's still some agility. There could still be a leader effect where a
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.120]   leader can say we're changing things, but at a really huge company, it's really hard to change
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:45.760]   this. There's an interesting source for why this is. There's a book I was reading recently. It's
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:52.080]   by Alfred Chandler. It's from the seventies. It's called The Visible Hand. I think it won
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.360]   the National Book Award. It might've even won the Pulitzer Prize. It's an economic history book,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:03.280]   and he looks at the rise of large organizations in the wake in particular of the railroad boom,
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.920]   late 19th, early 20th century America, where we get really big office buildings full of people.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:13.520]   One of the things he argues in this book that was very influential is that we shifted into the rise
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:19.120]   of the large organizational era. We shifted into a new type of capitalism that he calls managerial
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.560]   capitalism. No longer like it would have been in the time of Dickens, where you have small firms
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.960]   run by a person, and it's their company, and they're in charge of the company. You had these
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.320]   massive organizations where no one person can run it. So you had to bring in a class of managers
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.400]   because there's just too many people and too much going on. The railroads created this because to
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.880]   run a railroad profitably, you had to consolidate and it's very complicated. And you can't just have
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.800]   a guy like with the monopoly hat on. This is, I know everything that's happening on my railroad.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:55.600]   So you had to have classes of managers. And Chandler argues the way that managers operate
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:03.200]   internally is free from direct market pressures. In other words, it's not, we have a direct
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.920]   pressure on, is the way we're running this internally the best way to run it? And if it's
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:13.200]   not, another company is going to take over and we're going to go out of business. In really
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.960]   large organizations, you're buffered from those type of market forces. This allows managers in
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:25.760]   a managerial capitalist economy to actually prioritize other factors than just what's
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:31.440]   most productive or what's most efficient in producing value. They can prioritize instead
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:37.200]   things like stability. What's going to keep this me in my position and the organizations functioning
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.800]   like most stable? What's going to keep me most secure in my position? What's going to require
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:49.200]   substantial increases of energy? What's going to reduce risk? Risk is very dangerous.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:54.560]   So you can actually have these forces on how organizations run that are disconnected from
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:00.160]   the market pressure to just run better. This is why I'm more and more convinced that large
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.400]   organizations, the hyperactive hive mind gets entrenched because in managerial capitalism,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:09.440]   to move away from the flexible accessibility and easiness of just everyone can talk to everyone,
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   my worth is indicated as much as anything else by me just replying to things really quickly.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.760]   It is risky to move away from that. It is complicated to move away from that.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.680]   It's the opposite of stability to try to build new systems from scratch. These type of things
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:30.880]   cannot come from the managerial class. Just like no number of floor managers in Henry Ford's
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:37.120]   Red River automobile manufacturing plant in the early 1900s, no number of those managers,
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.920]   no matter how smart they are, were ever going to spontaneously change that factory over to an
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.040]   assembly line. That required Ford saying, "I don't care that this is a pain. Trust me. This is going
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:53.280]   to be better." That's where we are right now. So these executives, it's sort of like the managerial
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:59.360]   class. There is no internal pressure to change. Actually, a system in which grinding out bigger
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:06.560]   hours is rewarded is good. I know this. It's also stable. It's easy. There's less risk if
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.720]   everyone just has to respond to me all the time. So it's somewhat fundamental to these
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.400]   organizations. Now, ultimately, the solution has to be the leaders of the organizations,
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.560]   the business owners themselves have to come in and say, "We're building our equivalent of the
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:22.320]   assembly line. We're changing things. I don't care if it's risky and I don't care if it's unstable."
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.960]   That's what ultimately has to happen. But until that happens, Matt, your wife's position is going
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.160]   to have this element to it that is not pleasant. And I think people need to properly assess the
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.480]   negative cost of a extreme hyperactive hive mind association. It is the psychological equivalent
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:44.080]   of working in a coal mine with bad ventilation. It's bad for you, bad for your health. It's not
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:50.480]   pleasant. And so you have to keep that in mind. So what can you do about that? Well, you have to
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.360]   be willing to say, "Is this trade-off worth whatever benefits I'm getting?" And you better
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:00.240]   be pretty clear about that trade-off. Sometimes what happens is people say, "I don't know what
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.040]   else to do, but moving up the ladder seems prestigious. And I like the momentary feeling
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.920]   of prestige. So I'm going to move up into this position and now my life is terrible."
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.680]   That happens a lot. So it's important that you and your wife have clarity, a lifestyle-centric,
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.120]   career-planning-style clarity of what you want your life to be like in all aspects.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.040]   Does this job support that? Is there something you could do with this job to better support that?
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.080]   Maybe it's giving you much more money and it allows you to move to the place you want to move
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.840]   and you have some vision for it. Great. But I would have some clarity here and make sure that
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.240]   she hasn't just stumbled into this because it's the next thing to do, because it's not going to be
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:43.680]   changeable by her to a massive degree. And it can be really negative. The life of an extreme
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.440]   hyperactive hive mind organization can be really negative, have a heavy toll. So we just got to
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.720]   face those tolls as a family and figure out what actually is our goals here. And it might be,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.800]   "This is fine. It's a fair trade. We're getting this money for this. Maybe it fits her personality."
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:06.080]   Some people like that, the strom and drong of all of the activity. Or maybe it's, "You're right.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.960]   I'm thinking about this. Why are we doing this? This makes me miserable. And to what end? Other
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.920]   than I'm impressing the three people who promoted me and they forgot about it already." So there's
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.600]   a lot going on here, Matt. I don't mean to throw too much at you. It's an excuse for me to preach
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   about managerial capitalism. But your wife could read a role without email. There's changes she can
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.840]   make that'll help some. But you have to confront that this may be, in a lot of ways, a really tough
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:41.040]   job. All right. Do we have a phone call? Yeah, we do. Let's do a phone call. Then I have a case
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:49.280]   study loaded for after that phone call is over. Hey, Cal. Hey, Jessie. Now it's the holiday season.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:56.320]   I wonder what you're gifting. What do you want to get? And do you have any holiday traditions
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.280]   or rituals that you'd like to share?
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:07.520]   Well, it's a good question. I'll say what. I don't think he listens to this podcast. I think
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:14.080]   it's okay. I can share what I did for my brother from a gift perspective. He doesn't listen?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.800]   I don't know. He hasn't mentioned it. If he's listening, I'm about to spoil his present.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:26.320]   Because what we do in our family is we draw names in my extended family so that you have one person
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.440]   you're buying a gift for. So you can buy a nicer gift as opposed to, because I have a bunch of
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:37.360]   siblings and they're all married. So it's a lot of people. So we draw names. So I drew my
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.680]   brother's name. So I won't give the details of exactly what title this is, but it's something
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.320]   I've gotten into more recently. There's a book he really likes, an author he likes, and books he
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:54.240]   likes. He talks about them a lot. So I tracked down at a rare book dealer, first edition. The
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.440]   first English language edition is a Russian writer. They claim it's also a first printing
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.760]   of the first edition, but it's a stated first edition, which means it says in the book first
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.400]   edition. Printing is more complicated. So they claim it's a first printing as well.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:16.400]   So from the sixties, this was the very first copies of this book available in the English
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:22.640]   language. I think first edition stuff is cool because books are so influential. When you have
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:30.560]   a first edition of an influential book, it's like a historical artifact. In 1968, this was one of a
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.200]   certain number of copies that people were reading and it was changing the new sphere. It was changing
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.920]   our collective understanding of this part of the world. So I think it mixes ideas and respect for
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   ideas with historical artifacts, and you can display them, or it's just cool to have for your
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.400]   collection. I don't know if he's going to like it or not, but I thought it was a cool idea. I'm
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   increasingly interested in doing this myself. So that was my new gift strategy. It's something I
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.720]   was trying to do this year. That's cool. In terms of rituals, I like lighting and decorations or
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:07.360]   whatever. So we switched up. We have a winter wonderland theme this year. In your home office?
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:15.760]   Outside my house. Oh, nice. Yeah. So not Christmas because I want it to be relevant in the January
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:22.160]   winter wonderland. So it's icicles. I'm using spots. I've been using more spotlights in my
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.560]   lighting display. I think you can paint with color with spotlights and change the objects
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.440]   already in your yard. Do you guys code them like you talked about? I coded my Halloween lights. I
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:39.040]   didn't code my holiday lights because I'm going for more of a tasteful aesthetic. The coded stuff
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:46.160]   is usually like crazy, more crazy stuff. So no animatronics, no program lights. Though I did buy
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.880]   a chip-controlled lighting, like a lighting controller. I had been using a relatively
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.560]   somewhat complicated system. I had two circuits that both ran through light sensors,
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.800]   where you then had a timer. When it gets dark, turn on for this much time and then turn off.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.560]   And I've now moved that past. I have a single circuit where everything is controlled off a
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.120]   programmable chip. So I can say exactly on each day, exactly when to turn on the lights, exactly
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.560]   when to turn them off. That I've really appreciated. I really like to be able to fine tune
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.720]   that and not just depend on these light sensors coming and going.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.520]   That's so good.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:29.840]   Yeah. So there we go. Good question. All right. Let me do a case study. Then we'll get to our
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.400]   third segment here. A case study is where I just read a story that one of you, my listeners have
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.040]   sent in about applying the type of things we talk about to the specific circumstances in your life.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.760]   I thought this one was interesting. It's from Austin. So here's what he said.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   I'm a long time listener of your podcast and reader of your work. And I have finally quit
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.240]   the Twitter habit so I can build a better life. The straw that finally broke the camel's back
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.800]   after seven years of heavy Twitter use was a disturbing experience here in my city of Houston.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.360]   My partner and I went to a restaurant a few weeks ago, a nice place in a nice neighborhood near a
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.640]   top tier university. At the table next to ours, an older, well-dressed, well-groomed gentleman
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.280]   was dining with a friend of his. I could not help but overhear their conversation. The older man
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:19.520]   spent almost the entire time loudly regurgitating conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory,
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.120]   from the 2020 presidential vote tabulation to the efficacy of COVID vaccines, while his friend tried
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.920]   to gently steer him back to the present. The older man was so anxious and agitated that it was
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.320]   uncomfortable to sit near him. The experience seemed a little less surreal, though, when the
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.880]   older man asked his friend for some technical support for an app on his smartphone. He wanted
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.240]   help with Twitter. I felt like a young smoker watching an old smoker who was pulling on a lit
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.880]   cigarette in his stoma while dying of lung cancer. That older man was probably well-educated,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.160]   well-respected, and financially well-off, but with the help of Twitter, he had turned his
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.520]   mind into mashed potatoes. When I left that restaurant, I knew I'd thrown away my digital
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.000]   Marlboros. While I still jones for a smoke every day, I remind myself every time of that older man
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   at the restaurant and refuse to light up. Of course, not smoking by itself is not enough,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.880]   and now I have to build a digital life that doesn't need that drug. I think your recent podcast
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:18.720]   episode about becoming a serious thinker will help with that. Well, Austin, I appreciate that.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:24.240]   I appreciate that story. I mean, I think we're at a time now in our culture where we've moved past
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:32.080]   where I was, let's say, when I recorded my 2017 quit social media talk, where I said at that point,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.120]   "Hey, this should be an acceptable option." That's where we were in 2017. I gave a talk where I said,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.360]   "More people should feel comfortable doing this. Not using social media should not be weird.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.320]   It should be like a standard thing that some people do." That's where we were in 2017.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:54.000]   In 2023, I think for tools in particular, Twitter and TikTok, it should be just no one should use
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.760]   these. They've proven themselves to be a digital fentanyl, as some people are calling TikTok.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.640]   The highs are absolutely not worth it. The lows are worse than we thought.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.800]   The negative impact on individual people's lives, like that older person you saw in the restaurant,
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.920]   or the way our entire civic cultures execute, it's so negative and so terrible, and the crisis is so
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:25.840]   big, find another high. I think we've shifted from 2017 to 2023, where beyond just normalizing not
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:32.400]   using social media, say some of these tools, just say no. We need McGruff the crime dog.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:39.360]   Just say no. More people need to just say, "I am done. I think they've proven themselves bankrupt.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:46.480]   I think these tools are just not worth use." Find another way to connect to interesting people,
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:55.120]   or hear about the news, hear even baseball rumors. MLBTradeRumors.com, that's fine.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.960]   Actually, reading the articles posted by Nats bloggers and beat writers, that's fine. Even me,
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.000]   I'm not using Twitter for baseball news. I think it's time to move on. It's just like smoking in
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.360]   the '80s. At some point, we're like, "All right, it's not just kids and pregnant women shouldn't
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.200]   do this. Maybe really we just shouldn't smoke." I think that's where we're getting with some of
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.280]   these tools. All right. Well, we've got a third segment coming up where I react to the news,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.640]   but first I want to take a brief moment to talk about another set of sponsors.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:32.320]   Particular this show today, our show is sponsored by BetterHelp. The holidays is one of these times
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.120]   where a lot of people really enjoy it, but for a lot of people, it can be from a mental perspective,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.720]   very difficult. It help brings out or emphasize things that aren't going well in your life.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.080]   It can supercharge the negative ruminations or self-incriminations that really can help you
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:54.160]   live the life you want to live. This is where therapy enters the scene. Of course, the issue
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.440]   with therapy, even if you recognize, yes, my brain is the most important organ on my body. If it's
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.280]   not working right, I want to get fixed. What's difficult is figuring out how do I get started?
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.320]   Where do I find a therapist? What if the therapist nearby is not good? What if they're good,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:15.120]   but they're full and I'm never going to get in? This is where BetterHelp enters the scene.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.920]   It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule. You just
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.600]   fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist. You can switch therapists
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.280]   at any time for no additional charge. Do it right now. If you're thinking about or worried
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.680]   about your mental state, do it right now as the holidays are ramping up. You can start down the
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:42.160]   road to a better relationship with your brain right away. Hit the new year already en route to
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.080]   fixing what could be the most important relationship in your life, which is the relationship with your
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:56.000]   mind. So in the season of giving, give yourself what you need with BetterHelp. Visit betterhelp.com/deepquestions
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:06.960]   today to get 10% off your first month. That's betterhelp.com/deepquestions. You also do not
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:14.000]   want to go into your holiday season with a bad looking shave. This is where Hinson Shaving
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:22.080]   enters the scene. This is the razor that I use. So what I like about the Hinson razor is that it's
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.840]   this beautifully manufactured aluminum artifact. Precision milled so that you can take a 10 cent
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.320]   safety razor blade, put it into this beautiful razor, screw it in, and because it's so precisely
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.960]   milled, you get this .0013 inches of the blade extends beyond the body, allowing you to get a
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:48.160]   clean shave without the up and down diving board effect. So no nicks, no clogs. This beautiful
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.960]   razor takes standard blades and makes them into something capable of giving you a really great
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:01.840]   shave. It is what I use. It is also a great gift idea. It's a great gift idea. You give someone
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.480]   a Hinson razor, what you're giving them is not only a better shave, but you're freeing them from
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.120]   the expense of having to go to the drugstore every month and buy those super expensive disposable
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.440]   blades. You're freeing them from the expense of having to have a subscription service that every
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.560]   month is charging them again and again to send them these plastic coated blades that are milled
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.760]   wherever. You're giving them a beautiful artifact that's actually over time going to save them money
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.960]   as well. So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:37.600]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll get two years
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.400]   worth of blades for free with your razor. Just make sure you add the blades to your cart and
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.360]   then later when you enter the code, the price will go to zero. That's 100 free blades when you head to
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:13:00.640]   h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal and use that code CAL. All right, Josie, time for the third segment.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:06.720]   All right, the third segment is where I like to bring up something that's happening
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.160]   in the world around us and react to it. The thing I want to react to today, it's a chart
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:19.920]   that was tweeted by Derek Thompson. I actually did his show not too long ago. I think over the summer,
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.800]   maybe it was. I think it was over the summer. It was a good episode. He has a really good podcast
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.920]   on the Ringer Network. And so you can check that out. So I did Derek Thompson's show in the summer.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.640]   Anyways, writer for the Atlantic, covers technology workplace trends. He tweeted,
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.080]   and I have the tweet up here on the screen for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:48.320]   He tweeted recently a chart that is showing standardized scores in mathematics, reading,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.800]   and science. This is not just for the US. These are trends across the entire developed world.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:01.040]   What do we see? They're going down in each of these areas. So you see some stability or growth
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:07.200]   and then a quick fall in a lot of these areas. Now, let's look at the timing here. These charts
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:14.720]   start 2003, and we begin to see these drops depending on where you're looking. In all these
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:23.680]   cases, like right around 2012. So predating COVID related learning losses, we begin to see these
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:32.240]   sharp drops. Here's what Derek says. Between 2012 and 2023, it appears that average OECD reading,
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.120]   math, and science scores have declined consistently. This is not just about pandemic
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.400]   learning loss. It's not just about one US city. It's not even just about the US.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:50.080]   This is the entire developed world. So what is going on here? Well, a couple people had some
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:58.960]   answers. In particular, both Matt Iglesias and John Haidt chimed in in response to Derek's post
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:07.040]   and said, well, hmm, what happened around 2012? Smartphones. That is the big transition that
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.720]   happened around 2012. It was the point where we had more than 50% of the US population owning
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.120]   a smartphone. Those who work with students and children's will say that's roughly right around
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:24.160]   the point where it became much more common to see adolescents starting at 12, 13 years old,
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.080]   having their own smartphones. It was a tipping point. There's all sorts of trends that got worse
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.720]   around 2012 that could be conceivably linked to smartphones, especially trends around
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:43.840]   mental health. We see those trends start to go down. We see trends around loneliness that starts
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.200]   to explode right around the time the smartphones come out. There's a lot of different things that
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:57.040]   happen right around 2012. So here's the thing about these 2012 trends. Yes, it's complicated.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.400]   Yes, there's other factors, but sometimes the obvious thing is just the obvious thing.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.200]   There's a lot of this going around more elite intellectual circles right now. There's a
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.800]   knee-jerk skepticism surrounding this idea that smartphones are causing issues. In this case,
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.240]   the hypothesis would be they distract the hell out of kids. It's harder for them to concentrate,
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.520]   so they do worse on hard academic subjects that require them to concentrate.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.920]   We like to have, if you're an elite intellectual type, you like to have more complicated answers
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.160]   that show that you understand more than other people. If you're an elite academic, maybe you
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.040]   like to have some contrarianism. This seems too common. This seems like something that just like
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.880]   an average parent who's not a writer for a fancy publication or not a professor just noticed,
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.160]   like my kids are using phones, they're getting dumber. You want to signal that you're smarter
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.040]   and more sophisticated than that. There's this knee-jerk skepticism. Well, you know,
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.720]   there's other factors going on, but that's just about signaling to other people that you're smart.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:17:00.640]   Maybe it's time that people doing that signaling can just wear a Harvard shirt and not have to
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.360]   screw around with what's happening with smartphones because I think sometimes the
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:07.120]   obvious trends are actually just right. There's a reason why they're obvious.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.080]   I think this is one on a mountain of other trends that show similar inflection points.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.800]   It has been a big deal to give a generation of kids at a very young age, unrestricted access
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.200]   to the internet through a device they have with them at all times. We could even use the term,
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.400]   it has been a disaster. And so I think we're ready to maybe move past the knee-jerk skepticism
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.680]   while acknowledging complexity surrounds the issue and get more serious as I'm getting more
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.000]   and more reports, by the way, in my inbox, readers are sending it to me of more and more countries
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.720]   and school systems and states. They're starting to take much bigger stances.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.560]   You can't have these in the school. We don't want you to use these phones.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:51.120]   By getting away from this, it's complicated. And here's an example of someone who by using
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.600]   their phone is like help to overcome some sort of circumstance and we don't want them to feel bad.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:02.080]   It's cigarettes. The 14-year-old shouldn't smoke. And I think we're increasingly seeing this about
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:07.360]   smartphones. So this is just the latest impact. We don't have to look too hard to come up with
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.600]   a hypothesis here because of course something that makes you terrible at concentrating is going to
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.440]   immediately hurt your performance on things that require concentration. And that's exactly what
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.320]   we're seeing in those numbers. So this evidence continues to come in, Jesse. I think, again,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:28.240]   I was quoted in GQ back in 2019, maybe. This is where they took the Marlboro box, then changed
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:35.760]   into an iPhone. And the headline was, Calum report says, "One day we will look back on teenage phone
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.240]   use or social media use like we look back now on teenage smoking." I think that's bearing out.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.720]   Give us another 5, 10 years and we're going to say, "Why in the world were we letting 13-year-olds
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.120]   just be on these phones all day and just shrugging our shoulders saying, 'Kids these days are more
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:58.080]   tech savvy. What can we do?'" So more evidence piles up. I also saw there's a chart in response
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:05.040]   to this about average GPA. I think it was at Harvard. Average GPA at Harvard. Wow. These
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.120]   things have really... It's an interesting chart. >>The average GPA went up.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:16.400]   >>Oh, yeah. Yeah. So it's like perhaps a grade inflation in part in response to people getting
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.920]   worse. As people get worse at the primary intellectual skills, you kind of get away
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.960]   from being able to do competitive grading. And so you just maybe grade inflate. So of course,
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.320]   I immediately looked up where was the average GPA. I didn't go to Harvard, but I was like,
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.920]   "Where was the average GPA when I graduated?" Because I had a very high GPA and I want to
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.720]   take credit for that. So I looked it up. I was like, "Okay, back in 2004, the average Harvard
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:47.840]   GPA was like 3.2. So my 3.95 feels better. Now it's like 3.8." It was hard to get a 3.8 back in
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.240]   the day. So I don't know. I think it's impossible that we're not inflating grades because we don't
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:59.040]   see GPAs going down. But certainly, deep six in your ability to concentrate has to have a huge
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.440]   impact on academic work. >>Are you going to have any
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.840]   social media questions on your exam today? >>No, but now I'm in a mean mood. So now I'm
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.320]   just gonna make the questions even harder. This is your own fault for using too many smartphones.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.680]   Be really mean about it. Speaking about that exam, I have to upload it in four minutes.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:24.880]   So we should probably wrap up this episode. Thank you everyone who sent in your questions or calls.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.840]   If you're listening and you want to see everything you just heard,
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.760]   go to thedeeplife.com/listen. This is episode 279. There'll be links to the videos at the bottom of
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.400]   that page. There's also links there for submitting stuff. We'll be back next week with another
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.160]   episode. Really going to be a holiday-themed episode. We are getting close to the holidays.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.840]   And until then, as always, stay deep. >>Hey, so if you enjoyed today's discussion
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:57.040]   about reacting properly to overload, I think you will also like episode 254, The Laws of Less,
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:03.120]   where I go much deeper on building a life in which overload is much less common. Check it out.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.640]   >>So let's make that today's deep question. Why should I do less?
