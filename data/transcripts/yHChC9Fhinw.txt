[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Good people pleasing versus bad people pleasing.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   There's a difference between the two, so how do we know the difference?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   We need to figure it out, and we will today thanks to yet another excellent email question from a listener.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   This time a listener named Nathaniel.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "Pastor John, hello. I need your help on something.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   How do I quit seeking to please every person in my life and focus on pleasing God?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I want to apply Galatians 1 10 to my life. Can you walk me through what this means?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I'm unable to discover God's plan for me because I'm constantly making decisions
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   based on how it pleases or displeases everyone around me. Thank you."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   People pleasing is a great problem for many people.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I would say probably for most people because nobody likes to be criticized.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Nobody likes to be rejected.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We want to be affirmed and admired and accepted,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and therefore everybody is vulnerable to this temptation.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And when we don't get victory over this temptation of people pleasing,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   it can become a very unhealthy, controlling neediness that keeps us in bondage
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   rather than liberating us to do God's will with joy.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   The first thing I think we need to do is to clarify what aspects of pleasing others are good
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and what aspects of pleasing others are harmful.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Nathaniel, who asked this question, has his eye on Galatians 1 10, where Paul says,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "Am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Or am I trying to please man?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Paul says the same thing, the same kind of thing elsewhere.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   For example, 2 Thessalonians 2 4, he says,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   "As we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And he tells slaves in Ephesians 6 5, "Obey your earthly masters,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   not by way of eye service as people pleasers,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And people said of Jesus in Mark 12 14,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   for you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So clearly, Paul and Jesus put a high premium
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   on not being controlled by what other people think.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Both of them say or imply that if you live to please other people,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   you will not live for the sake of the truth,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   which clearly means you won't live for the sake of the will of God.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The opinion of others will become your God
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and will lead you around as if you had a hook in your nose
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and you will not be authentic and you will not be obedient
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and you will not be able to fulfill God's purpose for you on the earth,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   which is to glorify him rather than to esteem the opinion of others so highly.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   However, having said all that against people pleasing,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   that's not the whole story, is it, when it comes to pleasing others?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Because Paul said in Romans 15, 2,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   "Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And in 1 Corinthians 10, 32, he says,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   just as I try to please everyone in everything I do,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   not seeking my own advantage,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   but that of many that they may be saved."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Now, here's the reason those two sets of teachings
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   about people pleasing are not contradictory.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   The efforts to please people in both Romans 15 and 1 Corinthians 10
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   are not to curry the favor of others nor to avoid criticism.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   This effort to please in those two texts is not self-exalting
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and it's not self-protecting.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It is entirely in the service of doing good to others,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   not enhancing one's own position or protecting oneself.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   In the one text, Paul says he pleases others to build them up,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and in the other he says he pleases people in order that they may be saved.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   This is not evidence of an insecure, unhealthy person
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   who needs the approval of others.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   This is evidence of a very healthy, strong, loving person
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   who lives for the good of others.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Sometimes he's able to commend the gospel by pleasing people.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Other times he must defend the gospel by displeasing people.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And in both cases, his own identity remains constant.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   He's not a chameleon changing colors in order to fit in
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   for the sake of his own enhancement or protection.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   He's living for others, whether that calls for displeasing them or pleasing them.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So what needs to happen if we find ourselves in bondage to the opinion of others?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The first thing that needs to happen is that our God needs to become bigger.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   In our lives and in our minds and in our hearts,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   God must increase and people must decrease.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Ed Welch wrote a whole book called "When People Are Big and God Is Small."
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's a great title.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   That's the basic problem.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   People and their opinion loom large in our minds and hearts,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   while God is a distant, scarcely discernible influence on what we feel and do.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   That has to change.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So by prayer and study of God's Word,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   we should focus on the majesty and glory of God in all his attributes and all his ways.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   We need to preach to ourselves that there really is no comparison
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   between knowing God and knowing people,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   between pleasing God and pleasing people,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   between treasuring God and treasuring people.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   God is infinitely greater, more glorious, more satisfying,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   more rewarding than all the people in the world put together.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So that's our first task.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Pray and study the greatness of God into our hearts and minds.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   The second thing that needs to happen, and it happens by means of the first,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   is that when God becomes big, our identity in relation to God becomes secure, firm, glorious.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   If the creator of the universe is your father,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and you are an heir of everything he owns,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   how could the opinion of, say, oh, a million people, a million mere humans,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   control your sense of destiny, your sense of who you are?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Listen to Paul's logic in 1 Corinthians 3.21, following.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   "Let no one boast in men."
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Now remember, what was happening was some were saying, "I'm of Christ.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I'm of Apollos. I'm of Peter. I'm of Paul,"
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   meaning I'm getting my strokes and my identity from lining up with the really famous guy,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   the really good guy.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   These are needy people.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Okay, so, "Let no one boast in men," he says.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Here's the argument.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   "For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   or the present or the future, all are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   What an argument.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The fact that Christians own everything, all are yours.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   The fact that Christians own everything as the children of God
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   and that it's only a matter of time until we come into our inheritance
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   shows how utterly foolish it is to boast about famous people that we know
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   or whose favor we have obtained.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   It's ridiculous.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's a sign that we don't really believe who we are as the children of God.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And thirdly, which is simply an implication of the first two,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   we need to be deeply persuaded that our reward is great in heaven, very great,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   precisely because we incur the displeasure of other people in our faithfulness to Jesus.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Listen to Jesus in Matthew 5.11.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Rejoice."
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You can't do that if you're a people pleaser.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   "Rejoice and be glad."
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Why?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "For great is your reward in heaven."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So instead of being depressed or controlled by the rejection
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and the disapproval of others, Jesus says,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   "If you're walking in obedience to me, that very rejection will result in a great reward."
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   We need to believe that.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   We need to believe that our reward in heaven is great.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I get so sick of people talking about pie in the sky,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   bye-bye, having no relevance for this life.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Good grief!
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   What could be more relevant in Jesus' argument here?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   If you have the resources to rejoice in the face of being scorned, persecuted, reviled, rejected,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   you've got resources to love your enemy like crazy.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   We need to believe that our reward is great in heaven.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's a lot better than pie.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So those are my three steps toward being set free from the bondage of people pleasing.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   May God make your identity as his child, who will inherit everything, firm.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Make your identity as his child stable, firm, deep, unshakable.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And realize how great your reward is while walking in obedience to Jesus
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   precisely because you incur the displeasure of others, not because you avoid it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Yeah, very helpful trio of steps.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
