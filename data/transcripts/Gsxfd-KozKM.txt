[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   There's this one very specific graphic that's called the Dunning-Kruger curve.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.580]   Where this comes from is that they wanted to see was how do people experience kind of themselves
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.300]   based on how much knowledge or skill they have in a specific area.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.700]   So they ran these participants through, you know, the study, all of these tests to assess
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.140]   competency in certain areas.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.180]   And then they also surveyed the participants and actually asked them, okay, how well do
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.280]   you think you did?
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   And a lot of us, when we know nothing about something, we're like, yeah, I don't feel
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.220]   very good about that.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.280]   And once we know a lot about it, we feel very confident.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.100]   But what was really interesting that Dunning and Kruger found is that this very kind of
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.360]   first stage of learning their first stage of competence in something where you're actually
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.140]   very bad at something or your level of knowledge in it is very, very small.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.640]   A lot of us tend to have a lot of confidence at this time.
