[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   How many times do parents try to get their kids to just tell them about their day,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.440]   talk about a problem, and then they pelt them with questions that are really
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.280]   challenging for kids to answer.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.960]   Frankly, sometimes even just saying what'd you do today is challenging.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.800]   But if they say, I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.120]   And you say, because that one word will often get them to open up.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's like these magical phrases that will work in any part of life.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   And if you see my interviews, you see, I will just throw in the word
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.000]   because interrupt someone sometimes.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.440]   And because I've done that, they will go into the depth and the reasons
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.160]   of what they did and why they did it.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.720]   And so that's what it's about.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.320]   Sometimes it's about asking a question.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.800]   Sure.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.160]   But often it's not asking a question.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520]   It's just a one word transition that I've handed to them and they
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   can't help, but use to explain why.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.320]   Why don't you want to go to school tomorrow?
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.560]   It's kind of challenging.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   Now they're put on the spot.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.160]   They've said something and I say, because now there's an expectation that they're
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.520]   of course going to finish the sentence.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.720]   Because my friend doesn't like me because my friend is moved on to first grade and
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.680]   I'm still in kindergarten, whatever it is, it comes out naturally.
