[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.120]   And this is the seminar on Spurgeon,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.840]   Learning from the Prince of Preachers,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.780]   that's the title they gave me.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.920]   I've done so many seminars and conferences
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.880]   where I've talked about Spurgeon,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.440]   it was hard for me to come up with something new.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.040]   But this is one I've never done, at least in America.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.760]   I did a lecture like this, similar to this,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.320]   in London a couple of years ago.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.900]   But this will be one, if you've heard me speak on Spurgeon,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900]   you probably haven't heard this yet.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.520]   And I decided what I would do is survey his lectures
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   to his students, 'cause it's such a rich source of material.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   This idea came to me last summer,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   popped up on my Twitter feed,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.940]   an announcement that Spurgeon's College in London
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.940]   had installed Rick Warren as their first honorary chancellor.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.660]   (audience groaning)
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.400]   That was my response, too.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.400]   And in fact, the reaction from evangelicals on Twitter,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.920]   understandably, included scores of people
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.400]   who expressed consternation about that.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.600]   Anyone who knows anything about Rick Warren,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.520]   I think, understands that he is the anti-Spurgeon.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.040]   Warren and Spurgeon are just poles apart
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.720]   on practically everything,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.320]   ranging from their contradictory philosophies of ministry
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.840]   to the virtually opposite theological points of view
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.700]   that undergird what are really antithetical approaches
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.920]   to preaching and church leadership and really everything.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.540]   And I was amused by some of the comments
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.280]   that popped up on Twitter.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520]   Here are some of the tweets I collected.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   I'll just read 'em to you.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.780]   I didn't write these.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   So if they sound really snarky,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.400]   don't blame me for that.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.520]   I'll read three or four of the tweets.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.960]   This is an embarrassment to Spurgeon's name and legacy.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.200]   I said amen to that one.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.720]   Another guy writes, "What an absolute kick of dust
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.280]   "in the face of Charles Spurgeon."
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   And then somebody else goes, "Spurgeon would not like this."
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.840]   That's an understatement.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800]   And my favorite, he goes,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   "Spurgeon would roast this compromiser like a London broil."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   And of course, all those comments are exactly right.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.520]   If Spurgeon could come back to the college he founded,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   I'm absolutely certain he would ask them
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   to take his name off of it.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   Rick Warren is the living embodiment
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   of everything Spurgeon opposed
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.600]   in his philosophy of ministry,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.280]   in the way he handles biblical texts and deals with doctrine,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.360]   in the way he deliberately ignores or glosses over
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   all of the potentially offensive aspects of gospel truth,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   and especially in the way he seeks to befriend
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.800]   and impress the secular world.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.000]   And can we be honest?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.780]   Virtually everything Rick Warren does as a pastor
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.580]   is antithetical to what Spurgeon said pastors should do.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.160]   He's the anti-Spurgeon.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.440]   He represents exactly what Spurgeon did not want
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.360]   his own pastoral students to become,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.120]   and that's not mere guesswork on my part.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.640]   Spurgeon left us a very clear record
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.920]   of what he taught his college students
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.600]   back when the pastor's college
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.200]   didn't yet have his name on it.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   But it reflects his biblical and theological convictions
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.640]   in what was taught there during his lifetime.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.180]   He lectured to his ministerial students at the college
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.940]   on every Friday, usually on Friday,
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.000]   and about 30 of his lectures have been preserved for us
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.600]   in a volume that, as far as I know,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.000]   has never been out of print.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   It's called Lectures to My Students.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.000]   And the original version of this collection
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   was published in stages over several years' time
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.560]   in, I said stages, four thin volumes.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.200]   It's now one thick volume,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.320]   but you'll find some later editions
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.780]   that included only three of those four volumes
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.800]   because in Spurgeon's own reckoning,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   commenting and commentaries belonged in this set.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.160]   That was actually volume two that he released,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.960]   his book on commenting and commentaries.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.000]   And if you include that in the series,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.400]   then it's four volumes.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.760]   But it usually, that one is separated out.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   Commenting and commentaries is an annotated bibliography
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.800]   of commentaries, and it has just two lectures in it,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   two lectures and then this really important bibliography
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.000]   of the commentaries that Spurgeon read and used.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.760]   But the two lectures are titled,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.520]   one is a chat about commentaries,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.080]   and the other one is on commenting.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   And so in chronological terms,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.800]   that volume, commenting and commentaries,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.760]   was the second volume published.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.460]   And as I said, these days it's usually published
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.800]   as a standalone volume separate
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   from Lectures to My Students.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.400]   So if you buy the current one volume edition
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.680]   of Lectures to My Students,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.580]   you've actually got three of the four volumes.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.320]   And if you want the fourth volume,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.920]   get Commenting and Commentaries.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.440]   Volume one was published in 1875,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.240]   and it contained 13 of Spurgeon's best lectures.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.060]   Volume two then was Commenting and Commentaries.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.640]   It was published exactly a year later.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.620]   Volume three came out the following year.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.940]   So it looked like it was gonna be a series
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.640]   of books every year.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.120]   But after volume three, the series stood at three volumes,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.760]   literally for 20 years, until the fourth volume,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.360]   which is also sometimes published as a standalone volume.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.480]   It was called The Art of Illustration.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.920]   And it was published in 1897,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.300]   that's five years after Spurgeon died.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.400]   And if you can find the original edition,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.600]   its title page says Lectures to My Students,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.880]   and the subtitle is The Art of Illustration.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.020]   And by the time it was published,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.020]   Commenting and Commentaries had secured its position
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.300]   as a standalone reference work.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.040]   So the series was already being published then
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   as just a three-volume set.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.780]   So I say all that because it's confusing.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.900]   You'll find in used bookstores, sometimes a single volume,
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.640]   sometimes the three-volume set,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.140]   sometimes, you know, just two volumes,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.800]   and just so you know what you're getting.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.200]   The Art of Illustration, then,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.520]   was the final book in the series,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.240]   and it was the only one of the four volumes
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.480]   that was published posthumously.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.400]   It was put together by Spurgeon's private secretary,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.040]   Joseph Harold, who assembled this final set of lectures
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.540]   around the theme of sermon illustrations.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.020]   And Harold says that Spurgeon was actually working
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.320]   on that volume before he died,
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.520]   and he was the one who gave it the title,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.320]   The Art of Illustration.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.160]   Lectures to My Students, then,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.180]   is generally published as a single volume these days,
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.020]   like I said, and you might find,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.180]   if you compare it with the table of contents
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.320]   that I'm going to talk about,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.160]   or if you look at the old volumes,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.860]   the order of the lectures has been rearranged.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.800]   But then the question always comes up,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.380]   how were these lectures recorded?
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.640]   How were these, how do we know
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.960]   what Spurgeon said in a lecture?
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.520]   Because one of the sad facts of Spurgeon's life and career
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.440]   is that although recording technology existed,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.720]   nobody ever thought to record Spurgeon's voice.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.460]   So today, there is not a single recording,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.240]   we don't know what Spurgeon sounded like,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.800]   other than the descriptions that were written of his voice.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.680]   If you look it up on the internet,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.080]   you'll find a recording of one of his sons,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   and always attached to it is a bunch of people saying,
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.900]   well, people said he sounded just like his dad.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.120]   He might have had the same regional accent as his dad,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.160]   but his voice can't possibly be like Charles Spurgeon,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.320]   because it's a soft voice,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.680]   and Spurgeon actually could project his voice enough
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.720]   that without any kind of amplification,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.060]   he could speak to a crowd of 20,000 people,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.680]   and be heard on the outer edges of the crowd.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.400]   I don't even know how that's possible,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.420]   but Spurgeon did it, and George Whitfield did it,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.680]   and I don't think I've ever heard
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   of anyone else who could do that, but Spurgeon did.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.960]   Anyway, there was no recording ever made of his lectures,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.000]   but what happened was there were always stenographers
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.740]   present whenever Spurgeon spoke to audiences of any size,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.400]   and the lecture hall at the pastor's college
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.120]   was no exception to that,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.300]   so there are undoubtedly many lectures besides these
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.780]   that did not get transcribed and published.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.840]   Some of them occasionally were transcribed and published
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.200]   in his magazine, The Sword and the Trowel,
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.960]   and some of those didn't make it
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.120]   into this collection in the books.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.800]   I'm gonna talk about one of those at the end,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.560]   but anyway, I can't imagine that Spurgeon
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   had tons of time to prepare lectures for pastoral students,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.440]   and I can't find any record of how he did this,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.920]   whether he spoke from notes when he delivered these lectures
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.240]   or whether it was just all off the top of his head.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.120]   I imagine, knowing how Spurgeon worked,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.040]   that if he used notes at all, they were minimal,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.760]   because, of course, that's how he preached as well,
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.060]   usually from no more than a bare outline,
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.480]   sometimes that he would record
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.320]   on the back of an old envelope,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.240]   and the introduction to volume one is a short,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.220]   well, it's an introduction,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.960]   but it really is the length of a short chapter
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.240]   titled Introduction and Apology,
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   and although there's no reason, really,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   for Spurgeon to have to apologize for anything,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.760]   he explains the reason that the style of these lectures,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   which he perceives as unusually informal,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.680]   and he sort of apologizes for that.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.260]   They're not as formal as he would be when he preached.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.780]   In fact, he says it in these words.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.620]   I'll quote him.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.440]   He writes, "My college lectures are colloquial,
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.200]   familiar, full of anecdote, often humorous.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.880]   They are purposely made so to suit the occasion.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.960]   At the end of the week, I meet the students
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.800]   and find them weary with sterner studies,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.160]   and I judge it best to be as lively and interesting
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.640]   in my prelections as I well can be," he said.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.280]   "I am as much at home with my young brethren
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.120]   as in the bosom of my family,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.400]   and therefore I speak without restraint,"
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.640]   which is what makes these lectures, frankly,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.880]   the most interesting.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.440]   It's probably the most interesting material
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.280]   you can read from Spurgeon,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   and I'm always sorry that it doesn't get read well enough.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.040]   I think a lot of people overlook it
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.880]   because you think lectures to my students,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.720]   that's gonna be academic.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.580]   I don't need to read that.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.040]   It's really some of the most fun
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.700]   of Spurgeon's material to read,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.160]   but in his own assessment,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.760]   these lectures you might call Spurgeon unplugged.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.400]   You know, he's speaking here freely without filters,
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   without, you know, the normal restraint
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.960]   that he would use in his public speaking,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.600]   and that explains, I think,
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.440]   some of the charm of these lectures.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.480]   They're very instructive when it comes
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.160]   to understanding Spurgeon's philosophy of ministry
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.920]   and his preaching style and his extraordinary giftedness.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.240]   In fact, it's, I think, fairly certain
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   that Spurgeon's busy schedule would not have permitted him
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   to do a lot of special research
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.520]   and preparation for these lectures,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   and yet, as is always true of Spurgeon's speaking,
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.040]   it's full of insight.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.760]   He loads these lectures with references
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.780]   to classical literature and history
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.920]   and advanced theological observations,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.280]   and of course, lots of biblical references.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.160]   There's a lot more humor, as he says,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.540]   in these lectures than Spurgeon would use in his sermons.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.720]   There are funny things in his sermons, too,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.080]   and he's well-known that he tried
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.280]   to restrain his humor when he spoke.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.780]   Once a lady came and scolded him and said,
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.800]   "You shouldn't say funny things like that
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.640]   "when you're preaching.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.920]   "Preaching is serious business."
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.880]   And he said, "Madam, if you knew all the humorous thoughts
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.240]   "that come into my mind while I'm preaching,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.780]   "you would congratulate me on my restraint."
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.720]   But he felt free to be a lot more candid
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.760]   when he's lecturing in these ministerial students,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.280]   so his criticisms are a little harsher,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   his humor is a lot more, there's a lot more of it.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.780]   Still, I wouldn't say, reading these,
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.520]   that these lectures are colloquial,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.640]   that was the word he used,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.000]   or they're not breezy, informal talks.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.800]   He weaves a lot more literary and historical references
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.120]   than he would use in his sermons.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.760]   He clearly expected these ministerial students
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.300]   to think and listen at a very high level.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.640]   And so I want to run through with you
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.520]   a list of the 13 lectures in that first set
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.760]   of lectures to my student.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.200]   I wanna kinda summarize 'em for you.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.880]   I'll give you the titles of all 13 lectures in order,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.040]   and I'll summarize the main point of each lecture,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.360]   and if time permits, I'll give you a few salient quotes
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.280]   from each lecture, and I hope this'll be enough
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   to give you the flavor of these lectures,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.780]   because I want to try to motivate you
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.500]   to read these for yourselves.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.960]   They're really edifying and well worth your time,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.580]   and I hope this'll motivate you for that.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.680]   So we'll cover the first of these four volumes,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.780]   and remember, there are two or three more volumes
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.800]   after that, depending on how you count,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.440]   but I'm pretty sure that a survey of this first volume
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.040]   is gonna give you an appetite for more.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.440]   And then at the end, I want to mention
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.040]   this one other lecture that was not included
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.620]   in any of the four volumes that Spurgeon conceived
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.880]   in this set, but first, let's survey volume one.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.800]   I mentioned that this volume starts
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.920]   with Spurgeon's introduction and apology.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.440]   It's short, it's just six paragraphs.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.100]   Of course, knowing Spurgeon, these are long paragraphs,
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.740]   but it's about two pages in the original,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.800]   two pages of fine type in the original edition,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.980]   in which he gives the first ever hint
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.800]   that his book Commenting and Commentaries was in the works.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.420]   By the way, if you don't have that, you should.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.180]   People always ask me, how do you choose
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.920]   the commentaries you use when you study?
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.540]   And I always say, the first place I go
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.900]   is to Spurgeon's Commenting and Commentaries
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.020]   and see what he recommends.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.780]   And frankly, I'm maybe a little jaded in this,
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.580]   but I think older commentaries are almost always better
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.060]   than the ones that have been published in the 20th century.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.140]   That's my personal opinion.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.540]   Anyway, at the end of this introduction, he writes this,
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.800]   quote, should this publication succeed,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.100]   I hope very soon to issue in similar form
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.260]   a work on commenting containing a full catalog
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.780]   of commentaries, and also I'd like to print
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.340]   a second set of lectures.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.620]   So he hints that he doesn't expect his book
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.380]   Commenting and Commentaries to find
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.020]   a very enthusiastic reception.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.060]   He says this, persons interested in our subjects
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.020]   are not numerous enough to secure
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.700]   a very large circulation.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.020]   Now he was wrong, of course.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.940]   Commenting and Commentaries sold more than 10,000 copies
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.640]   in its first printing in the first year alone,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.860]   which made it a remarkable success.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.700]   And I think Spurgeon would probably be amazed
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.380]   to know that it has been reprinted
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.060]   and reprinted more times than I can count
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.060]   in the 20th century.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.340]   And like I said, speaking personally,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.320]   I still use it as the first resource I check
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.340]   when I'm trying to decide what commentaries to buy
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.100]   on whatever new passage I'm going to study.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.840]   So, lecture one in the first series
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.900]   is called The Minister's Self-Watch.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.140]   And in some ways, this may be the most important lecture
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.720]   in the whole series.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.500]   It is a must read for anyone in church leadership,
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.980]   where Spurgeon urges his students to guard their hearts
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.620]   and their personal habits.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.940]   He says this, quote, it will be in vain for me
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.060]   to stock my library or organize societies
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.980]   or project schemes if I neglect the culture of myself.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.120]   For books and agencies and systems
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.560]   are only remotely the instruments of my holy calling.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.980]   My own spirit, soul, and body
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.660]   are my nearest machinery for sacred service.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.380]   My spiritual faculties and my inner life
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.240]   are my battle axe and my weapons of war.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.660]   And he cautions then about poisoning your life
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.220]   with secret sins or double-mindedness.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.980]   And he points out that if you do this,
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.380]   it will inevitably corrupt your preaching.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.060]   If the channel is full of poison,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.180]   how can it distribute the water of life?
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.020]   He says this, quote, it's a terrible thing
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.820]   when the healing balm of the gospel loses its efficacy
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.540]   through the blunderer who administers it.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.440]   You all know the injurious effects frequently produced
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.360]   on water through flowing through leaden pipes.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.340]   Even so, the gospel itself in flowing through men
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.660]   who are spiritually unhealthy may be debased
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.340]   until it grows injurious to their hearers.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.720]   It is to be feared that Calvinistic doctrine
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.620]   becomes most evil teaching when it is set forth
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.200]   by men of ungodly lives and exhibited
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.100]   as if it were a cloak for licentiousness.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.420]   And Arminianism, on the other hand,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.460]   with its wide sweep of the offer of mercy,
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.540]   may do most serious damage to the souls of men
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.620]   if the careless tone of the preacher
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.220]   leads his hearers to believe
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.780]   that they can repent whenever they please
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.860]   and that therefore no urgency surrounds the gospel message.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.500]   My favorite sentence in the lecture is a short one.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.800]   He says, "Beware of being shoddy preachers."
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.460]   It's a convicting lecture about the high calling
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.320]   of being a pastor, and I can't read it without wondering
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.060]   if there might have been a few men in that lecture hall
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.820]   when he delivered this who subsequently withdrew
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.660]   from the pastor's college
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.720]   and decided to pursue a different calling,
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.620]   because he will leave you with a definite understanding
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.860]   that the calling of being a pastor is a high calling,
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.780]   and if you're not worthy of it, you shouldn't do it.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.100]   If you're not called to it,
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.380]   you shouldn't pursue that vocation.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.620]   Here's one more line from that first lecture.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.740]   Quote, "Many are disqualified for office in the church
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.060]   "who are well enough as simple members."
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.180]   He's saying you don't have to be a pastor or an elder
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.080]   in order to have a fruitful ministry in the local church.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.860]   To those who would be pastors, he says this.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.600]   Quote, "When we say to you, my dear brethren,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.160]   "take care of your life, we mean be careful
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.660]   "even of the minutia of your character.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.760]   "Avoid little debts and unpunctuality."
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.080]   I'm convicted 'cause I was almost late here.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.340]   "Avoid gossiping and nicknaming and petty quarrels
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.260]   "and all of those other little vices
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.440]   "which fill the ointment with flies."
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.220]   And especially, he says, you should never ever fail
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.040]   to keep your word, keep your commitments.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.500]   He says, quote, "We cannot be too careful.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   "Truth must not only be in us, it must also shine from us."
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.400]   And one more point, by the way, in this lecture,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.120]   Spurgeon warns strongly against the practice
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.960]   of restoring men to public ministry
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.360]   after they have been disqualified because of moral turpitude.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.720]   He says, quote, "I hold very stern opinions
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.980]   "with regard to Christian men
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.540]   "who have fallen into gross sin.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.920]   "I recognize they may be truly converted
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.660]   "and they may be with mingled hope and caution
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.580]   "received back into the church,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.940]   "but I question, I gravely question
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.040]   "whether a man who has grossly sinned
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.700]   "should be restored to the pulpit.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.880]   "As John Angel James remarks,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.460]   "when a preacher of righteousness
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.540]   "has stood in the way of sinners,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.880]   "he should never again open his lips
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.460]   "in the great congregation
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.880]   "until his repentance is as notorious as his sins."
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.380]   Spurgeon says that in such cases,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.100]   he doubts whether the man was really called
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.020]   to public ministry in the first place.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.980]   In his words, quote, "Having been once tried,
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.360]   "they have proved themselves to have too little grace
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.640]   "to stand the crucial test of ministerial life."
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.840]   He comes back to that same theme in lecture two.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.580]   Lecture two is titled, "The Call to the Ministry,"
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.960]   and he's answering the question,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.100]   how can students know for sure
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.980]   that they are called to full-time ministry?
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.440]   And he says this, "The first sign of the heavenly call
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.260]   "is an intense, all-absorbing desire for the work."
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.860]   Other qualifications he names are
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.460]   that the man must be able to teach,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.180]   he must meet the other qualifications for eldership
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.020]   that are given in Scripture,
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.100]   and then third, he says,
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.220]   the man who is truly called to ministry
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.580]   must see a measure of conversion work
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.840]   going on under his efforts.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.100]   He's saying, if you're not already clearly winning souls
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.460]   in your capacity as a lay Christian,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.900]   what makes you think you're called to full-time ministry,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.080]   or even short-term missions?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.660]   And then fourth, he says,
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.680]   you should see the signs of a fruitful response
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   to your preaching.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.220]   And in fact, one other thing about this second lecture,
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.020]   before I move on beyond it,
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.980]   when Rick Warren was appointed
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.360]   Chancellor of Spurgeon's College,
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.780]   a number of people pointed out
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.540]   that Rick Warren's well-known advocacy
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.940]   for ordaining women to pastoral ministry
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.140]   and making women preach,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.460]   that is seriously at odds with Spurgeon's views
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.240]   on the qualifications for ministry.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.860]   But Rick Warren himself,
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.900]   who evidently doesn't know a whole lot
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.000]   about what Spurgeon actually believed,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.480]   he published a statement on that,
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.040]   and it said this, quote,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.880]   "The 167-year-old Spurgeon's College in London
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.280]   "inducted me as their chancellor,
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.680]   "telling me that my views on ordination
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.760]   "are identical to Spurgeon's."
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.840]   Well, the person who told him that
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   was the president of Spurgeon's College,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.380]   who currently is a woman.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.980]   So, that's how things are going there,
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.280]   but Spurgeon lays that claim to rest
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.900]   in the very first paragraph of this lecture
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.040]   on the call to ministry.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.600]   He points out that there are many ways
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.640]   to serve the Lord and serve the church
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.500]   and have a fruitful ministry in the church.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.220]   He says, quote, "Our service to Christ
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.480]   "need not take the particular form of preaching.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.460]   "Certainly, in some cases, it must not.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.120]   "As, for instance, in the case of females,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.320]   "whose public teaching is expressly prohibited."
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.760]   That's in the first paragraph.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.240]   And he cites, of course, 1 Timothy 2.12
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.440]   and 1 Corinthians 14.34,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   and if that's not clear enough,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.480]   and in case anyone is confused by the false claim
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.440]   that Spurgeon was just fine
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.580]   with ordaining women as pastors,
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.280]   listen to what Spurgeon said
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.760]   in a sermon he preached on Sunday morning,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.780]   April 19th, 1885.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.520]   And, trigger warning here,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.600]   by today's standards,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.900]   this kind of blunt candor is not politically correct,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.560]   but Spurgeon said this, not me.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.020]   So, he said this, quote,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.380]   "Women are best when they are quiet."
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.540]   He said, "I share the Apostle Paul's feelings
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.760]   "when he bade women be silent in the assembly,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.440]   "yet there is work for holy women."
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.680]   And we read of Peter's wife's mother
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.720]   that she arose and ministered to Christ.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.580]   She did what she could and what she should.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.280]   She arose and ministered to him.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.000]   Some people can do nothing that they are allowed to do,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.200]   but they waste their energies in lamenting
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.520]   that they're not called on to do other people's work.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.760]   Blessed are they who do what they should do.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.120]   It's better to be a good housewife or nurse
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.760]   or domestic servant than to be a powerless preacher
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.500]   or a graceless talker.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:10.060]   She did not arise and prepare a lecture or preach a sermon,
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.240]   but she arose and prepared a supper,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.880]   and that's what she was fitted to do.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.080]   Was she not a housewife?
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.900]   As a housewife, let her serve the Lord.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.260]   Again, that doesn't sound very tactful by today's standards,
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.080]   but in fact, you couldn't get by.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   If you said that on Twitter nowadays,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.680]   you'd almost certainly get ratioed,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.660]   but I think that excerpt should be sufficient at least
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.320]   to show that Spurgeon was not singing
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.660]   from the same songbook as Rick Warren.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.260]   Lecture three in that first series
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.480]   is The Preacher's Private Prayer,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.200]   and it's another extremely convicting lecture.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.720]   I'm warning, you read this,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.200]   you will feel like Spurgeon has stepped on your toes.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.280]   Here's just a sample.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.080]   He says, quote, "Among all the formative influences
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.520]   "which go to make up a man honored of God in the ministry,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.760]   "I know of none more mighty than his own familiarity
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.680]   "with the mercy seat.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.200]   "All that a college course can do for a student
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.000]   "is coarse and external compared with the spiritual
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.600]   "and delicate refinement obtained by communion with God.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.800]   "Prayer is the tool of the great potter
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.140]   "by which he molds the vessel.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.760]   "All of our libraries and studies are mere emptiness
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.520]   "compared with our prayer closets."
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:37.120]   And then in lecture four, he stays with the theme of prayer.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.560]   The third lecture was about private prayer,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.600]   and number four is about public prayer.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.280]   And Spurgeon opposed the idea of writing out a prayer
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.860]   and reading it.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.700]   He didn't like that.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.580]   He believed that a pastoral prayer should be extemporaneous
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   and not just, to use his words, liturgical devotion.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.100]   And he didn't think that exaggerated eloquence
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.300]   was a plus in praying.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.740]   He said this, quote, "Fine prayers are generally
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.980]   "very wicked prayers.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.400]   "In the presence of the Lord of hosts,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.460]   "it ill becomes a sinner to parade the feathers
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.880]   "and finery of tawdry speech
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   "with the view of winning applause from his fellow mortals.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.380]   "Hypocrites who dare to do this have their reward,
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.600]   "but it is a reward to be dreaded."
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.020]   And then there was a particular kind of vain repetition
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.660]   that he deplored as well.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.660]   He said this, quote, "Another fault equally to be avoided
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.260]   "in prayer is an unhallowed and sickening superabundance
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.560]   "of endearing words.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.720]   "When dear Lord and blessed Lord and sweet Lord
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.320]   "come over and over again as vain repetitions,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.980]   "they are among the worst of blots.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.060]   "I must confess, I might feel no revulsion in my mind
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.180]   "to the words, dear Jesus, if they fell from the lips
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.500]   "of a true Puritan, but when I hear fond
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.940]   "and familiar expressions hackneyed by persons
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.860]   "not at all remarkable for spirituality,
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.540]   "I'm inclined to wish that they could,
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.140]   "in some way or another, come to a better understanding
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.560]   "of the true relation that exists between man and God.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.880]   "The word dear has come from daily use
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.780]   "to be so common and so small, and in some cases,
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.680]   "so silly and affected a monosyllable,
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.220]   "that interlarding one's prayers with it
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.280]   "is not to edification."
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.660]   Now, I heartily agree with all of that,
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.940]   but I have to confess, I don't agree with everything
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.700]   Spurgeon says in this lecture.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.540]   I don't think a written prayer,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.740]   if it's delivered meaningfully, is a bad thing.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.980]   I think it's actually better to ponder
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.360]   what you want to say and word it very carefully beforehand
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.700]   than to be groping for words and stuttering around
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.940]   when you're trying to be extemporaneous.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.020]   Nevertheless, in fact, the first Spurgeon sermon
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.220]   I ever read was a sermon titled
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.540]   "Order and Argument in Prayer,"
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.340]   which is a phrase he borrows from the book of Job,
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.820]   where Job says he's going to plead his case before God
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.780]   and he's gonna order his thoughts beforehand,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.420]   and Spurgeon is saying, "Before you go to God in prayer,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.480]   "you should at least think through
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.880]   "what you're going to say."
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   So, in my mind, it's easier to do that and write it out
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.160]   than to make myself try to extemporaneously come up
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.520]   with the right thing while I'm praying.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.940]   Personal preference, I don't think what he's giving here,
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.940]   even Spurgeon would intend to be a legalistic measure,
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.980]   but I definitely agree with the spirit of what he's saying,
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.120]   that sort of formal liturgical devotion is worthless.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.140]   And I emphatically agree with the part of this lecture
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.740]   where Spurgeon says, "Do not let your prayer be long."
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.620]   And he adds this, "It is not required of you
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.580]   "to prolong your speech until everyone is longing
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.700]   "to hear the word amen."
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.080]   Can I get an amen?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.500]   Anyway, lecture five, then, is titled,
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   "Sermons," with then a colon, "Sermons, Their Matter."
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.380]   And I love this lecture.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:32.180]   Spurgeon didn't model the kind of expository preaching
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.900]   that we here at Grace Church recommend and encourage.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.500]   He wasn't the sort of expositor
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.100]   that we teach pastors to be,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.500]   but he acknowledged that expository preaching
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.380]   is superior to any other approach.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.520]   And nevertheless, he followed a style of preaching
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.180]   that was more common and more conventional
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.920]   in his generation.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.060]   But this lecture is really full of good advice
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.620]   for biblical expositors, starting with his opening words.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.840]   Here's the very first sentence of this lecture, quote,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.580]   "Sermons should have real teaching in them,
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.780]   "and their doctrine should be solid,
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.180]   "substantial, and abundant."
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.140]   It's the opposite, again, of not only Rick Warren,
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.700]   but most preaching gurus these days,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.940]   who say, you know, don't load it
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.540]   with too much doctrine or teaching.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.060]   Tell stories, make it interesting,
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.640]   meet people's felt needs.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.900]   None of that in Spurgeon.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.920]   He says it should be full of doctrine.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.120]   And he hammers the storytelling,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.240]   sort of moralistic, motivational,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   super-contextualized approach
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.760]   that most megachurch pastors today
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.240]   would recommend and practice.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.960]   In fact, here's an interesting contrast,
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.740]   not to keep picking on Rick Warren,
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.500]   but he's fun to pick on.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.640]   In The Purpose-Driven Church,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.120]   Rick Warren says this, quote,
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.840]   "The ground we have in common with unbelievers
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.880]   "is not the Bible, but our common needs,
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.420]   "hurts, and interests as human beings.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.380]   "You cannot start with a text,
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.820]   "expecting the unchurched to be fascinated by it.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.840]   "You must first capture their attention,
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.240]   "and then move them slowly to the truth of God's word."
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.980]   So Warren is far more concerned with style
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.020]   than he is with content.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.760]   He wrote an entire book on ministry philosophy,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.160]   and in it, he has very little to say
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.560]   about the content of your message.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.120]   But what he does say is loaded with warnings
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.600]   not to be too biblical, or too doctrinal,
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.120]   or too challenging to the interests
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.320]   or preferences of unsaved people in the audience.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.160]   That's his view.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.040]   Here's Spurgeon's view by contrast.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   He says, quote, "The sermon should spring out of the text,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.900]   "and the more evidently that it does so, the better."
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.620]   He says, "Take care that your deliverances
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   "are always weighty, and full of really important teaching.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.120]   "Don't build with wood, hay, and stubble,
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.980]   "but with gold, silver, and precious stones."
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.220]   And he went on to condemn the notion
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.820]   that the pulpit is like a theater stage
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.580]   for the entertainment and amusement of unchurched people.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.260]   And in fact, in that connection,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.660]   he references an infamous 18th century preacher
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.700]   who actually he's introducing me to.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.620]   I'd never heard of this guy,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.980]   but apparently he attained some fame in his time.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.500]   John Henley, from the 1700s,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.980]   who literally moved his church to a theater
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.940]   in Lincoln Inn's fields in London,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.100]   and Henley became well-known
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.360]   for the sort of clownishness and buffoonery
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.640]   that he did from the pulpit.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.840]   One critic said of John Henley,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.220]   "Fluent nonsense trickles from his tongue."
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.840]   And the poet, the famous poet Alexander Pope
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.320]   called John Henley a zany, a zany, he says.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.700]   So I looked that up in the Oxford English Dictionary,
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.500]   and zany, when it's used as a noun like that,
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.000]   it refers to a comic performer attending on a clown.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.500]   Not a clown, but the sidekick of a clown, okay?
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.140]   Who he says, this is from the Oxford English Dictionary,
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.620]   he's a comic performer attending on a clown
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.140]   who imitates his master's acts
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.560]   in a ludicrously awkward way.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.020]   So as a preacher, you don't wanna be a zany,
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.540]   you don't wanna come across as a zany, okay?
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.420]   But this guy Henley, although ostensibly he was a pastor,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.400]   was a clown's clown,
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.660]   sort of the very worst kind of living, breathing farce.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.760]   In fact, look him up, John Henley,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.980]   you'll be amazed that stuff like that went on
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.720]   even in the 1700s.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   I think there may be a Wikipedia page about the guy.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   And if someone suggested to me
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.780]   that Rick Warren resembles John Henley
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.420]   more than he resembles Charles Spurgeon,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.780]   I wouldn't argue with you.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.700]   Don't be like that, Spurgeon says.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.280]   He says, quote, "We are on peril of our souls
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.060]   "bound to deal with the solemnities of eternity
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.940]   "with no earth-born topics."
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.900]   And again, this is a great lecture
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.300]   and it's filled with sound advice on preaching.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.100]   This is the antidote to most of the books
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.020]   on preaching and pastoral philosophy
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.740]   that you may have read in the 20th and 21st centuries.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.140]   Great lecture, but I gotta move on.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.640]   Lecture six is titled, "On the Choice of a Text."
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.460]   Now, it's well known, I think,
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.380]   that Spurgeon usually didn't even decide
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.260]   what text he would preach on each week
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.740]   until Saturday evening before Sunday morning.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.240]   Yeah, I emphatically do not recommend that approach.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.380]   But here's what Spurgeon says about it.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.840]   "What is the right text?
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.740]   "How do you know it?"
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.640]   He says, "We know it by the signs of a friend.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.620]   "When a verse gives your mind a hardy grip
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.020]   "from which you cannot release yourself,
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.520]   "you will need no further direction
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.100]   "as to your proper theme.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.560]   "Like the fish, you nibble at many baits,
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.500]   "but when the hook has fairly pierced you,
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.320]   "you will wander no more."
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.020]   Now, in my judgment, this is not Spurgeon's finest lecture,
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.660]   but even so, it's worth reading
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.380]   and it is filled with some helpful tidbits.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.620]   I don't need to say any more about it.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.720]   Again, I don't think it's the best lecture in the book
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.560]   and since we recommend expository preaching
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.040]   where you follow through a passage week after week,
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.400]   it's kind of a moot point, but whatever.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.600]   Lecture seven is titled "On Spiritualizing."
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.960]   That's the title, and here Spurgeon talks
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.640]   about spiritualizing the meaning of scripture.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.880]   It may shock you to learn that he didn't think
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.580]   it was always a bad thing to find a spiritual meaning
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.940]   through allegory or symbolism in a biblical text,
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.600]   but nevertheless, he was emphatic in saying
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.440]   this should not be the rule in hermeneutics.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.820]   He would stress that the meaning of scripture
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.240]   is not a coded message where the true sense
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.100]   is a hidden spiritual meaning that's deeper and richer
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.820]   than what the human author actually had in mind.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.180]   That wasn't his view, but on the other hand,
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.220]   he didn't believe that it was safe to assume
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.020]   that there's never any symbolic meaning in the text,
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.300]   so he wouldn't rule out types and metaphors
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.180]   and allegorical symbolism like Paul uses
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.220]   in the book of Galatians.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.140]   He saw that as an unwarranted wooden literalism
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.740]   to rule that out completely, and in fact,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:05.060]   he called that a rule that is more fastidious than correct.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.980]   And again, I think I understand what he's driving at,
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.660]   but he isn't as clear as I wish he would be
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.820]   on where the boundaries lie.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.300]   But if you read this chapter, you can decide for yourself
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.260]   whether he's making a valid point.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.260]   He gives several humorous examples of over-spiritualizing,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.060]   and he also then suggests some examples
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.180]   of types and metaphors that, in his judgment,
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.360]   legitimize the occasional spiritualizing
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.580]   of a biblical text, and he does give this rule
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.140]   as a sound and necessary qualifier.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.080]   He says this, that the meaning of Scripture
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   is never merely spiritual, that Scripture is not,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.820]   in other words, a secret message,
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.680]   and therefore, he says, quote,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   "Never allow your audience to forget
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.780]   "that the narratives which you spiritualize are facts.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.760]   "They are not mere myths or parables.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.980]   "The first sense of the passage must never be drowned out
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.900]   "in the outflow of your imagination."
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.240]   And then he delivers this line, quote,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.100]   "It will be an ill day for the church
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.060]   "if the pulpit should ever appear to endorse
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.380]   "the skeptical hypothesis that Holy Scripture
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.560]   "is but the record of a refined mythology
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.080]   "in which globules of truth are dissolved
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.360]   "in seas of poetic and imaginary detail."
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.600]   He says that very poetically,
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.000]   but I hope you get the sense of what he's saying.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.960]   Now, moving on to lecture eight,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.440]   the title is On the Voice,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.080]   and here he has some valuable things to say
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.840]   about what was, at the time, a huge tendency.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.580]   It was the foolish practice of some preachers,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.720]   and it, in fact, I would say the besetting sin
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.620]   of all preachers in, almost all preachers
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.220]   in Victorian times in the Anglican Church,
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.680]   where they would use an affected pulpit voice.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.800]   They would deliver the sermon in a voice
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   that's nasally and pedantic and atonal and even effeminate.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.200]   He despised that kind of artificially,
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.960]   obviously artificial style.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.920]   He says this, quote, "Take care not to fall
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.960]   "into the habitual and common affectations
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.240]   "of the present day.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.880]   "Scarcely one man in a dozen in the pulpit
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.440]   "talks like a man."
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.280]   And there's some funny things in this lecture, by the way.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.520]   In the published edition, the book editor
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.560]   actually inserts some comments along the way,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.240]   apologizing for not being able to convey in print
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.200]   how Spurgeon imitated the vocal style
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.920]   that he was criticizing, you know.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.000]   Spurgeon hated, for example,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.200]   lisping and effeminate preachers.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.760]   He says this, quote, "There is another style
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.120]   "at which I beseech you not to laugh."
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.960]   And then I assume he slipped into the lisping style.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.100]   He said, "It's a method of enunciation
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.480]   "to be very ladylike and mincing
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.140]   "and delicate, servant-girlified."
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:19.080]   I'll leave the accent behind there.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.160]   He says, "It's a style that's dawdling and dundrearish."
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.280]   I don't know how else to describe it, he says.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   "We have, most of us, had the felicity
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.680]   "of hearing these or some others
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.480]   "of the extensive genus of falsettos
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.500]   "and high stilts and affectations."
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.960]   High stilts, that would be high-heeled shoes.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.380]   So he's caricaturing this effeminate style
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.760]   as if it's coming from preachers who,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.740]   you know, cross-dressers and stuff.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.600]   And in fact, he wasn't the only one that did that.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.640]   Some of the cartoons in the newspapers
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.240]   compared Spurgeon with his more manly style
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.440]   to the typical Anglican preacher
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.500]   who they portrayed as usually an old woman.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.340]   But he says, "I've heard very many
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.360]   "different varieties of this,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.200]   "from the fullness of the johnsonian
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.020]   "to the thinness of the little genteel whisper,
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.440]   "from the roaring bulls of Bashan
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.360]   "up to the chip, chip, chip of a chaffinch."
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.840]   I don't know what that is, some kind of bird.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.560]   He says, "I've been able to trace
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.640]   "some of our brethren to their forefathers,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.440]   "I mean their ministerial forefathers,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.640]   "from whom they first of all gathered
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.360]   "these heavenly, melodious, sanctified,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.840]   "in every way beautiful, but I must honestly add,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.600]   "detestable modes of speech.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.740]   "The undoubted order of their oratorical pedigree
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.460]   "is as follows.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.400]   "Chip, which was the son of Lisp,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.580]   "which was the son of Simper,
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.820]   "which was the son of Dandy,
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.860]   "which was the son of Affectation, or Wobbler,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.920]   "which was the son of Grandios,
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.360]   "which was the son of Pomposity,
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.380]   "the same as the father of many sons."
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.220]   And he says, "Understand that where even
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.460]   "these horrors of sound are natural,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.440]   "I do not condemn them.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.400]   "Let every creature speak in its own tongue,
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.860]   "but the fact is that in nine cases out of 10,
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.500]   "these sacred brogues, which I hope
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.580]   "will soon be dead languages,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.640]   "are unnatural and strained."
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.840]   He says, "I am persuaded that these tones
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.360]   "and semitones and monotones are Babylonian.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   "They are not at all the Jerusalem dialect,
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.320]   "for the Jerusalem dialect has this one
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.840]   "distinguishing mark, that it is a man's own
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.560]   "mode of speech, and it is the same
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.640]   "out of the pulpit as it is in it."
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.920]   I love that, and in fact, I have to say,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.040]   the thing that first struck me,
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.880]   more than, almost 50 years ago,
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.360]   when I first heard John MacArthur preach,
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.600]   was the fact that he didn't put on some,
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.920]   you know, typical preacher style,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.240]   which was popular even then.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.420]   That was back in the early 1970s.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.040]   I'd never really heard anyone preach
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.080]   just with a natural voice the way John MacArthur did,
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.800]   and it made it so much easier to understand,
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.040]   and as Spurgeon points out,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.680]   there's something manly about that,
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.880]   that I think we should cultivate.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.840]   Now I need to speed up, or I won't finish on time.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.480]   Lecture nine is titled Attention,
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.820]   and Spurgeon, as he explains in the opening remarks here,
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.320]   the topic of this lecture is how to obtain
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.000]   and retain the attention of our hearers,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.120]   and he says this is an inexplicably overlooked subject
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.080]   in most books on homiletics.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.640]   He probably wouldn't say that today
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   if he saw a lineup of 21st century books on church growth.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.920]   You know, books for preachers today
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.360]   don't talk about much else
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.160]   than how to hold the audience's attendant,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.400]   but to these days, most of the suggestions you get are bad.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.280]   Spurgeon wouldn't be in favor, obviously,
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.880]   of those who think playing secular music
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.360]   or putting on a carnival
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.120]   is a good way to attract people's attention.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.760]   He does have a few practical suggestions,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.920]   and he opens with them.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.980]   He talks, for example, about just opening the windows
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.040]   to the room and letting the foul air out of the building,
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   and then after thus clearing the air, he says this,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.960]   and this sums up his main point in this lecture.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.240]   Quote, "In order to get attention,
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.720]   "the first golden rule is
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.140]   "always say something worth hearing."
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.300]   Seems like a simple point, doesn't it?
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.520]   But I know from personal experience,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.280]   a lot of preachers don't get that.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.360]   And he further expounds on that point with several others.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.820]   He says, "Let your sermon be well-organized.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.780]   "Let the points be clearly arranged.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.260]   "Speak plainly.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.520]   "Don't make the introduction too long."
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.280]   That steps on my toes a little.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.200]   "Avoid speaking too long," and he goes on like that.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.560]   You can read the chapter.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.000]   There's lots of good advice for preachers here.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.700]   Lecture 10 is titled "The Faculty of Impromptu Speech,"
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.140]   and it may sound from the title
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:17.880]   like he's going to defend extemporaneous preaching
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.280]   rather than preaching from a full manuscript,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.240]   but he dispels that expectation in the opening sentence.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.640]   He writes, "We are not about to discuss the question
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.720]   "as to whether sermons should be written and read,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.680]   "or written, committed to memory, and repeated,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.840]   "or whether copious notes should be employed
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.680]   "or no notes at all.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.560]   "Neither of these is a subject now under consideration,
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.220]   "although we may incidentally allude to each of them,
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.520]   "but we are now to speak of extemporaneous speech
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   "in its truest and most thorough form,
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.820]   "speech impromptu, without special preparation,
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.780]   "without notes, without immediate forethought."
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.360]   And he starts by warning that no one should ever preach
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.800]   without adequate preparation.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.680]   He says this, "Unstudied thoughts coming from the mind
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.160]   "without previous research, without the subjects in hand
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.400]   "having been investigated at all,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.340]   "these must be of a very inferior quality,
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.860]   "even from the most superior men,
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.000]   "and as none of us would have the effrontery
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.400]   "to glorify ourselves as men of genius
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   "or wonders of erudition," he says,
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.960]   "I fear that our unpremeditated thoughts on most subjects
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.980]   "would not be remarkably worthy of attention.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.720]   "Churches are not to be held together
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.240]   "except by an instructive ministry.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   "A mere filling up of time with oratory will not suffice."
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.720]   And so at one point he says,
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.220]   "Do not attempt to be impromptu
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.200]   "unless you have well studied the theme."
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.560]   And so even though I like never to speak
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.720]   without a manuscript, I heartily agree
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.880]   with most of his advice in this lecture.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.000]   He does manage to take a backhanded slap
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.240]   at those of us who use a manuscript,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.480]   but then he makes a kind of concession
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.520]   to us manuscript users at the same time.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.360]   He says this, quote, "Very strongly do I warn all of you
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.760]   "against reading your sermons,
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.080]   "but I recommend as a most helpful exercise,
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.740]   "as a great aid towards attaining extemporizing power,
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.540]   "I recommend the frequent writing of them."
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.680]   And speaking personally, after I read what Spurgeon
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.600]   has to say about the pitfalls and the negative potential
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.040]   of careless extemporaneous speaking,
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.840]   I'm actually more committed than ever
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.000]   to the use of a manuscript.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.680]   I'm a pretty good writer, but I'm a lousy preacher.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.580]   So I just don't have the fluidity of mind
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.680]   and the speedy recall that is required
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.400]   to speak without having in front of me
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.280]   a written reminder of what I want to say.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.120]   But nevertheless, this is a good chapter.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.840]   It's full of advice that even us manuscript users
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.860]   will benefit from.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.280]   Lecture 11 is titled The Minister's Fainting Fits,
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.960]   and this is a famous one because this is one of the rare
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   firsthand resources that gives us insight
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   into Spurgeon's struggle with depression.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.640]   I did a lecture on this last year here at Grace Church
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.160]   on Spurgeon's chronic depression.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.600]   He struggled with depression more than you would ever know
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.400]   from reading his sermons or even reading his biographies,
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   but he was constantly beset with emotional depression
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.380]   and discouragement and physical weariness,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.040]   and he discusses several of the causes
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.920]   of ministerial melancholy,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.520]   and he notes that downheartedness
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.160]   actually has some benefits too.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.200]   So it's an encouraging lecture to read.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.480]   He says, for example, quote,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.780]   "By all the castings down of his servants,
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:09.040]   "God is glorified, for they are led to magnify him
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.660]   "when he sets them on their feet,
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.480]   "and even while they are prostrate
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.760]   "in the dust of their faith, it yields him praise.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.540]   "They speak all the more sweetly of his faithfulness,
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.140]   "and they are all the more firmly established in his love."
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.900]   And then here's the point he closes the lecture with,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.000]   quote, "The lesson of wisdom is,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.020]   "don't be dismayed by soul trouble.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.160]   "Count it no strange thing,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.760]   "but a part of ordinary ministerial experience.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.720]   "Should the power of depression be more than ordinary,
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.860]   "think not that all is over with your usefulness."
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.900]   In other words, if you fall into a deep depression,
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.800]   don't assume your ministry's over.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.520]   "Cast not away your confidence,
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.000]   "for it has great recompense of reward.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.860]   "Even if the enemy's foot is on your neck,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.520]   "expect to rise and overthrow him.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.180]   "Cast the burden of the present,
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.500]   "along with the sin of the past and the fear of the future,
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:08.620]   "cast it upon the Lord, who does not forsake his saints."
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.820]   And he includes in that paragraph
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.220]   an amazing string of reminders of biblical truth,
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:20.860]   showing why impediments and disappointments in the ministry
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.280]   shouldn't defeat or discourage us.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.420]   And in here then are his final words in that lecture,
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.860]   quote, "When we cannot see the face of our God,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.820]   "we learn to trust under the shadow of his wings."
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.660]   That's become kind of a famous quote of Spurgeon's.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.440]   When I can't see his face,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.160]   I'm still comfortable under the shadow of his wings.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.860]   Lecture 12, I'm almost getting to the end of the book.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.060]   Good, 'cause we're running short.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.980]   Lecture 12, "The Minister's Ordinary Conversation."
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.820]   And here his point is to encourage his students
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.920]   not to try to project an air of piety or superiority
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.640]   when they mingle with the flock.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.400]   He says, quote, "First and foremost, let me say,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.000]   "the pastor should give himself no ministerial airs,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.240]   "but avoid everything which is stilted or official
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.780]   "or fussy or pretentious."
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.420]   He tells the students, quote,
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:19.060]   "If you're characterized by too much ministerial starch,
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.480]   "I would earnestly advise you to go and wash in Jordan
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   "seven times and get the starch out of you,
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.820]   "every particle of it."
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.820]   He says, "I'm persuaded that one reason why our working men
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.220]   "so universally keep clear of ministers,"
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.660]   he's talking about blue collar people
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.220]   and why they don't like to hang around pastors,
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:44.220]   "is because they abhor their artificial and unmanly ways.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.880]   "If they saw us in the pulpit and out of it,
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.520]   "acting like real men and speaking naturally
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.940]   "like honest men, they would come around us."
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.340]   He says, quote, "We must have humanity
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.400]   "along with our divinity if we would win the masses.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.480]   "Everybody can see through affectations
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.280]   "and people are not likely to be taken in by them.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.220]   "Fling away your stilts, brethren, and walk on your feet.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   "Doff your ecclesiasticism and array yourselves in truth."
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.980]   And at the same time, he reminds us
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   that a minister should be aware that he is always on duty.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.220]   Even when you're in those mingling in social circles
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.940]   and you're still a pastor, you're still on duty.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.720]   He says, "A policeman or a soldier may be off duty,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.460]   "but a minister never is.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.920]   "Even in our recreations, we should still pursue
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.760]   "the great object of our lives, for we are called
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.140]   "to be diligent in season and out of season."
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.680]   And he also says that, and I like this statement,
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   "The doormat in front of your study should say welcome
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.820]   "and not beware the dog."
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.300]   I mean, I'd say I like that.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.020]   Actually, I think there's a doormat in front of my office
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.380]   that says beware the dog.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.080]   But he tells his students, "Be cheerful.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.500]   "Be a participant in conversations with your people."
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.780]   But he says, "Don't monopolize the conversation.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.180]   "Turn every conversation to profitable use.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.980]   "Don't court friendship with people
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.100]   "because of their wealth or status."
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.020]   He says these are the kinds of practical advice
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.020]   that he gives in this lecture.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.560]   And then in the last lecture of the book, Lecture 13,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   it's titled, "To Workers with Slender Apparatus."
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.700]   And what does that mean, you ask?
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.760]   Well, Spurgeon explains in his opening sentence.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.980]   He says, "What are ministers
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.380]   "who do have a slender apparatus?"
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.620]   I thought he was gonna talk about men
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.060]   whose voices don't project well or whatever,
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.020]   but here's how he defines it.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:50.180]   "By a slender apparatus, I mean they have few books
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.060]   "and little or no means wherewith to purchase more."
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.140]   So he's talking about the tools pastors use
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.620]   to prepare their sermons, the commentaries,
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.820]   and books of biblical history, resource books,
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   and Bible encyclopedias, and other vital Bible study aids.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.140]   Spurgeon says the idea of a pastor
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:15.400]   who can't afford to buy books, Spurgeon says, is abominable.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.900]   You'll love this lecture.
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.760]   He says, quote, "This is a state of things
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.060]   "which ought not to exist in any case.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.940]   "The churches ought to take care
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.980]   "that it should be rendered impossible
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.280]   "for a pastor not to be able to afford to buy books.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.480]   "Up to the highest measure of their ability,
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   "they should furnish their minister
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.260]   "not only with the food which is needful
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.000]   "to sustain the life of his body,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.900]   "but with mental nutriment
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.240]   "so that his soul may not be starved.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.060]   "A good library should be looked upon
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.760]   "as an indispensable part of church furniture,
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.720]   "and the deacons, whose business it is to serve tables,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.760]   "will be wise if, without neglecting the table of the Lord
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.820]   "or of the poor, and without diminishing the supplies
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:01.720]   "of the minister's dinner table,
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.080]   "they give an eye to his study table
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.200]   "and keep it supplied with new works
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.720]   "and standard books in fair abundance.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.340]   "It would be money well laid out,
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.500]   "and it would be productive far beyond expectation.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.920]   "Instead of waxing eloquent
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.340]   "upon the declining power of the pulpit,
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.000]   "leading men in the church should use the legitimate means
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.540]   "for improving its power by supplying the preacher
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.160]   "with food for thought.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.860]   "Put the whip into the manger,
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.220]   "is my advice to all grumblers."
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:33.740]   And if you're a minister in a small church environment,
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.380]   you will cheer him for saying that.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.800]   This is one of the most winsome of these 13 lectures,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.980]   because it shows Spurgeon's tender heart for,
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:47.740]   and his care for young pastors who had few resources.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.940]   And he encouraged his students by pointing out
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:53.500]   that you can actually do a whole lot with very little.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.380]   He cited Thomas Chalmers, who wrote a commentary
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.700]   on the entire Bible, and Spurgeon says this about him,
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.200]   "Dr. Chalmers used only the Concordance,
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.660]   "the Pictorial Bible, Poole's Synopsis,
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.340]   "Matthew Henry's Commentary,
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.460]   "and Robinson's Researches in Palestine."
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.500]   Five books, he says, "Those are the books I use,"
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.360]   he said to a friend, "All that is biblical is there.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.900]   "I have to do nothing besides that in my biblical study."
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.800]   And Spurgeon says, "This shows that those
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.040]   "who have unlimited stores at their command
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.460]   "yet find a few standard books to be sufficient."
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.860]   If Dr. Chalmers were now alive,
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.500]   he would probably take Thomson's Land and the Book
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.420]   instead of Robinson's Researches,
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.400]   and he might give up the Pictorial Bible
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.540]   for Kiddo's Daily Bible and Illustrations.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.660]   At least, I should recommend the alteration to most men,
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.540]   Spurgeon says, "This is clear evidence
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.880]   "that some eminent preachers have found
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.540]   "that they could do better with a few books
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.140]   "than with many when they're studying the scriptures."
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.500]   And I concur with that, I find the more commentaries
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:03.500]   I read through, sometimes the more muddled my thoughts are
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.540]   when I come to prepare the sermon.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.700]   I wanna get a good idea of the passage,
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.000]   I wanna have a clear outline
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.540]   before I start to write my own notes,
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:15.500]   but sometimes that's easier to do with a few resources.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   I've been in situations where I'm traveling or whatever,
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.620]   and the only thing I have are the few resources
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.100]   I can carry on my iPad,
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.520]   and I've found sometimes less is more.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.580]   By the way, this lecture, this last lecture
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.740]   is where Spurgeon made his famous comment
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.940]   about Matthew Henry's commentary,
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.520]   which I think is one of the most underrated commentaries
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.980]   of all, I think it's always very helpful.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.280]   Spurgeon said about Matthew Henry,
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.320]   "No better investment can be made by any minister
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.820]   "than that peerless exposition."
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.620]   Get it, if you sell your coat to buy it.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.900]   [audience laughing]
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.180]   And he tells him, I like this part too,
[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.680]   if they have to borrow books, he says,
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.460]   "Be sure you return them quickly and in good condition
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.180]   "to their rightful owners," which is wise counsel.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.860]   I wish some people who had borrowed my books
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.260]   had heeded that advice.
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   But anyway, that's a speedy overview of,
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.880]   are we out of time already?
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.260]   Okay, so I'm not gonna get into the coda of this.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.460]   I have five more pages of notes,
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.280]   which out of respect to you guys, I'm gonna skip.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   But that's a speedy overview of my series one
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.400]   in Spurgeon's lecture to my student.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.620]   And I'll quit at that point, okay?
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   Thank you for coming.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.860]   Appreciate you giving me that much time.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.300]   And I'll see you next year.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.460]   [audience applauding]
