[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   I think that the deep pain point relates to sort of the envy of often husbands, fathers
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.600]   who have a setup that is more conducive to longer stretches of work time.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   What's ironic though, I think, is that part of why it's hard as a mom, and I'm saying
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000]   this with a lot of stereotypes in hand and I recognize that and I apologize, is that
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   part of what makes it hard to have those long stretches is the guilt that interrupts.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.500]   I'm Pal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 221.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.960]   If you're new to this program, it's where I answer questions from my audience about
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.440]   the struggle to work and live deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   If you want to submit your own questions, there's a link right in the show description.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.400]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.600]   I'm joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.680]   Jesse, I got a couple pieces of administrative work to do here, a couple announcements to
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.240]   make, but I wanted to talk first about what's coming up in the show because I'm kind of
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   excited about it.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   We have a guest.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240]   Nice.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.320]   And we're going to actually integrate a guest into a fuller episode.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.400]   We're trying something new here.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.520]   So we have a deep dive coming up.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.280]   After the deep dive, we have a guest, which I'll tell you about in a second.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320]   And then after the guest, there is a little bit more to do.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.680]   We are going to talk about the guest and one extra issue that I wanted to bring up.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.720]   So the guest we have today coming up a little bit later is Yael Schonbrunn from Brown University.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   Yael is an assistant professor of psychology and she has a new book out.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.320]   I'm holding it up to the camera for those who are watching called Work Parent Thrive.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.760]   It takes a psychological approach to the issues that arise from being a working parent.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   We hear about this a lot.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.940]   Jesse, would you say this is like one of the, I don't know, top five topics we hear is from
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.300]   people who are confused, emotional, frustrated, or looking for help on the struggle of having
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.880]   a career while also having kids.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.280]   It's definitely one of our top issues.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.960]   A hundred percent.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.060]   And Yael has a fantastic approach that's rooted in acceptance commitment therapy.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.120]   As we'll talk about in this interview, it's different than the existing approaches to
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.360]   this issue.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.340]   It doesn't supplant them, it complements them.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.800]   But as you'll see, it's incredibly aligned with the deep lifestyle, values-driven, lifestyle-centric,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   career planning style approach we take to the show.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   Now we have a bonafide PhD psychologist who actually knows the research, who's going to
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.040]   help you tackle these issues of being a parent and work in a way that we talk about, but
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   with much more professional gravitas.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.120]   So I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.560]   A couple of administrative announcements.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   We got the event coming up, the live event for those of you in the DC area.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.280]   Next week, it's Monday, November 14th at 7 p.m.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   I think I have that right, at East City Books in Washington, DC.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.600]   I will be moderating a conversation with David Sachs about his new book, The Return of Analog,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   or The Future is Analog.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   Do I have that wrong, Jesse?
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Let me see.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.000]   Let me look it up here.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   The Future is Analog.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I said that wrong.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.100]   His first book was The Revenge of Analog.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.920]   His new book is The Future is Analog.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   There we go.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.240]   David is really pleased with this promo right now.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.280]   David somebody has a book that's called Analog Something.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.240]   I don't know.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.840]   Sometime in November, I'm going to talk about it somewhere, so whatever.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.680]   David Sachs' new book is The Future is Analog.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.320]   He is doing a bookstore appearance on November 14th at 7, in which I will be moderating a
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   conversation with him.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   Jesse is going to come, too.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.440]   We're going to kind of treat it like a live episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.920]   I'd love to see you.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.200]   The other administrative thing I want to point out is we've been doing interesting things
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.840]   with the YouTube page.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.520]   So youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.280]   In addition to full episodes being on there and clips from the episodes, we've done now
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   four weekly update videos where I talk about some of my personal struggles as a professional
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.720]   writer, professor, and podcaster to do deep work and balance that amidst all the demands
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   of the shallow.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   So you get a sort of inside look into my life and my work, which I don't always get in that
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.760]   much detail on the show.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   I don't always get in that much detail about myself in my articles.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.440]   So if you're interested in my struggles and my strategies and how I try to make my life
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   work, you should check out those videos over at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.160]   Discussion of the interview and one extra point that I wanted to bring up.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.680]   So I think it's a good game plan.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.600]   Let's get started now with the deep dive.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.560]   The topic of today's deep dive is the 20% paradox.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.800]   Now I wanted to choose a topic that was going to be relevant to the interview that follows
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   in this episode.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.080]   So stick around for the interview that follows because you're going to see some deep connections
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.920]   between what my guest has to say in this topic I wanted to tackle here up front in the show.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.600]   So what is the 20% paradox?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.400]   It is the observation that if you take a knowledge worker who is burnt out or stressed about
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.100]   their work, which let's be honest is a large percentage of knowledge workers right now,
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.660]   and you measure how much work are they doing above the threshold of sustainability.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.440]   So the level where if your work is below this volume, it's pretty sustainable.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.540]   You're not super stressed about it.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.080]   Your job is just what it is.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.940]   How much work are they doing above that threshold?
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:15.400]   What you find consistently is that it's going to be somewhere around 20% too much work.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   Not 60%, not 200%, not 100%, but it's always right around 20%.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   Now there are people who do, let's say 100% too much work.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.920]   So if we just for the sake of round numbers, say nine to five, five days a week, if your
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.440]   work fits comfortably in there, that's pretty sustainable.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   We're used to that.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   We'll be okay with it.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   It's possible.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.320]   Some people work a hundred hour weeks and they need all a hundred hours to get things
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   done.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.520]   I know some people like that.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.560]   That's very rare, right?
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.720]   Most people, it's about 20%.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   It's like me today.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.400]   I'm a little stressed out today because I have probably one hour too much stuff on my
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   schedule.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.040]   If there was one hour worth of work removed, like an appointment removed from today, from
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.280]   my schedule, then we would be okay.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.720]   I'd have time to get everything done.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.520]   I'd have some margin.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.880]   The day would end at the normal time and I'd be okay.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.120]   I don't have quite enough time after I record today's episode.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   I'm running out the door.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   20% too much.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:21.300]   And this is what you find more or less when you study stressed out knowledge workers.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.480]   So why do we fall?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:30.720]   Why is the source of stress always coming from this relatively narrow quantity of overwork?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.200]   The wrong answer, the answer we tell ourselves when we interrogate our burnout is that I'm
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.720]   being asked to do the amount of work I'm being asked to do is about 20% too much.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.560]   I just look, I can't just say no to my boss.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   This is what's on my plate.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.480]   And what's on my plate is about 20% too much.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's I'm being asked to do too much.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.520]   The reality is though, in almost every case, you're saying no to most things that you're
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.320]   asked to do.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.800]   Most people don't realize this, but you're turning things down implicitly or explicitly
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.760]   through direct conversation or indirect action all the time.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.080]   And this kind of makes sense, right?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.640]   Like what, what are the chances that of all the different people in your life, in your
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   professional life who could make requests of you, who can put work on your plate?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.720]   What are the chances that it just works out that all of the different requests that they
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.320]   throw your direction in an ad hoc manner with just slaps, checks and grabbing you at a meeting
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   or emails?
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.800]   What's the chances that when you add up all that work, it ends up to be exactly about
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.080]   20% too many hours.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   That's not going to happen.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.880]   That would be a cosmic coincidence.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.400]   That's rolling 17 dice and having them all come up threes.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.880]   What's really happening is that you're getting asked to do things all the time.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.440]   If you really added up the work of all the things you could be doing and all the things
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.240]   you could be accepting, it would be more hours than there are in the week.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   It would be impossible.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.640]   You're saying no to most things.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.680]   The things you say yes to ends up being about 20% too much.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.440]   The reason why I think this happens, and I've talked about this before on the show, but
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.320]   let's make it really clear here, is not about the logistics of work.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.020]   It's not about administrative philosophies.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.040]   It's not about time management strategies.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.200]   It's about psychology.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.440]   It is difficult for humans to say no to other humans that are making a request of them.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.480]   This would make complete sense if we want to put on our somewhat suspect pop evolutionary
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   psychology hat.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   This makes sense.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.000]   I want to avoid just those stories here, but this makes sense because we're a tribal species.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.800]   We're used to living in a small tribe of people who are related to us that we're fiercely
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.840]   loyal to.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.880]   In the tribal context that dominated for the first 300,000 years of our species existence,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.440]   requests were probably pretty serious and there would be a real social consequence to
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   saying no.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.040]   When your tribe member says, "I need you to watch my back as I attack this mammoth," if
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.720]   you say no, that's a problem.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.080]   You're going to get a rock to the back of the head.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.120]   As you can tell, I know a lot of really good details about Paleolithic life.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.840]   All right, so we take requests from people we know in our tribe seriously, so it's very
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   difficult to say no.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.240]   Okay, this is a mismatch, of course, for a world of 700 other employees in your organization
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.400]   and human resources and other types of groups within your company that all need different
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   things from you and who can make requests with basically no friction by sending you
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.680]   a quick email.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:38.200]   That brain, that Paleolithic brain is a mismatch here because here it's not life and death.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.840]   Someone asking you to come participate in a panel is something that it's not a big deal
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   if you say no to.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.080]   No one's going to get a rock to the back of their head.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.240]   No one's going to get gored by a mammoth, but our brain is concerned.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   So we have a hard time saying no.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.620]   It's a psychological problem.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.840]   What helps if we feel overloaded and stressed?
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:05.640]   This gives you, from an internal psychological perspective, coverage to say no.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.720]   Not coverage to the other person, coverage to yourself, your brain, your Paleolithic
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   brain.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   "We can't say no.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   We can't say no."
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   You're like, "I am so stressed."
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.160]   You're like, "I mean, we got to say no.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   We're overloaded.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.760]   I mean, look, this is an extreme circumstance.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.680]   I normally would say yes, but there's these other factors like our cortisol is up, our
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.320]   schedule's packed.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.560]   With reluctance, we have to say no."
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.680]   I really do think this is a big source of the 20% rule is that we implicitly engineer
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.000]   the volume of our acceptances to get us a workload that's just heavy enough that we're
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.840]   in a persistent state of low-grade stress.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.640]   And then that is where we then feel comfortable saying no to what follows.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.600]   The reason why we don't curve our workload 20% less below the sustainability threshold
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.120]   is because when our work is sustainable, we don't have the psychological cover to say
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   no.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:03.040]   It's a self-reinforcing feedback network that has a convergent steady state at the stressful
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.680]   side of that threshold.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.280]   So I think this is really important.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   The other person doesn't care as much as you think when you're politely saying no, because
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.720]   you've already said no to them probably seven times for other things.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   You just didn't realize it.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   They don't care.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.280]   They don't know the difference.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.920]   Your CV, your resume, your bosses, you think they really would know the difference between
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.840]   if you spent 20% less time.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.240]   That's not going to show up.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.680]   There's so much noise and how many things get accomplished or this thing took this much
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   more time than this thing.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.880]   It's all a little bit apples to oranges.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.820]   20% less work doesn't necessarily even show up in a way that anyone is ever going to notice.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.700]   The outside world can't see things at that granularity, but it can make all the difference
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.860]   to your personal sustainability, your personal satisfaction.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.100]   It's a small epsilon that if you close it, lots of good things happen, but it's psychologically
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.500]   difficult to do.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.540]   So partially this is just expository.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.540]   It's a theory.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.660]   We're all stressed, but not like completely 100-hour week overloaded because it's a coping
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.340]   mechanism.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.020]   Partially this is also advisory.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.420]   If we understand the 20% paradox, maybe we will be a little bit more emboldened to just
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.500]   shave that extra epsilon of work off and fall back to a more sustainable place.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:25.020]   When we understand that we actually say no implicitly all the time, we do not have 60
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.700]   hours of work exactly being put on our plate.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.100]   We have 200 hours being put on our plate and we say no to most of it.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.780]   Then saying no a couple more times is not so fraught, but it's going to make all the
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.780]   difference in the world.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.420]   It's going to be one less meeting today, ending your day and moving to a shutdown ritual
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.820]   one hour earlier than normal, starting your day one hour later, one more project off your
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.260]   plate, one more year in between book projects.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.260]   I don't know.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.060]   Whatever adds up to 20% in your particular professional world, it can make all the difference.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.940]   So anyways, keep the 20% paradox in mind.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.940]   It's a big driver of stress.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.300]   It's largely psychological.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.580]   Psychological problems have internal solutions.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.140]   So we have some hope here that we can make a difference.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.700]   All right.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.180]   Now coming up next is our interview with Yael Schonbrunn.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.460]   Before we get there, let me first briefly mention a sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.900]   And that is our friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.460]   Hinson is the razor that I use.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.460]   So here's the idea.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.060]   If you haven't heard me talk about this before, it's a family owned company whose specialty
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.180]   had been in aerospace parts manufacturing.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:44.100]   So they manufactured precision parts for the aerospace industry, including the International
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.540]   Space Station and the Mars Rover.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:56.780]   They put this technology to use to build this beautiful razor built on precision manufacturing.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.220]   So the Hinson razor is made out of aluminum.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.300]   It's very sturdy.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:09.780]   You put a single standard disposable safety razor, costs a dime, into this aluminum razor.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.260]   You tighten it and it is built so precisely that the metal razor blade extends just, and
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:22.060]   I'm looking up the number here, .0013 inches beyond the edge.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.900]   That's less than the thickness of a human hair.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.740]   So you have a very secure and stable blade with just enough blade exposed to actually
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.260]   do the shaving, but not so much blade exposed that you get the diving board effect, the
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.860]   vibration or bending of the blade that can cause the nicks, that can cause the discomfort
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.300]   and the irritation.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.660]   It's also built to be a clog free design.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.060]   There's channels carved right into it that evacuate the hair and the shaving cream to
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.500]   prevent clogging.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.780]   And so what you end up with is this beautiful thing.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.780]   There's very cheap standard blades in it, but because it's so precisely made, you get
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.940]   a fantastic shave.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:07.780]   And what that gives you, in addition to owning a cool object and getting a really good shave,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.300]   is affordability.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.740]   Because once you pay the upfront cost for this beautiful tool, all it needs to work
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.260]   are these 10 cent standard safety razor blades.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.020]   I mean, you can get a two year supply for like 20 bucks or something like this.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   So you end up actually spending a lot less money than if you instead are going to the
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:32.860]   pharmacy and buying the three packs of the plastic disposable razors every month or something
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.860]   like this.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.900]   So I use the Hinson's razor.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.420]   I like really good tools.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.720]   This is a really good tool.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.180]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.220]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll get two
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.980]   years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.180]   Just make sure to add them to your cart.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:06.100]   That's 100 free blades when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal and use the code CAL.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.640]   I also want to talk about Amazon Pharmacy.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.140]   When I need to go to the drugstore here in Tacoma Park, I always seem to wait until the
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   last minute.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.340]   I hope they will be open.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   But you know what?
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.420]   Sometimes if they are, that's even worse because we have the really long line of everyone who
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.580]   just got out of work and there's not enough pharmacists working there because there's
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:31.700]   a shortage of pharmacists and you're standing there for 20-30 minutes just to find out,
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.860]   oh yeah, they're out of stock for the drug you're trying to get.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.540]   This is why I love Amazon Pharmacy.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.140]   Yes, it's the Amazon that you know and already use for everything else.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.180]   Amazon Pharmacy delivers a better pharmacy experience that delivers directly to your
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.780]   door and works with most insurance plans.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.340]   So you can save time, money, and stay healthy.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.940]   You get the transparent pricing that you're used to from Amazon.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.820]   This is exactly how much this is going to cost before you order it.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.760]   Not like when you go to the pharmacy and say, I don't know, I hope this isn't that much.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.100]   You don't know until they actually ring it up.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.220]   If you're a Prime member, you can save up to 80% on your prescriptions.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.020]   And again, Amazon Pharmacy works with most insurance plans.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.700]   They also have real pharmacists available if you have questions.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.940]   You don't lose that ability to ask questions about your medication, but you don't have
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.180]   to wait at the door.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.300]   You order it just like you would order your seventh or eighth copies of my books because
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.600]   I assume you guys are doing that all the time.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.820]   Just add on to that same way you did ordering.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.920]   You can now order your medication to come straight to your door.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.360]   So Amazon Pharmacy is a pharmacy that works for your life with meds delivered to your
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   door.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.620]   It doesn't get any better than that.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.360]   Switch to Amazon Pharmacy and save time, save money, and stay healthy.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.780]   Learn more at amazon.com/deep.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.400]   That's amazon.com/deep.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.840]   Amazon.com/deep.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.560]   Average savings based on usage and inside Rx data as compared to cash prices.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   Average savings for all generics are 78%, 37% for select brand medications.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   Restrictions apply.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.980]   All right, those are our sponsors.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.040]   Let's now get into our conversation with Yael Schonbrunn.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.840]   Yael, thank you for joining the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.080]   If I understand correctly, we have you on your book launch date.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.760]   So your new book, I'm holding it up here, Work, Parent, Thrive, that we'll be talking
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.520]   about came out on the day we're recording this.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.820]   So by the time you're hearing this podcast, it is widely available.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.200]   So as I mentioned before, I hope this is a nice distraction from the internet pulling
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.040]   at your attention every five or 10 minutes.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.960]   So we're appreciative to have you here.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.200]   Yeah, I'm so grateful to be here.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.120]   Thank you so much for having me on.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.300]   Appreciate it.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:01.680]   So our plan is I want to get into your book and the big approach and some of the nitty-gritty
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.340]   details later, time permitting.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.320]   We're going to get your expert opinion on some relevant issues we talk about a lot here
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   on the show.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.580]   But we should start off by just getting people up to speed with who you are.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.680]   So let me know what I'm missing here.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:26.140]   Assistant professor, psychology at Brown University, also mother of three children.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.620]   Okay, that's correct.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:36.460]   And your book, Work, Parent, Thrive, where did this come from?
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:41.140]   Well, it came from my own challenges as a working parent.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.900]   I think what most authors say is they write the book that they wished was available at
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.940]   some point in their life, and that was definitely the case for me.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.220]   Like many people, I struggled a lot when I first became a working parent.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:00.180]   And I really wanted something that was positive and where I could use the resources that I
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.260]   already had to guide me through what felt really challenging.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.100]   And most of what I found in the bookstore felt pretty negative, like talking about the
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:15.860]   structures of society that weren't adequate and policy and workplace and marital inequalities.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.380]   And while all of that may be true, I sort of wanted something where I could actually
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.780]   today start to create a better existence for myself.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.300]   And so instead of relying on the bookstore, I started diving into the academic literature
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.860]   as people like you and I do.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.540]   And I found some really cool concepts.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.500]   The first and most important one is this concept of work-family enrichment.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.980]   So we usually talk about work-family conflict, but there's this other side where there's
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   actually a lot of evidence.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.980]   And most people, if they think about it, can actually identify some of these kinds of experiences
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.980]   for themselves.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.620]   But work-family enrichment is this idea that our two roles help each other out.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.660]   And then once I had that in mind, I started diving deeper into science of creativity,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.980]   science of rest, stress research, relationship research.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.020]   And I found all of this different evidence that really our roles can help each other
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.020]   out.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.220]   And we're so focused on the conflict between them that we're really missing the ways that
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.180]   our roles work better together.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.460]   And so I decided to write a book about that.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.460]   And the result is what you're holding in your hands.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.820]   Well, I mean, it's one of the things I love about this book is I think your approach on
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.540]   this issue of working parenthood is something new.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.420]   And so maybe we'll step back and lay the foundation of what is new about this approach.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.900]   Let me tell you my theory about books about work and parenthood.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.420]   And then you can tell me if I have it right.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.580]   And then we can see if this makes sense for your book.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.020]   Because I get a lot of questions about this because we talk about work and productivity
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.020]   night.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.780]   So many questions, so much emotion, curiosity, frustration, anger on this topic.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.220]   It's a huge topic, especially with my audience, which is all sort of aging into parenthood
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   right now.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.940]   Let me know if this is right.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.740]   Before your book, it seemed like the spectrum of work parenting book was the, I call it
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.380]   the Laura Vanderkam, Bridget Schultz spectrum.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.820]   And you can tell me if I have this right or not.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.220]   But at Laura's side, it's like practical time management.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.740]   Like, okay, it's hard to be a working parent.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.060]   So like, here's some things that might help.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.820]   Bridget's side is more, we need to emphasize the essential impossibility of this task as
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.260]   a way to motivate more systemic reforms.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.500]   And there's kind of mutual suspicion.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.220]   Like if you give concrete time management advice, you might undermine the message that
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.340]   this is hard enough that requires systemic change.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.860]   And on the other way around, well, if all we're focusing on is emphasizing how impossible
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:41.540]   this is inventing, people could be less stressed if they would ever.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.220]   Your book seems to be, it's like triangulate.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.500]   It's a different, it's not on the spectrum.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.300]   It's doing its own thing because you're applying psychology.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.560]   So you described the book as taking an inside out approach.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.660]   So maybe we could get into that.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   So what is this approach?
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.020]   I think it's different than either of those two approaches.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.020]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:09.340]   And so I do want to emphasize, I think that the Bridget Schulte kind of mentality of the
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.900]   structures being inadequate and progress being necessary is absolutely right.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.660]   And Laura Vanderkam's idea about, that we can get more out of our time if we're deliberate
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.780]   about it and strategic about it.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.500]   That's all absolutely correct.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.020]   But I think what it does miss, and this is kind of what you're pointing to, that my book
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.500]   tries to do is this psychological piece that there's this huge element of working parenthood
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.780]   and why it's hard.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.620]   That is just fundamentally human.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.100]   Like as humans, we're drawn to different roles.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.580]   We want to love deeply.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.740]   We want to contribute meaningfully.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.540]   And that is a part of what makes for a human, like a fulfilling human life.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.140]   But inherent in that is if you're drawn to multiple roles that demand a lot of you, there's
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.740]   going to be conflict and it can't be fixed in the way that we might fix a machine, in
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.860]   the way that we might fix something in our house, because it's a human problem.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.100]   And so what is so, I mean, if you think about it, it's almost surprising that it's missing
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.420]   because it's such a human problem.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.020]   And yet there's nothing in the literature before my book that really addresses the psychology
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:15.100]   of this, of how we are drawn to lots of different roles and that actually being drawn to lots
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.580]   of different roles and participating in them is good for us.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.460]   And yet it comes along with this tension that exists between demands.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.540]   And so what I talk about is that a lot of what's out there offers these outside-in approaches
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.940]   of we got to make changes to the structures around us, to our workplaces, to our marriages,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.660]   to social policy.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.460]   And that includes time management.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.220]   That's kind of like an outside approach, outside-in approach.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.900]   And what I talk about is drawing on research and practices from clinical psychology to
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.980]   change how we think about working parenthood and how we approach it sort of from more of
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.380]   a psychological perspective.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.240]   And so I do think it's a pretty different approach.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.260]   And what's interesting is, and you're sort of saying like there's tension between the
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.340]   Laura Vanderkam and the Bridget Schulte camps, is that I think there's going to be tension
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:08.800]   between my camp as well, because people are so invested in sort of defaulting to this
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.860]   narrative because it's been so dominant for so long.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.020]   And so I think it can be uncomfortable to think about this as a human problem because
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.860]   we so badly want this to be something that can be fixed.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.460]   And I argue that it can't, not at least in the traditional way that we think about fixing
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.460]   problems.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.820]   And I'll tell you why part of why this resonated is I saw this reflection too early in my own
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:35.660]   writing career where I was writing student advice books.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:41.500]   And my first books on student advice were very just purely tactical.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.740]   Let's talk about the strategies for how you study, how you manage your time.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.580]   And then once I actually started advising students, so over email and in person, I just
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.780]   met with real students, there was a shift in my work where I realized the human side
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.860]   was so fundamental that there was this big shift where the psychological reality of the
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:05.180]   role that school played in people's minds and ambition and burnout and the human side
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.800]   really opened a lot up.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.660]   And so I'm already predisposed towards adding the human side so important.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.340]   And I think that's why I like this.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.380]   So let's go back then to the, you mentioned before, and this is early in your book, we
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.060]   think now as working parents that we have a parent role and a work role and they're
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.580]   in conflict and we just wish they could both be optimal as if they're done in isolation.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.420]   And we see it as a problem when one pulls from the other.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.500]   You say psychology tells us something different.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   Multiple roles could be good.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   They can enrich each other.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.980]   So, so walk us through that because I think this is, this gave me some optimism.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.580]   I mean, it's pretty cool when you think about it.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.740]   So it's sort of, there's these two competing models and one is the scarcity model where
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.420]   like we have a finite amount of time and energy and attention.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.980]   And this is where work family conflict thinking comes where we think, you know, if we're working,
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.980]   then we're not parenting.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.340]   And so we're dropping the ball on parenting.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.460]   And if we're parenting, then we're really screwing our work life over.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.060]   And that there is some evidence to that, right?
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.420]   There is finite time and energy and you got to sleep for some of the hours of the day,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.900]   but there's this other theory called role accumulation.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.700]   And the idea there is that each role can kind of feed each other.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.140]   And I think about this in three distinct pathways.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.340]   So we can think about the skill transfer.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.580]   So we have multiple roles, but whenever we're in a given role, we're probably building a
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   skill.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.100]   So Cal, when you're on this podcast, you're thinking deeply, you're asking provocative
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.140]   questions, you're paying attention to technology.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.660]   So you're building skill.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.620]   And in some ways that feeds back to your parenting role.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.220]   You can ask your kids deep questions.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.100]   You can teach them about technology.
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.380]   When you're parenting, you're certainly building skills.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.540]   You're building skills and empathy and perspective taking and being incredibly patient.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.540]   And guess what?
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.180]   All of those skills tend to be really beneficial in the workspace.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.180]   So that's skill transfer.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.620]   Then there's the buffer effect.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:01.060]   And this is the idea that when we have a stressor in one area of our life, it can sort of be
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.340]   buffered by positive experiences that we might have in another.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.100]   So if you have a rough day at work, you get to go home and hug your kid.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.380]   If your kid is going through a super rough developmental stage, you can go to work and
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.740]   have a positive experience of mastery.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.060]   The final pathway is the additive effect.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:24.100]   And that's the idea that happiness in at least one definition that psychologists use is built
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.540]   on a meaningful life.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.960]   And the more roles we have, the more opportunities that we have to build meaning, to have a sense
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.420]   of purpose and contribution.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:39.140]   And so in that way, having lots of roles, although they might sort of take time that
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:45.060]   takes us away from the other role, can actually offer us opportunity to build more meaning,
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.300]   more purpose.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.940]   And so in these various pathways, there's opportunity for the roles to kind of help
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.100]   each other and help us sort of grow bigger.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.340]   So it's this kind of Taoist idea where you have the yin and the yang pressing against
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.340]   each other.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:03.300]   And if you sort of zoom out, the yin and the yang together are greater than the sum of
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.420]   their parts.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.540]   And that's the idea of work family enrichment.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.680]   So we're stepping away from the scarcity model and into this accumulation enrichment model.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.180]   And that's the mindset shift that I'm hoping to leave people with through the book.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.420]   I mean, I love that mindset.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.380]   It's like an implication of what you're saying, for example, is, you know, when you're the
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.100]   working parent and you're frustrated that I have something taking my time away from
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.340]   work, I have to leave early to pick up my kid, you tell yourself a story that if I had
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.620]   no kids and I only had this job, I'd be doing so much better.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.500]   Man, I'd really be killing at this job if I just had more time.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.420]   But the counterfactual might not be that.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   Well, you would have more time, but there's these skill transfers you're missing.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.340]   Also, would you really be happier?
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.200]   So OK, if you could add an extra two hours a day and maybe even there's like some promotions
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.660]   that happen faster if you had a more monolithic source of meaning in your life, that's very
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.660]   unstable.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.420]   I mean, this is an implication, I guess, right?
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.060]   Like the counterfactual, if I could just be a parent and do nothing else or if I could
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.540]   just have a job and do nothing else, it's not so clear that that would be a better parenting
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.700]   experience or that that would be a better professional experience.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.780]   Right.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.780]   And the other point I'll just kind of add on is that the mindset that we take impacts
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.780]   how we engage.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:25.860]   So if I think to myself, my work is so bad for my kids, then I'm going to be really sheepish
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.540]   and ashamed when I'm with my kids or when I tell them that I have to go and they're
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.020]   going to pick up on those cues.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.740]   And it's probably going to I'll actually back up a little bit.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.940]   There's this very interesting study on low wage earners and the early years of parenting.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.760]   And one analysis that the researchers did was comparing different cultural populations.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.900]   So they looked at beliefs about the impact of work among African-American moms and among
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.180]   Latina moms.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.540]   And this is just a statistical finding.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.740]   Obviously, this is not always true, but on average, African-American moms were more likely
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   to think that work was something to be proud of and that it was good for the family, whereas
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.940]   Latina moms were more likely to think that work their work was going to cause irreparable
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.780]   damage to their kids.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.020]   And what the research study found is that those differences in the beliefs about the
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.340]   impact of work on their kids were associated with depression symptoms over the first year
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.100]   of their child's life.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.880]   And those depression symptoms were associated with how the parents interacted with the kids.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.460]   And so you have parents working and this is sort of controlling for supervisor support
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.700]   and number of hours and various other things.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.300]   The mindset that we have about work really changes the way that we participate in our
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:40.500]   work and also the way that we participate in opportunities to engage with our kids.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.060]   And so it's even more than just sort of like on the face of it, what you're doing, it's
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.460]   like the how you're doing it.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:52.300]   And the mindset can really contribute in ways that I think are beyond what we fully understand.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.500]   Interesting.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.620]   And then how does labeling play into that?
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:01.100]   Something else you talk about is distancing from unhelpful labels.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:07.060]   Is labels the cognitive, whatever, signifier of an underlying mindset?
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.540]   What do you mean by that advice?
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:14.500]   Yeah, so labels are kind of like the specific words that your mind spits out that are sort
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.380]   of based in mindsets.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.860]   Mindsets are sort of like this filter and the labels come out of the filter.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:25.980]   So if you sort of walk around the world thinking, you know, work is so bad for my kids, then
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.100]   you're probably going to spit out the words like bad working parent, neglecting parent,
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.280]   or you know, failure in some way.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.820]   And so it's sort of like the broad filter generates, helps you to generate the specific
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.820]   words.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:45.560]   And what we understand about the way that people connect to words is that, you know,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.680]   if you're connected to I'm a bad working parent, it's more likely to again, contribute to how
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.000]   you feel and also how you engage in the world.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.640]   So they're all connected, but they're sort of, you know, at different levels of processing.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:04.880]   What about like self descriptions as busy, I'm overloaded, I'm stressed out, the knee
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.320]   jerk, how are things going?
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.440]   Oh, it's completely crazy.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.520]   It's completely busy.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.360]   Does that fall into that same category of labels?
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.680]   Yeah, it does.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.720]   And I think the important thing is to recognize that like the human brain labels, that's just
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.160]   something the human brain does.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.320]   You know, we categorize, we have to understand a very complex world that has input coming
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.760]   in from internally and from externally in such high abundance that it's hard to process
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   it unless we sort of categorize things.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.120]   And labeling is one of the ways that we categorize.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.160]   And labels, therefore, aren't bad.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   They're not good or bad.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.040]   They just, it's just what our brain does.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.960]   The thing that I try to call attention to, and this is based in the kind of therapy that
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.280]   I practice, which is an evidence-based therapy called acceptance and commitment therapy,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.720]   is that there are times when connecting to certain words or certain stories can really
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.800]   drive unhelpful behavior that is sort of the antithesis of how you want to show up in whatever
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.480]   the role is.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.280]   So if, you know, there's really interesting studies that, you know, stereotype threat,
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:11.320]   like if a woman is taking a math test and they've been exposed to some words like, you
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   know, women are bad at math, your mind getting consumed with that really interferes with
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.400]   your performance.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.800]   And so in that way, the labels that we connect to can be really problematic.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.480]   But then there are some labels that are quite helpful.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.880]   Like if before I get on a podcast, I'm feeling kind of nervous and I connect to a label of,
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.720]   you know, I'm articulate, like that might actually help me perform better.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.000]   So the labels themselves aren't good or bad.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.920]   It's more just figuring out what labels are helping us to live in accordance with how
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.840]   we most want to live and which ones are interfering.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.960]   And when we notice labels that are interfering, and often it's those negative, rigid, really
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.040]   extreme black and white kind of labels, that's when it's useful to notice them, unhook from
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.600]   them and connect with labels that are more value aligned.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.200]   So like, what are some examples of common negative labels that working parents get stuck
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.840]   on?
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:18.520]   I think any, you know, failure, falling short, overwhelmed, unfair, those kinds of labels
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.360]   can be really problematic for performing.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:28.600]   I'm trying to think of other ones that are common, but those are the ones that pop to
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   mind.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.400]   And we've talked about, because I'm a fan of acceptance commitment therapy, we've talked
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.000]   about on the show some, and Stephen Hayes' book was inspirational to me.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.440]   So we've talked some about on the show, I'm assuming some of the same strategies that
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:46.480]   come out of ACT, like the labeling the label as a way to distance, like, "Oh, all right,
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.440]   mind, there goes the, you know, I am a terrible parent.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   I'm never around.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.720]   All the other parents are better than me story.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.120]   All right, I know that story.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   Thanks mind.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   I'll get back to that later."
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   Is that same strategy?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.840]   Yeah, there's a number of those, but that's the simplest one is I'm having the thought
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.080]   that you thank your mind.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.280]   I mean, often this is kind of what you're pointing to, your mind needs to be thanked
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.920]   because it's trying to do you a favor.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.200]   And that is actually one of the functions of labels is like, if you've identified that
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.840]   parenting well is important to you, which probably is, then your mind is trying to prompt
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   you to do better.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.360]   So calling you out as not doing well is an effort to sort of get you to put in a little
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   bit more energy.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.000]   The problem is that it sometimes doesn't work very well because when we feel ashamed of
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.040]   ourselves that actually isn't when we do our best work in any role.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.260]   And so thanking your mind for caring enough about the role and then connecting to a different
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.440]   kind of strategy.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.880]   So unhooking is called diffusion and acceptance and commitment therapy is one strategy.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.000]   You can also do different imagery techniques of like seeing the words on a screen or you
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.080]   can write them down and fold it up and sort of put it to the side.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.440]   Or you can do this very cool strategy called that is this practice called milk, milk, milk,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.040]   where you repeat the word over and over again until you kind of realize that words are just
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.640]   kind of sounds and it helps you to kind of unhook from the meaning that we attach to
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   it.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.440]   So there's all these very cool strategies in the act that are really fun to use and
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.440]   very helpful.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:19.040]   So I want to get to what I think one of the core issues is on this topic with my admittedly
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.360]   narrow audience, but this is just the the core sub issue that I would say underlies
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.520]   a lot of the correspondence I get from people, which is ambition.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:36.600]   Right, because there is this fundamental reality and I'm struggling with this.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.040]   A lot of my audience is struggling with this.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.320]   If you're a high achieving, ambitious person, there's no way to avoid if you have a family,
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:51.600]   you will it will reduce the number of things you can accomplish per whatever unit time.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.160]   I mean, so we can talk academia since we're both professors.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.080]   I mean, for sure, I would publish more papers if I if I didn't have kids like just in most
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.680]   fields, if you're very ambitious, you have something like that.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.520]   A lot of what I'm hearing from people in their 30s who are just starting families is coming
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.520]   to grips.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.000]   Well, how do you deal with this reality?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.480]   I'm an ambitious person, high achieving person in my professional life that is being curtailed
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.280]   some.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.400]   So how do we address that specific subfield with the type of ideas we've been talking
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   about so far?
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.480]   Well, so I have to share that my first entry into popular press writing was a 2014 New
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.640]   York Times piece that I wrote and the title was A Mother's Ambition.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.520]   And it was all about my own struggle with becoming a parent and sort of drawing back
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.200]   on my ambitious academic pursuits to be more the kind of parent that I wanted.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:50.360]   And it was and is a challenge because ambition is it's it's like a personality trait.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.480]   It's pretty static and that's definitely a trait that I hold.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.160]   And yet, I mean, I have just written a book.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.360]   So on some level, I am ambitious, but on many other levels, I've really drawn back because
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.020]   of the parenting role that I've adopted and the way that I do it.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:10.120]   And I think the answer that I have to what do we do with ambition if we've decided to
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.640]   participate in lots of roles is clarify your values.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:19.320]   So this is a practice that's really central in ACT, which is to identify what how you
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.800]   most want to show up in the world in whatever role, in whatever context you're sort of looking
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.880]   at.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   So values are different than goals.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.920]   So if you think about the metaphor of climbing a mountain, a goal would be the destination
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.960]   of getting to the top of the mountain, whereas values describe the quality of action, how
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.320]   you're taking the journey.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.040]   So you could do it ambitiously, right?
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.440]   You could like try to get a really good workout and get to the top of the mountain as quick
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.720]   as you can and beat all your friends.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   Or you could take it slowly and enjoy the sights and the sounds.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.320]   And you might decide to bring your kids along and then you're going to go really slowly,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.280]   but it might be really fun.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.320]   And then if the weather changes, you've got to shift your value and prioritize safety
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.280]   if there's a storm over getting to the top of the mountain.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.120]   So values shift based on context.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.760]   And you may still want to get to the top of the mountain, but decide to take the journey
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.840]   differently based on what's going on around you and inside of you.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.200]   And I think being able to do that values clarification work can be really helpful.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.560]   And again, that doesn't mean it's not uncomfortable to sort of draw back on ambitious pursuits
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.760]   in the service of participating in more roles.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.400]   But it does help you transcend that discomfort because you're clearer on what you want to
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   stand for.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.080]   So for me, I have really slowed down my academic trajectory.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.840]   I've been lapped many times over by colleagues who started at the same time as me and who
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   I thought I'd be moving along with.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.160]   But because I've been really clear on what's important to me and what kind of a meaningful
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:53.960]   life I want to be living, I have been able to tolerate it.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.440]   But it doesn't mean that it's been easy.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.600]   There's been lots of moments that are and continue to be pretty uncomfortable for me.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.920]   Well, this has basically become a personal therapy session for me.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.800]   So I do appreciate this.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.000]   I mean, I just got back from I don't know if you have the same experience, but when
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.240]   you go to academic conferences, the interactions with the people who have just sprinted beyond
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.480]   you, who you were together with, like you went to grad school together, and it's always
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.240]   a good shaking.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.480]   So then what about, OK, this is great.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.440]   The two elements you mentioned that I want to highlight here that makes this hard is
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.320]   the peer comparison and then unfairness.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   So there's all these like systematic unfairness in all of this.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:44.440]   So no kids versus kids, you have a leg up in a lot of things.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.600]   Men versus woman, dad versus mom, the mom almost always is going to have the bigger
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.440]   hit than even their partner or the dads that you know.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.360]   So there's all these different field versus other fields.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:03.640]   Some fields are more flexible and can deal with parenthood and other fields.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.000]   It's no, it's unrelenting.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.080]   Professors have it easy compared to law partners.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   You say, well, wait a second.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.960]   You can like just go home if you need to.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   And there's not someone who's clocking your hours.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.680]   So how do we psychologically deal with peer comparison and unfairness?
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.840]   So I mean, what I think peer comparison does is it triggers envy, jealousy, and I'm a psychologist,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.320]   so I always think about the function of emotions.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.760]   How are emotions serving us?
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.440]   Most emotions are wired in for self-protective purposes in some form or another, survival,
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.640]   reproduction, belonging to the group, protecting our kin.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   Jealousy I think is one of these emotions that is less about survival and more about
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.440]   highlighting what's really important to us.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.920]   So I think it's one of those really useful emotions because it tells you like, I really,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.220]   this thing is really important to me.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:00.560]   And so when you engage in a peer comparison, you see somebody lapping you or sprinting
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   past you.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.120]   I think it's a moment to pause and say, you know, I'm not doing that.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.880]   Do I want to be doing that?
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.800]   Like is that a choice that I would make even if it means giving up on these other things
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.320]   that are the reason that I'm being lapped?
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:21.800]   So for me, and maybe for you too, it's really identifying, like I decided not to be hardcore
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.780]   in academia so that I could pursue popular press writing and so that I could be a more
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.120]   engaged parent.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:35.700]   Would I choose to go back in full throttle so that I could stay in line with my peers?
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.440]   And that helps me to clarify my values.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.160]   Like what do I really want?
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   Right?
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.420]   Because it's easy to sort of get caught up in the jealousy and instead to kind of unhook
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.960]   from it and get curious about it and use that as an opportunity to reconnect to what really
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   matters to you.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.680]   And if you decide, you know, I'd give it all up for that, you know, a CV that looks like
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.480]   my colleague who's so impressive, then that's really good information.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.460]   I imagine that for most people, like you gave up whatever you gave up for a reason and reconnecting
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.600]   to that reason can be really helpful in transcending the discomfort of that envy.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   And is it similar for unfairness?
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:18.580]   So, you know, COVID lockdown and you're watching colleagues without kids doing better than
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.860]   normal because like, great, I can just focus on my work while those with kids, the term
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.160]   we kept using on the podcast is this is a dumpster fire and I don't think people are
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.700]   recognizing like how impossible it is.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.420]   And everyone's just pretending like, well, we're on Zoom.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   It's okay.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.420]   It's not okay.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.660]   We have three kids in the house and it's chaos and it's terrible.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.660]   Is that a similar thing?
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.100]   So how do you deal with that type of fairness?
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.080]   Like, man, it's not jealousy, but it's frustration.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.600]   I think unfairness is sort of a really important emotion, right?
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.480]   This feeling of injustice because it points to the fact that there's a wrong that needs
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:00.080]   to be righted or action that needs to be taken to make things better.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.680]   And I can very much relate to what happened during the pandemic and being home.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:10.640]   And I actually, my husband has a very static schedule and he needed to be on calls from
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   nine to five.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.800]   So I would parent and then I was under contract to write this book.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.240]   So starting at like five o'clock after I had just done a day of homeschooling and parenting
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.480]   and making the meals and not having any reprieve, that's when I would start my writing.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.680]   It was really painful.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.040]   And I would get really angry with my husband.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.500]   How unfair is it that you can read an email and talk to adults and I have to sort of be
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.520]   at the service of three small little beasts who I love, but also I need a break from.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:41.400]   And it actually, like for many people, it helped me to say, you know what, this isn't
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   working.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.000]   We need to renegotiate some of the responsibilities within our constraints, right?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.220]   Like we need his job.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.600]   We need my job.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   We love our kids.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.720]   We're not going to toss them out.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:57.400]   But within what is possible, we needed to renegotiate how we did things in our home.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.840]   Sometimes that's not possible, right?
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.660]   Because there's these social policies and workplace rules and some marriages aren't
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.140]   as lovely as mine.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.020]   I'm totally unprivileged.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:12.740]   But I do think that injustice points to some action needs to be taken or we need to find
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.780]   a different way to handle what is.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.300]   And that's where some of the tools, again, from psychology can be really helpful.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:25.900]   Like if you can't make changes, can you change how you tolerate what is unjust, right?
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.680]   Can you sort of use it as a learning experience for you or sort of like make meaning out of
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   your suffering?
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.700]   This idea from Viktor Frankl's wonderful book, Man's Search for Meaning.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.480]   So there are different ways to tolerate it, even if you can't make changes.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:44.320]   But often that sense of injustice or anger is a prompt to try to pursue some change.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   Right.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   That makes sense.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.800]   There's a two-pronged approach there.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.720]   Let that point you towards changes you can make.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.580]   If it's within your own family, maybe it's we need to renegotiate these rules or renegotiate.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.840]   I've heard this a lot.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.520]   Renegotiate careers in the family, like this notion of is the default just going to be
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.700]   that you get to do your career without change and I'm going to sort of make some changes
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   and maybe we both should.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.820]   I know a lot of people who do.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.020]   Maybe we should both make some changes in our careers to make this more so there's the
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.660]   prompt for change or within a workplace.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.320]   Like the way we have this set up is that these guys over here get all these advantages that
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   aren't really serving the company.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   It's just arbitrary.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.280]   Can we change something about how we do this?
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:34.800]   And then for the unfairness that's never going to go away or what's residual, then we have
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.200]   working on how we react to it too.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.480]   And then it kind of overlaps some of what we're talking about with jealousy.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.640]   And there's also going to be some stuff that's just annoying and we can't change.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.580]   Don't let it consume because we have our values.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   We know what we're doing.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.580]   Exactly.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.580]   Exactly.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.580]   So let's make this concrete.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.220]   Let's say we have an assistant professor.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.580]   You know, like my scenario is probably similar to yours.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:02.020]   I started having kids after my first year as a professor.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.320]   So it was sort of like early on.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:11.040]   If we're putting all this advice into practice, like one thing you might say to that professor
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.060]   is figure out your values as a parent in academia.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:23.380]   Figure out a vision for your life and career that's very meaningful and is tractable and
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.680]   serves those roles and then pursue that.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.100]   And it might be like, I love being an academic.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.260]   I want to do important work on this topic.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.980]   I want to be a parent and I want to be around my kids during this age.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.140]   And there might be a very tractable way to do that, which maybe tenure comes a little
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.140]   later.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.740]   Maybe it's less awards as some of the hard charging peers.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.380]   But in the end, if I'm getting you correct, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.060]   You were doing really important academic work.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.060]   You could be a professor.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.060]   You could be a parent.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:54.100]   Like you could, you know, it's in the end, you're able to hit your values.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.300]   You have a lot of ways to get there.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.460]   And that's somehow separate from have I maximized some sort of utility function.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.540]   If I maximize the number of papers, am I the best?
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.660]   You know, in my group that these sort of superlatives don't really have a bigger, as big a role
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:14.380]   to play as a value driven vision that is tractable to pursue.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.260]   And I think, you know, in essence, what you're doing there is you're separating out the outcome
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.260]   from the process.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.660]   And that is what values work helps you to do too.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.180]   So we can have sort of outcome goals.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:28.900]   Like I hope to have X number of papers or to have achieved full professor by whatever
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.260]   age or to have my kids launched in a certain way.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.500]   Those are sort of like end goals that we want to get to.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.940]   And those are important to have because they kind of give us a direction to move in.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:44.500]   But even more important, I would argue, is the process is like how we get there.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:50.340]   So if what it takes to get to a CV, as long as, you know, you would ideally want, you
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:55.660]   know, this sort of maximized outcome requires you to never be around for your kids, you
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.940]   know, that is that a quality of action you want to embody over the next 10 years while
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.180]   your kids are still in the house.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:06.220]   And one way that I think is really useful to think about this is like thinking for this
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.300]   is like a perspective taking exercise.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.900]   So think forward to 30 years if you've gotten to somewhere in the realm of, you know, what
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.900]   your goals are.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:19.380]   You know, I'm a full professor and doing well and happy and my kids are doing well and very
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.380]   healthy.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:24.020]   How would I like to look back on this phase of life?
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.780]   What would I be most proud of having done in this stretch?
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.500]   What would I regret having done in this stretch?
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.680]   And you can think about it as it relates to the balance of working parenthood or the balance
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.340]   of whatever roles you participate in.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.940]   Because it helps to sort of unhook from like what sort of emotions are driving you to say
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.500]   like, oh, my God, but what if I pass this up by taking that future perspective of yourself?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:54.820]   Now, of course, you still want to get to that future perspective, that future position that
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.820]   feels desirable.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.940]   So you do have to consider opportunity costs, right?
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.260]   Like if you're doing one thing in a given moment, you're probably not doing the other.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.220]   Or if you're doing both, you're not doing either well.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.000]   So there are opportunities and costs to consider.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.920]   And again, this is where values come in handy because you can sort of decide, you know,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.400]   in what way do I want to participate in work so that I can also participate in parenting?
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   What would that look like?
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.340]   How would I describe the quality of action?
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.060]   So whenever I mentioned values on this show, which I usually do in an ACT context, people
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.140]   always ask, OK, but how do I articulate those?
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.060]   So what's the guidepost we have for if I'm sitting down, I'm a frustrated working parent,
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.100]   I want to start from scratch with your approach.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.300]   How do you approach values?
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.700]   Like what does that mean?
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.420]   You break it down by areas of your life.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.260]   Is it vision based?
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.260]   Walk us through that.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:50.220]   Yeah, so it is based on specific domains of life.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.060]   There's some exercises that I can share.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.500]   One is called the bullseye exercise.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.380]   If you do a Google search, you can find it.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.660]   One is called the eulogy exercise.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.180]   And they help you to sort of like narrow in, like, you know, on your work life or on your
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.380]   family life or on your leisure or on your spirituality.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:10.980]   And you sort of think about, you know, what are the qualities that you embody moment to
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.540]   moment?
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.020]   You can get even more specific.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:18.040]   So I do a lot of couples therapy and the values exercise that I have actually breaks relationships
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.420]   down into 10 different domains.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.940]   So like, how do you fight?
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.940]   How do you manage finance?
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.660]   How do you manage your intimate life?
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.220]   How do you manage co-parenting?
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.580]   How do you manage in-laws?
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.900]   Things like that.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.380]   And so in each of those more specific domains, you think about, you know, what are sort of
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.060]   like the high level ways that feel important to show up moment to moment.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.420]   So for example, when I we all fight with our partners, right?
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.700]   If a couple doesn't fight, they probably don't have a lot of intimacy.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.100]   The goal is not to avoid fighting.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.060]   The goal is to fight in ways that are value aligned.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:53.860]   So for example, respectfully or productively or with curiosity.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.620]   So it's sort of like quality of action.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.260]   Do you think about like adverbs that describe how you do something?
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.100]   But there also needs to be a lot of nuances.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.500]   You identify values because for example, you might say, you know, in my friendships, I
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   just want to be kind.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.740]   It's so important to be kind.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.660]   But what if a friend is taking advantage of you?
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.820]   So you kind of want to build in some qualifiers.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.220]   So you know, kind and when I'm in a relationship where somebody is being respectful of what
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.540]   matters to me.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.540]   And same thing goes, you know, for the most uncomfortable moments of life.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.220]   Those are the one, those are the areas.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:29.620]   So like when work and parenting conflicts, how do I value showing up?
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:37.380]   So my value might be, you know, to pause and get curious and to try to keep the ball rolling
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.680]   in both domains, even if it's going to be more slowly than if I only was participating
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.740]   in one domain.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:47.700]   So that's a lot of words to describe my value, but that's, that pretty much nails it for
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.260]   me.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:54.980]   So it doesn't have to be one word, but you sort of want to get at the gestalt of like,
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:00.220]   how do you most want to show up in this particular area that matters to you?
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:05.420]   And again, you know, values clarification is most important for the areas that are tricky,
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:09.620]   like the role tension that most of us experience.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.060]   You're speaking our language.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:15.580]   I'm smiling here because we talk about this on the show a lot, that this notion of the
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.500]   deep life and developing the deep life.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.980]   And it's very breaking things down into roles, establishing values for roles.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:27.180]   My listeners, you can now see that there is a commonality of acceptance, commitment therapy
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.660]   behind both of our thinking, because there's so much alignment with what you're saying
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.340]   and things I've been talking about.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.300]   You know, I have a couple out of left, not out of left field, but just sort of assorted
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:44.360]   issues that come up specific to this topic.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.980]   What do you think about this?
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:52.780]   There's an interesting tension maybe between shifting the nature of your work to something
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:56:00.220]   like part time versus just shifting the role that your job plays in your life.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:04.540]   And I have this pet theory I want to get your expert take on, that especially with ambitious
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:10.500]   people when they feel there's the conflict and they want to get rid of the conflict and
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.300]   reorganize their work and family life around values, that they want there to be a dramatic
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.020]   thing that happens.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.700]   So to get a dramatic improvement, I need something dramatic.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:25.900]   So I need to reconfigure my job, quit this job, do something else part time, become a
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.340]   freelancer, formally negotiate a much reduced hours.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.520]   Whereas in a lot of cases, probably the right thing, you could just internally reconfigure
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:40.700]   your engagement with that job in a way that is completely satisfactory with the employer.
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.500]   Maybe there's a psychological impact like, well, I'm in the same job, I'm not doing as
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.340]   well as my peers.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.340]   Have you thought about this at all?
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:52.500]   Or what's your thoughts on this tension between the dramatic transformation of your job versus
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:57.020]   transforming the role your existing job plays in your life when you're going through this
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.020]   type of thinking?
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.660]   It's an interesting question.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:05.540]   And what I think is actually interesting is I went through a pretty dramatic shift when
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:09.140]   I became a parent where I went pretty part time.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:14.020]   And one thing that I just want to point out is it did not eliminate the conflict, right?
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.260]   Because now I was an ambitious person who was working part time and that was deeply
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.260]   uncomfortable.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:23.780]   So I think one thing that you're pointing to is a lot of the time, these dramatic changes
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.300]   that we might pursue in order to eliminate the conflict doesn't actually eliminate the
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:32.360]   conflict because, again, that's an outside solution for an inside problem, mismatch.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.620]   When we apply an outside solution to an inside problem, we tend to make the initial problem
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.620]   worse.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:42.820]   And I think that's one of the main tenets of acceptance and commitment therapy is that
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.140]   that which we resist persists and grows stronger, at least from a psychological perspective.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:52.260]   So trying to solve internal problems with those kinds of solutions tends to make the
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.540]   problem worse, not better.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.340]   What this makes me think, by the way, is sometimes dramatic changes are actually the best thing
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:04.460]   to do, but you need to do the inside out work first.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.740]   And that, I would assume, would make it way clearer if there's some sort of big change
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.480]   that you want to make in your working situation.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.660]   You would be doing that from a foundation of great internal clarity if you've already
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:20.020]   clarified your values, changed your psychology, really understand work and other things in
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.020]   your life.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.800]   And if you've done all that work, I assume you can probably be much more accurate and
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.580]   strategic and effective in making changes.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.900]   Then you really realize, oh, yeah, I got to quit this job.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.220]   This is never going to work for me.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.220]   Or, oh, this job's fine.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.220]   I just need to change this.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:40.740]   But without the inside out work, sometimes it feels like from the listeners I hear from,
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:48.260]   they are, before they do that work, are just trying to shake up the Rubik's Cube or whatever.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.260]   That's not a good metaphor.
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.260]   But you know what I mean?
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.660]   I just want to do something dramatic because I feel like there's dramatic issues.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.060]   And that can go really awry if you're not coming from a foundation of, I know exactly
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.060]   why I'm doing this.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.260]   And sometimes, I mean, you're kind of pointing to this, but sometimes shaking things up can
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.820]   give you greater clarity.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:09.100]   And maybe part of the clarity is, I was trying to solve this thing that I'm unhappy with
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.100]   from the outside.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.660]   And actually, what I really need is to reset what I'm thinking and feeling and what my
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:21.000]   expectations might be so that whatever changes on the outside actually have the kind of impact
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   that I'm looking for.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.300]   Again, though, I just want to make clear, it isn't likely that we're going to get rid
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.760]   of the conflict, especially if you're an ambitious person, especially if you want to participate
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   in multiple roles.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:35.940]   So being clear that whatever change you make probably isn't going to undo that, but that
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.260]   your goal is to sort of create a life where you can have more satisfaction.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.220]   So there are outside-in changes that are going to be helpful.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:46.380]   And if you sort of in tandem do this inside-out work, it tends to be much more effective.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:51.420]   And from the example that I was sharing of my own history, I made this dramatic change
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.940]   to my professional life.
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.500]   I was still deeply unhappy because now I was home more with my kids who I adore, but also
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.860]   feeling so unsatisfied with how I was progressing in my work life.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.100]   And it required me to really think through how did I want to proceed in my work life.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.820]   And that was work that actually really was helpful.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:15.860]   I still am not as involved in academic work as I was when I first became a parent, but
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:21.380]   I feel good about it because I did the values clarification work and sort of am constantly
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.700]   reconnecting to what matters and how do I want to show up given that these are the choices
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.940]   that I've made.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:30.740]   So it's a little bit like you have to make the right choices and then you have to make
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.780]   the choices right for you.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.460]   I mean, that's sort of, we have to do both sides, right?
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:40.720]   Not every situation is going to work, but lots of situations can work if we make them
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   work for us.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   Oh, excellent.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.380]   So yeah, if you've made the choice with a clear value-based reason, there will still
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.380]   be hardship.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.540]   It's not going to eliminate hardship.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.620]   It's not going to eliminate tensions, but you'll be much better able to get through
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:59.260]   these hard moments and difficulties because you know why you did it.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.100]   So it's not about eliminating hardship.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.100]   Oh, everything's fine now.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.820]   And I'm just happy and feel really good.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.220]   It's about you're in a position where when these various hardships come, you are resilient.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.100]   You say, yeah, this is hard.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.020]   This has been a hard six months.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.920]   But I knew this when I signed up for this setup and I believe in why I did it.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.060]   And so I'll get through this or it's not going to be existentially destabilizing.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.060]   Exactly.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.900]   I mean, they've done randomized control trials of acceptance and commitment therapy for things
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.640]   like addiction.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.220]   And when you are clear on your values, it doesn't mean that you don't have an urge
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:38.620]   to use, but it means that you're better able to transcend that discomfort because you're
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:43.140]   connecting to a value of taking care of your health and getting clean and being a good
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:48.100]   partner to your partner and being a good parent to your children.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.700]   And again, it's still deeply uncomfortable, but by using your values as a guide rather
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:56.920]   than your emotions or even your thoughts, you're better able to stay the course and
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.640]   transcend those discomforts that you can't avoid.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.940]   So let me, I'm going to get your take on, you can be a proxy for my audience here, on
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:11.940]   a complaint I get a lot that I feel that I don't fully understand it, though I'm very
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:12.940]   empathetic to it.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:17.580]   And I'm going to ask you to sort of on behalf of half of my audience, maybe unpack what's
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.580]   going on here.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.020]   So I talked about this on the show, but I get this complaint a lot about the concept
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.700]   of deep work in particular.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.860]   And it's typically from working moms.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:34.340]   And it's typically either the form of the complaint is either, I can't, how can you
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.020]   do deep work if you're a parent?
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:44.980]   Or easy for you to say, but like deep work is only possible if you have a partner doing
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.560]   all the labor.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.180]   And there's a lot of like emotion behind these complaints.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:56.500]   And so at first, in my typical sort of guy, technical mindset, I was, well, logically
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.340]   speaking, I do not understand these complaints.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.140]   Deep work is just talking about the relevant, in the hours that you're normally working
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:08.220]   already, regardless of your situation, just allocating the email checks and minimizing
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.660]   context shifts and making optimal use of cognitive.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.300]   It says nothing about how much you should be working or whatever.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.300]   But I quickly learned, now there's something much more deeper and emotional and true going
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   on here.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.580]   So I'm going to put you, you can help me proxy for this.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:29.180]   Yeah, I mean, so maybe educate me a little bit on where's the pain point?
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:36.060]   Because I want to understand well, when there's a real sort of visceral pushback to the idea
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:44.500]   of deep work from the context of being a working parent, in particular, working mom.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:55.460]   I think that the deep pain point relates to sort of the envy of often husbands, fathers
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:02.300]   who have a setup that is more conducive to longer stretches of work time.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.220]   What's ironic though, I think is that part of why it's hard as a mom, and I'm saying
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.540]   this like with a lot of stereotypes in hand, and I recognize that and I apologize, is that
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:16.620]   part of what makes it hard to have those long stretches is the guilt that interrupts.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.180]   I could put my children in much more childcare and my husband would be fine with it, but
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.940]   I feel really uncomfortable about it.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:28.180]   And I certainly felt desperately uncomfortable about it when my children were infants.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.780]   And that wasn't something he struggled with.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.900]   Now, whether that's socially driven by the lessons that were taught as young women and
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:39.260]   young men as we age, or whether it's biological, I think is a really complicated question to
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.260]   answer.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.300]   I think there's evidence on both sides, but the fact of the matter is moms tend to feel
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.020]   more guilty about time away from their kids than dads do, just on average.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.060]   This isn't always the case.
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.780]   So I think that's one of the tricky points.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.140]   And so when you use the word deep work, people automatically think it's many hours, although
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.900]   you define it in a much more nuanced way that you can do deep work in shorter chunks of
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.020]   time.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:06.220]   And that's really what I advocate in my book is figuring out how to more mindfully drop
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:10.580]   into work, how to use some of the behavioral science that we know is really helpful for
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.100]   getting into the mode of deep work more quickly and efficiently.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:21.140]   And also recognizing that while task switching or role switching does cost us something in
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.740]   terms of the energy that it takes, that the more we do it, the more we practice doing
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.980]   that role switching, the more facile we get at it.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.180]   But also, it's a both and.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.060]   Also we don't want to do it too much because then we really do end up with what Bridget
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.140]   Schulte calls confetti time, time confetti, I think it's the term.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.700]   So it's complicated.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.380]   It is emotional.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.900]   And it can feel like an injustice.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.180]   Like why do I feel so guilty when you can sort of be free to go to work?
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.660]   And I think that is the part that I'll at least just speak for myself that I used to
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.500]   get very, very hung up on.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.500]   That's really useful, actually.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.980]   I mean, I really appreciate that.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.100]   I mean, just to echo it back, but I think I understand what you're saying is, no, it's
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.900]   not about the physical act of deep work, which is just, oh, I have an hour to work.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:13.860]   Like why don't I focus on one thing for the first 45 and then do the small things at the
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.220]   end instead of interleaving it?
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.180]   Yeah, anyone in whatever their situation is can change their ratio of deep to shallow
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180]   work.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.660]   But it's the reality, which I point out.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.660]   So fair enough.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:29.100]   Like I make this point in my book that the more deep work you can do tends to be correlative
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.340]   to career success.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.380]   So more deep work is better than less.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.180]   Men have an easier time doing more deep work than women for reasons that have nothing to
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.340]   do with the actual ability to do the work.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.940]   That is very frustrating.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:48.980]   I mean, if someone said, OK, here's the thing, people from most states get to work their
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:55.580]   jobs normally, but people from Maryland have to whatever, call in to the department or
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.580]   whatever, every hour or so.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.660]   And there's all these other things that they put on citizens of Maryland.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.100]   It's like taking up our time.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100]   I would be really frustrated.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.940]   Like, look at all these people in Virginia.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.940]   They're getting more done.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:06.940]   They're not as interrupted.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.020]   It's not fair just because I live in Maryland.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.020]   So I'm echoing that back.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.020]   Right.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.740]   And I could imagine that being, I can empathize.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.580]   I mean, I can kind of understand as best I can in my position.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.580]   That kind of sucks.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.580]   I think it does.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.340]   The other thing to think about is, you know, how, what do we reward in our society?
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:33.780]   And what we do reward tends to be, you know, accolades and more lines in your CV and more
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780]   money.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.380]   And one of the things, one of the gifts I think of working parenthood, and this is particularly
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:44.300]   true for mothers because they tend on average to be more involved in the parenting role
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:49.660]   is that we tend on average to be stronger in the relational department, in the empathy
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.620]   department, in the perspective taking department, in the patient's department.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.060]   And those skills are really useful at work.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:58.940]   They just tend not to be rewarded or acknowledged as being as important.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:02.900]   And so I think that is another piece that can get under people's skin.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.140]   And I think for very good reason.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.080]   And I don't really know what to do about that other than to recognize that they have inherent
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.780]   value, even if they aren't acknowledged with a promotion or a pay raise.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.660]   Although I think that they should be.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:19.260]   Concurrently to all of that, this inside out psychological approach of figure out your
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:26.740]   values in all of your roles, build a vision of your life that tractably satisfies these
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.860]   values.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:33.100]   Be very careful from an ACT perspective about unhealthy mindsets or destructive labels.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.820]   Look, you know, you find the enrichment between conflicting roles, not just what's negative
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.260]   about it.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:46.420]   And then be willing to ride out the ups and the downs, the oh my God, like me not publishing
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.740]   a paper during the pandemic year was very traumatic for me.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:53.060]   But being able to get through that because you're like, but I have this vision of my
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.740]   life and how academia fits in with my family.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.340]   And that that's actually a very sustainable approach.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.780]   I mean, to me, that's very optimistic because I think that's very useful.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.940]   I mean, there's a lot of people in my audience who that type of specifics that's in your
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:10.220]   book, I should say the name again, work, parent thrive for everyone who is listening.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.780]   That psychological approach is I think it's what people are missing.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.100]   It's and as you say, it's not replacing the Schulte approach.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.220]   It's not replacing the Vanderkam approach.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.820]   It's adding a third point in that triangle.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.500]   And we can we can abuse metaphors and say, yeah, we close in the shape now so that we
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   have a whatever, a region of solutions or something like that.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.700]   But that is very optimistic to me.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.020]   I think that's also very useful to me.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.980]   And I definitely got things out of this that's going to I'm going to use the the tune, my
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.980]   approach.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:41.980]   So, yeah.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:44.020]   Thank you for coming on the show.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.140]   I think you've done a lot of us a lot of good today.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.820]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.660]   It was so fun to chat with you.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.660]   What an honor.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   All right.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660]   So remember, work, parent thrive, everyone.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.420]   By the time you hear this interview, it's available everywhere.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.980]   Go get your copy today.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:57.980]   All right.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.620]   So there we go.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.300]   That was our interview with Dale Schoenbrum.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.940]   So Jesse, I enjoyed that video.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:11.140]   I want to interview, I should say, I want to talk with you about some observations I
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.940]   had, some takeaways.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:19.460]   I also have a news item I want to briefly review that a listener sent in and it seemed
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.460]   right up our alley.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.340]   So I want to go over that real quick.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.180]   But first, I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.580]   That is our friends at Policy Genius.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.300]   This is a true story.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.660]   Right before I came to the studio today, I had a meeting with our family's financial
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.020]   advisor.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:42.420]   One of the things he told me is that we need more life insurance.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.140]   On me, we have some, but we need more because life insurance is important.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.140]   Having enough is important.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:52.340]   So even if you have a little benefit through your employer, you probably need a lot more.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.940]   I could take that suggestion with complete calmness because I knew exactly how I'm going
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.020]   to get that insurance.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.140]   I knew exactly what the process is going to be.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.940]   I can just go to Policy Genius.

[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:04.060]   Speaking of living a long life and maybe not needing that life insurance for a little while,
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:08.660]   let's talk about our other sponsor, which is My Body Tutor.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:14.900]   This is a online coaching program started by my friend Adam Gilbert.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.800]   It solves the biggest problem in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:26.840]   They do this by assigning you a online coach who comes up with a plan for what to eat,
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:31.160]   what exercise to do that's fit to exactly your life, your constraints, your goals.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.480]   And then, and this is the magic of My Body Tutor, daily accountability.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.240]   They have an easy to use app, easy to use website.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.260]   You report what you did each day, what you ate, the exercise you did, any questions or
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.640]   concerns you have, and the coach responds to you every day.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   Good work.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   You need to work on this.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.160]   If you don't have an answer to your question, you can adjust as needed.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.400]   People have the information they need to eat healthier.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.000]   They have the information they need to be in better shape.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.640]   They lack the accountability that drives consistency.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.320]   An online coach through My Body Tutor will give this to you at an affordable price.

[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.840]   All right, so let's talk about this interview, Jesse.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   The thing I noticed, and I mentioned this in the intro to the interview too, but it's
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:43.320]   really in my head right now, was the similarities between Yael's advice for dealing with being
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.880]   a working parent and the way we talk about the deep life here.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.400]   It seemed really similar.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.840]   You break it down into areas, you get your values, you build a value-driven plan, you
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:02.040]   pursue that plan, you don't get caught up in comparisons or just arbitrary goals.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.880]   This is what I have a vision of my life that work fits in and my family fits in, and I'm
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.400]   going for that vision, and I'm going to stick to that vision.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   I'm not going to get too caught up in, "Well, I could have got a better promotion," or,
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   "I could have spent more time."
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.240]   It's that lifestyle-centric, that vision-driven approach to career, speaking our language.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.040]   Well, I think she did a pretty good job explaining a couple of things, especially when she was
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.520]   talking about the outcome versus the process.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.600]   You hear that a lot in sports.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.600]   I coach myself, and a lot of professional college sports talk about enjoying the process
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.160]   and stuff like that.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:45.240]   She was talking about that as well in terms of work and jobs and balancing all that stuff.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:51.280]   The other thing I thought was really interesting, she talked about revisiting, checking back
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.280]   in.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.240]   I think what you say, she was talking about dealing with the internal, like doing inside
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.240]   out work.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.360]   Then she was saying you need to check back in with the internal, and that goes directly
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.520]   in line with what you're talking about with your values document.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.760]   You check in with it all the time because you look at it in your time management process,
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.820]   which makes a lot of sense.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:19.520]   When you hear her talk about it that way, it suddenly makes it clear how volatile it
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.440]   would be to be going through life, especially in the situation of a working parent, where
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.400]   you weren't checking in.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.840]   You didn't have a value-driven vision of what you're trying to do.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:36.320]   If you were just bouncing from how you felt or events or crises day to day, that's got
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   to be exhausting.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.800]   You're like, "My God, here's another thing I didn't finish in time.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.460]   Here's another potential project I could have done that I couldn't take on.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.840]   This person's probably mad at me.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.080]   I didn't get the cupcakes to my kid's school.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.600]   I was late on getting this paperwork back."
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:59.000]   You just constantly be probably tearing yourself apart, which is the tone, I think, of a lot
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.440]   of reflective writing on working parenthood.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:08.160]   It's very much this sort of Bridget Schulte, like everything is so stressful.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   It's all impossible.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:16.180]   It gave me some optimism of if you have this value-driven plan, it's not going to seem
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.180]   impossible.
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.180]   It's not going to seem terrible.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.700]   On the other hand, and that's the way I push this, and I think she was frank about it,
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.400]   it's hard when you're ambitious.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.220]   You cannot do as much if you have kids.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.600]   That's really hard for people.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.460]   Even if you have a value, like I have a plan, it's a completely tractable plan.
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.020]   It respects multiple things I value.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.480]   It's a great plan for a deep life.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:44.740]   It's still kind of hard because that guy got a promotion, and I'm smarter than that guy.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:49.060]   >> DAVE Yeah, she did a pretty good job of explaining the emotions of jealousy and giving
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.740]   a good definition for that too.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.780]   >> DAVE Yeah, I think there's some great clarity.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:58.820]   I think the reason why my deep life discussions sound so similar to what she's saying about
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.460]   working life, the common thread is acceptance commitment therapy.
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:08.020]   I guess I didn't realize how influential reading Stephen Hayes' book, etc., how influential
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.640]   that had been on my thinking about the deep life until I heard her framework that's built
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   off that same thinking.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   I say, "Oh, that's very similar."
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:22.800]   So I'm having this revelation that, "Oh, I have a psychological approach in my work,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.480]   an implicit psychological approach.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.280]   We talk strategy, but we also talk a lot about the psychology, especially with the deep life
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280]   stuff."
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.560]   I'm not explicitly thinking about that as psychological, but it really is.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.380]   How you actually build an understanding of yourself and your life and what you're trying
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.340]   to do, she's much more rigorous about it.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.440]   But it's interesting to know there's that psychological underpinning.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:52.220]   I also thought it was interesting, her explanation for why people, when they write me and are
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.760]   like, "Easy for you to say," or, "How can you do deep work if you have kids?"
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.260]   And I was having such a hard time understanding it for so long because, again, I was so logical
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.580]   about it.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:05.620]   The way she explains it, it's like, "Oh, that makes complete sense."
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:11.580]   The underlying thing is not, "I have my kid with me at the office," or something, and
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.380]   "He's interrupting me when I'm trying to do deep work," or something.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.380]   That always just confused me.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   I was like, "Well, when you work, you work.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.140]   When you're at your office, you're at the office.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.140]   Do more deep than shallow work.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.580]   What does that have to do with..."
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.620]   And the way she explained it, like, "No, it's especially for moms.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.020]   You're being distracted by your kids and your families, even when you're not there with
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.180]   your kids and your families."
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.180]   Due to the guilt, right?
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.180]   The guilt.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.820]   Dudes don't have that as much.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.300]   It's like, this is probably wiring stuff.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.900]   We're like, I don't know, we're out there dragging back elk carcasses to the cave and
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.660]   we've like, "That's what we're supposed to be doing."
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.900]   You know, it's, we're wired in some way, we don't feel that guilt.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.860]   So they're there even when they're not there.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:54.320]   So that was a big confusion I had because I was like, "Is everyone, are people working..."
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.860]   This was pre-pandemic.
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.660]   Now this is a different situation.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.780]   I was like, "Is everyone working at home without childcare?
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.780]   This doesn't make sense."
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.180]   But no, the guilt follows you even when you're at the office.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:09.380]   And then just the unequal distribution of household work.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.100]   The women do more than the men.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.440]   And even if you're not doing that while you're at the office, it takes away from the energy
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.020]   and ability to do that extra, like that extra hour in the evening to like, "I can put my
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:24.240]   email off until the night and get more deep work done at the office."
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.480]   And so I think that was useful.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.760]   I get why people are emotional about the topic.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.760]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   So that's good.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.720]   So I'm glad we had her on.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.600]   She, you know, just making that kind of comparison to sports.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.520]   I have a couple of buddies that coach in the NFL and I always kind of ask them about, you
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.620]   know, and they talk about how like even professional athletes need to constantly be coached, you
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.820]   know, I mean, NFL coaches do that.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.900]   And what she was saying, like revisit your values.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.980]   I mean, that's like kind of coaching yourself and you constantly need to coach yourself
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.420]   to like stay grounded and true to your values.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.540]   You got to keep coming back to that.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.700]   You got to do it in partnership with your partner.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.980]   Like that makes a big difference.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.540]   Like you have to be on the same page.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:18.240]   I've seen that not rip apart families, but it's definitely a anecdotally a source of
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:26.160]   stress that some families have come across or they've sent me messages have is if you
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.040]   and like your husband or your wife are doing your own thing.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:36.560]   And the idea is like you're each your independent fiefdom, your careers, each your own thing.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   And we're each just trying to like, we shouldn't interfere with each other.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560]   It's not fair or stuff like that.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.540]   It doesn't really work out as compared to like we're on the same page trying to figure
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.660]   out like what, how is our family going to make money?
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.660]   How are we going to find fulfillment?
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.060]   How are you find actualization?
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.580]   How does work fit into this bigger picture?
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.060]   Because otherwise you get through this weird sort of tit for tat situation of like, well,
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.380]   wait a second, how many hours did you spend versus me?
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.960]   Or like now, if I'm going to spend two years doing this in my career, then it'll be your
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:07.100]   two years, like this weird sort of accounting and resentment that happens.
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.900]   And that kind of comes out of this as well.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:13.560]   It's an implication of what y'all was saying is like, you probably need to be building
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:18.000]   a common vision for your family, that work is going to be a big factor in because it's
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.820]   going to be the source of income and a one among several sources of personal satisfaction
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:24.200]   for both of you.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:29.180]   So we got to figure out how work enters a bigger picture that you're trying to shape.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.080]   But when you, maybe this is a millennial thing.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.940]   We've talked about this on the show before, where we were presented when we were young
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:38.160]   with the idea that work should be your passion and the main source of your meaning.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.760]   And it's like, no, work first and we figure everything else out.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:43.860]   Bad things seem to follow.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:49.820]   Or if it's like, I've seen this a lot of times, like this is a big opportunity.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.640]   We got to just do this job wise and we'll figure everything out later, even if it's
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.600]   basically like devastating for the family, because there's this mindset of like, well,
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.880]   I'm not going to turn down a work opportunity.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.720]   Like she said, when she, you know, counsels couples, she has 10 different buckets that
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.720]   they go through.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720]   Yeah, man.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.720]   I was thinking about that.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.720]   I was like, that's a lot.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.720]   I know.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   You need a spreadsheet to keep track.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720]   A lot of topics.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.160]   We're going to need a spreadsheet to keep track of it, but that's great.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:22.760]   And so my, my, my, like one of my big takeaway messages I came from this is like, uh, I like
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.920]   to get these really practical, ideal takeaways.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.080]   It's like just thinking a lot of it is like comfort in, you know, if you're a professor,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:36.040]   you know, I have a plan that's going to get me tenure and have me do interesting work
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.080]   on things I think are important in a way that's sustainable with other things are important
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080]   to me in my life.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:44.400]   If I have a plan to do that, I should be happy with it.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.080]   Even if that tenure comes three years later than this person, even if like you're like
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.000]   an associate for a while, even if these other people are getting, you know, more fetid.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.560]   Um, and, and I'll talk about this in a later episode, but I'm realizing how much of my
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.800]   slow productivity philosophy is coming out of a reaction to entering this phase of parenthood
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.800]   for me, where my boys need so much time for me way more than when they were younger and
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:14.520]   slow productivity in some sense is a partially a tool for this type of situation.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.760]   You're like, I can't, I actually have to temper my ambition.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.880]   Some, I have less hours and slow productivity is a productivity philosophy.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   That's okay with that.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.200]   It's like, yeah, that's fine.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.460]   You have less hours, but wait.
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.920]   Do stuff you're proud of, you know, uh, at a reasonable pace at a natural pace.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920]   Don't overload yourself.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.720]   You want to look back 10 years and say, I did this, this, this, and this, which I'm
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720]   very impressed by.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.880]   Uh, it doesn't matter that you're spending 30% less time than you were five years ago.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.880]   Like who cares?
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.440]   Like in the end you can come away 10 years from now having produced a lot of good stuff.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.200]   So slow productivity maybe is really just my way of dealing with, I just have a lot
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.560]   less time than I used to.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.640]   Plus when they get to high school, they're not going to hang out with you anyway.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   So yeah, then I'm advantage of it.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:01.360]   I'm going to be doing a lot less productivity to drown my sadness of them ignoring me.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.320]   I'm going to be shooting emails off at six in the morning so that I can distract myself
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.320]   from my grief.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.320]   Um, all right.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.220]   So I want to real briefly before we, before we wrap up, uh, a listener sent a article
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:16.240]   to the interesting account, new product, com email address.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.400]   I just want to talk about it briefly.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.360]   I just, it seemed timely.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.480]   Elon Musk just took over Twitter.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.560]   Recently we've covered social media, Elon Musk, the role of social medias in people's
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560]   lives.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   I just want to point out one factoid from this audience that I find to be optimistic
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.760]   and validating some of my predictions.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.160]   So this is a Reuters article.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   I have it on the screen here.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.120]   If you're watching on the YouTube channel, that's from October 25th.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.080]   So it's from a week or so ago.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.040]   Um, all right.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.060]   So this is an article about what they call heavy tweeters and they note heavy tweeters
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.920]   account for less than 10% of monthly overall users, but generate 90% of all tweets.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.480]   So we've heard this about Twitter before a small group of people do most of the tweeting.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:07.240]   Uh, there's a report that leaked that showed that heavy tweeters are in absolute decline.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.400]   So I think that's interesting.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.800]   They had a, here's a slightly more extended definition of heavy tweeter.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.480]   Uh, someone who logs in the Twitter six or seven times a week and tweets about three,
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   uh, four times a week.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.920]   So honestly heavy tweeter here, it's not really that heavy, but still, um, and they're in
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.320]   absolute decline.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.720]   And so they did a little bit of a deep dive and said, part of it is that interest in world
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:37.760]   news as well as liberal politics showed spikes during major events, but the categories have
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.920]   since lost the highest number of heavy Twitter users and have shown no signs of recovery.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.600]   So, so basically, uh, I think this is positive.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.600]   What we're finding is, you know, people who were doing a lot of political tweeting really
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.760]   had lots of takes on things that were going on are leaving Twitter, uh, and aren't coming
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   back.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.040]   I think that's positive for Twitter, positive for our nation's mental health.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:08.360]   If I have to guess what's going on there, it's, you know, uh, it rhymes with brump.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:15.240]   You know, we had a certain president leave office who I think was a big generator of
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.640]   tweets, uh, from both sides.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.000]   And I think the early pandemic generated a lot of, uh, tweeting as well about pandemic
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.420]   stuff and policy and everyone was at home.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:30.300]   And so with Trump out of office and people no longer up to their eyeballs and pandemic
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.320]   stuff because everything's open and they're going on with their lives, they're leaving
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.520]   this platform.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.400]   It's been, it burnt them out.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.040]   It hasn't been super positive for them.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.480]   I think that's a really good sign.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:49.480]   The other group of heavy users who are leaving are, uh, a group that is users who are interested
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.620]   in fashion or celebrities such as the Kardashian family.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.480]   They're just going to other platforms that are more visually appealing.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.200]   They're going to tick talk, they're going to Instagram.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.560]   So I care less about that, but I think, I don't know.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.440]   I think this is positive that the, the, the very online people who are on there about
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.600]   political issues all the time, they're done.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.800]   I think they're burnt out.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.320]   Plus pandemic, they're like, okay, uh, let's move on with life.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.480]   You know, the bars are open again.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.980]   Let's go get a drink.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:18.980]   Bad news for Twitter.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:19.980]   Sure.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:20.980]   But who cares?
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:24.080]   Cause that's the point I've been making again and again on the show.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.960]   Uh, Twitter is being covered by the media as if it is at the core of our democracy,
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.600]   but that's mainly because media types use Twitter all the time.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.960]   It's at the core of their lives.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.340]   That's a narrow demographic.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.440]   Most of the country doesn't care about Twitter.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.840]   It's not that important.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.920]   Um, it's only important to reporters.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.200]   I'm generalizing a course.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:46.480]   So, you know, when I see these sort of shifts happening, heavy political Twitter users leaving
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.640]   Twitter, I think that's probably better for the mental health of the country, better for
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.480]   the mental health of social media users, better for the future of social media.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:02.160]   So I, I filed this under, uh, good news for most people, unless I guess your last name
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.160]   is Musk.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.780]   So I don't know.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.780]   Good news, right?
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.800]   Jesse, less people using Twitter.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.400]   They can do other things with their time.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.520]   Twitter melts people's brains.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.880]   No one's happy on Twitter.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.200]   Read more books, read more books.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.200]   Um, sounds good to me.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.200]   All right.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.520]   Also sounds good as wrapping up this episode.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:26.200]   Thank you, uh, to Yale for coming on and thank you for the listener who sent me this news
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.200]   article.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.440]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.680]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.460]   (upbeat music)
