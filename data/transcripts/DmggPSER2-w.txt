[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Hi, Kal.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.400]   I have a follow-up question to two concepts you've been talking about.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   How does one combine the practice of four buckets, the four-bucket approach, perhaps
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.680]   maybe a bit for the beginners of the deep life practice with the strategic value-based
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:42.960]   planning, the multi-layered, multi-dimensional practice you've been describing you follow?
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:54.240]   I've been struggling with finding a place for the four buckets in the strategic weekly
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.340]   and daily planning.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.360]   I find it somehow unnatural to combine these two, and therefore your thoughts on it would
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360]   be appreciated.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.840]   Well, this is a good question.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.300]   These two things are related, but they don't accomplish the same goal.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.120]   Let's try to isolate each of these approaches and underscore what they're meant for.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.800]   So we're talking about the multi-scale planning, the values-based multi-scale planning.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.840]   For those who are unaware, this is the idea where you have a list of your values.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.200]   You use those values to help create a strategic plan for the current semester or quarter,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240]   depending on how you like to divide up time.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.560]   You then use that strategic plan or semester plan or quarter plan to influence your weekly
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   plan each week.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160]   Let me look at that when I create my weekly plan.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.280]   What do I need to do this week to make progress on that bigger picture plan?
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.480]   And then your weekly plan informs your daily time block plan.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.640]   That's value-based multi-scale planning.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.680]   For me, that is the crux of how I actually intentionally deploy my time.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.080]   It's what makes sure that all the different things that are important to me and my career
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   are getting attention and that we move from the values at the highest level down to what
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.840]   am I doing right now on the lowest level.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200]   All right, now let's look at the bucket-based system.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.560]   The bucket-based system is an exercise that helps try to move your life closer to the
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.200]   ideal of the deep life.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.920]   The idea here, for those who don't remember from when we talked about this a lot earlier
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.320]   in the podcast, is that you define what we call a bucket for each of the important areas
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   of a life well-lived.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.560]   So you might have craft, which covers your work, or other types of creative endeavor.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.920]   You have community, your connection to family, friends, and those around you.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   You might have constitution.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000]   In the classic four-bucket list, you'd have constitution, which is your health, and then
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   you would have contemplation, which covers things like ethics, philosophy, and theology.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   Those were the classic four.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600]   There's other ones we've talked about as well.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.920]   You can break them up as you want.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560]   You don't have to make them alliterative either.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.500]   I just like to do that.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.320]   So in the bucket method, you have these buckets for the areas of your life that are important.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.280]   Step one, you establish a keystone habit for each of these buckets, something you do every
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.480]   day and track, something that's not trivial, but also something that's not impossible,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.600]   as a way of signaling to yourself that you take each of these areas of your life seriously
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.720]   and you're willing to do non-urgent, non-forced, non-trivial activity towards the advancement
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.040]   of each of these different parts of your life.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   They're all important.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   The next step of the bucket-based method is to then dedicate four to six weeks to each
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.320]   of these buckets to really thinking about that part of your life and big picture changes
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.960]   you want to make, overhauling that part of your life.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.600]   So when you have those four to six weeks on constitution, you're really rethinking your
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.760]   health and your fitness and how that's organized in your life, et cetera.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.880]   So I see the bucket-based system as, it's almost like a one-time project-based exploration
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   overhaul of your life.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.680]   You want to make sure that you're updating your various rules and habits and systems
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.160]   that you run your life with to be better in tune with what is important to you, that your
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.320]   life is aimed closer towards that that is deep.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.120]   It's not unlike saying, "Okay, what I'm going to do is hire someone to come and overhaul
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.400]   my closet and get my clothing up to speed.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   I don't like the way I'm dressing."
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.720]   You know, it's like a one-time thing you're doing because you want to dress better.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.760]   The bucket-based system is, "I'm going through this thing.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.400]   It's going to take me maybe five or six months.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.040]   I'm going to come out of it on the other end with my life better aligned with what's important
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   to me."
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   So think of it that way.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.280]   It's an exercise in intentional life overhauling.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   Value-based multi-scale planning is how you live your life.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.440]   That's actually how you organize and structure your life into perpetuity.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   That is the structure of how your life goes.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   You have the plan for the semester, which influences the weekly plan, which influences
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   the daily time block plan.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   It's how your system, your regularly applied system for actually making sense of your time.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.760]   That's just the backdrop of how I actually make sense of what I should be doing next.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.080]   And the bucket system is this one-time improvement or overhaul or optimization of your life.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.800]   Now where do these things actually formally intersect?
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.060]   Well, if you're going through this exercise of keystone habits followed by one-by-one
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.280]   overhauling your buckets, that's going to show up in your semester or quarterly plan.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.800]   That's where those worlds actually intersect.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.520]   "Hey, one of the things I'm doing this semester is I am now in the middle of the overhaul
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.440]   of the craft bucket.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.560]   And here's my thoughts on that."
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.500]   So you see that when you look at your semester plan each week.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.240]   And so each week you're actually making sure there's time put aside to make progress on
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   that.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.100]   And when you get to each day, when it's relevant, you actually have the time blocked off in
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.160]   that day to make progress of it.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   So that's where they formally intersect.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.680]   It's going to show up on your strategic semester quarterly plan.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.780]   So that'll percolate down to your actual action.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.040]   But the character of these two things is different.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   I'll say it one more time.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.720]   The multi-scale planning is a persistent system for making sense and organizing your available
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.900]   time.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.960]   The bucket system is more of a one-time overhaul to align your life better with your values
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.920]   to make your life deeper than it was before you started the exercise.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.080]   All right, so that's a good question.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.880]   All right, let's move on to another call now.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.280]   This one has to do with notes and meeting preparation.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
