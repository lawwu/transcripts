[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.840]   - Well, this week is exciting for me.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.720]   It's the scheduled launch week for my new book,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.880]   God, Technology, and a Christian Life.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   I've been wanting to write this and publish this book
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740]   for several years now.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.080]   It's a dream of mine.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.240]   Back when I wrote my book,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.320]   12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.600]   it proved to be a book that was harder to write
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.440]   than I expected.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.760]   It was harder to write because I couldn't find
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960]   a baseline theology of technology
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.480]   that would orient my thinking
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.020]   towards the smartphone specifically.
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020]   I came to see that there's like a theological gap,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.880]   a lacking foundation in how Christians think
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.960]   about modern day technology, digital technology,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200]   big tech, Silicon Valley, those things,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.720]   and it surprised me.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.860]   And without that foundation,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.880]   I had to sort of build as much of it as I could myself.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.960]   And so I wrote a little 10-page introduction
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.520]   in my smartphone book.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.160]   I called it A Little Theology of Technology,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.640]   and it was published there on pages 29 to 39
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.880]   of 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.900]   It's very little, 10 pages indeed,
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.080]   but I knew this little theology of technology
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680]   would need to become a larger theology of technology.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.040]   And I knew if I could pull this off,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.000]   it would serve a real need in the church.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320]   In other words, we need to ask the question,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.000]   what is God's relationship to big tech?
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.320]   What does he think of space travel, nuclear power,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.360]   and the big agricultural innovations
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.560]   we depend on for our food every day?
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.040]   That's what I'm trying to figure out,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.720]   because only once we can answer this question
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.020]   can we figure out our relationship to big tech.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.860]   So I'm thrilled to announce that my theology of technology,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.200]   my big theology of technology is written,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.780]   it's done, it's printed, and it's out.
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.280]   Pastor John kindly took the time to read it,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.960]   he liked it, and he wanted to use this Wednesday slot
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680]   in the podcast to share his thoughts with you
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.880]   about my book, which is a little awkward for me
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.520]   as the host of this podcast, but it's super kind of him.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760]   Here's what he had to say.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   - If you can see me and hear me,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   you are among the most technologically advanced
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980]   human beings in the history of the world.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.780]   Yes, you are.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.800]   And probably, like me, you take that for granted.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.480]   And we'll be taking for granted very soon
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.640]   probably self-driving cars and artificial intelligence
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   and robots and human genetic engineering,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.220]   all of them as if they were just as normal as an iPhone.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.520]   There are only a few people in the world
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   who are asking the question,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   how does a big God relate to big technology?
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.540]   Especially Bible-saturated people, thoughtful people.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.460]   Especially also, given the fact that the word big
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.460]   in big tech and big God are infinitely disproportionate,
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.920]   you may know the name Tony Reinke
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.820]   from being the host of Ask Pastor John,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.080]   or you may know him as the author of
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.440]   "12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You."
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.480]   Tony has written a book called
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680]   "God, Technology, and the Christian Life."
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   It is a panoramic and penetrating book.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.760]   I don't think there is a more sweeping treatment
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   of technology so tethered to the infallible scriptures
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   and therefore so realistic and so hopeful, hopeful.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.640]   Tony's not anti-technology.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.300]   He calls himself a tech optimist.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.940]   In fact, he's glad he lives in the computer age.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.980]   In fact, let me read to you a quote
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580]   that was amazing to me.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580]   "Our safe jets, reliable cars, intelligent phones,
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.420]   medical options, household appliances,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.420]   streaming video, digital music have upgraded each of us
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.100]   to a tech wealth beyond Rockefeller's wildest imagination.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.980]   Nearly every middle-class American today is richer
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.980]   than was America's richest man a mere 100 years ago."
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.980]   But Tony's tech optimism doesn't flow from confidence
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.020]   in Elon Musk or artificial intelligence
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.980]   or human genetic engineering.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.060]   It flows from the fact that in the Bible,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   Tony finds the reality of a sovereign, massive,
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.220]   glorious God of providence, infinite wisdom,
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.580]   infinite knowledge that simply dwarfs
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.420]   all the powers of big tech.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.980]   That's what he finds, that's where his confidence comes from
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.900]   so that what happens when you read this book
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.340]   is that your theology is exposed.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.340]   You discover whether or not your feelings and thinkings
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.140]   about the greatest technological marvels
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.140]   causes you to see God as vastly greater.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.780]   Is your God big enough to make
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.700]   the greatest technological marvel
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   look like a first grade arithmetic book or not?
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.060]   For me personally, reading this book
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.300]   was a worship experience
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.740]   because the bigger technology became,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.740]   and Tony makes it big, the more beautiful Christ became.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.900]   Tony says this, "The angels in heaven are not bowing down
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.820]   to the wonders of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.540]   The angels in heaven are bowing down to the glories
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.020]   and the agonies of Jesus Christ."
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.100]   It was a worship experience,
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.100]   so my prayer is that that's what it will be for you
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.500]   when you read "God, Technology, and the Christian Life"
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.140]   by Tony Ranke.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.500]   - Amen, amen, amen.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.780]   That was my aim, a worship experience of the creator
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.500]   whose generosity adorns our tech-filled lives.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.980]   My new book, "God, Technology, and the Christian Life"
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.980]   is now available at Amazon,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.660]   and for a short time you can get it for 50% off
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.180]   from our friends at Westminster Bookstore.

[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.780]   I am your host, Tony Ranke, and we'll be back on Friday.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.820]   Thanks for listening.
