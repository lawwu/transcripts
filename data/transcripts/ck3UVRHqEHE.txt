[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.360]   We'll come back to Portfolio Rescue, where we take questions straight from you, the viewers.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.940]   Duncan, it feels like there's a lot of people drowning these days in the markets. I have
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.260]   two main questions people need to ask themselves right now. This is Ben Carlson's two-part
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.040]   risk tolerance questionnaire. I don't have a big list of questions, I've got two. When
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.360]   do I need the money? How much can I afford to lose in the meantime, both mentally and
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.820]   financially, before you cry uncle and have to tap out? I think every decision you make
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.660]   when investing more or less branches off of these two questions. Unfortunately, it's way
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.280]   easier to answer these questions in a bull market than a bear market, because our perception
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.500]   of risk changes in up markets and down markets. There was a study done where they looked at
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.540]   professional institutional investors and how they felt about the market being either overvalued
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.000]   or undervalued based on the weather. And when it was cloudy outside, more institutional
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.180]   investors were apt to say, "The markets are overvalued." And when it was sunny outside,
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.340]   they were more apt to say, "It's undervalued." And it actually showed that they traded more
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340]   when things were cloudy than when they were sunny.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.340]   Interesting.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.100]   So, I guess maybe there needed to be more traders in California.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.320]   I guess it makes sense, right? You're inside more, I guess.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480]   Yeah. Yeah. See, this is why I live in Michigan, because it's crappy part of the year and I
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.920]   have to balance things out a little bit. But this is why I think it's so important to not
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520]   only have an investment plan in place, that seems obvious to most people, but I think
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   this is also why you need rules in place to guide your actions. You need to set good decisions
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.240]   ahead of time, beforehand, so you're not making these decisions right now. Because if you're
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.040]   trying to come up with a plan on the fly right now, it's going to be way harder, because
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.640]   your emotions are either good or bad. They are. That's what makes us human. So, you can't
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.480]   really ignore those emotions and push them to the side. They're going to happen regardless.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.200]   I was out jogging the other day, and I jogged through this neighborhood, and there was a
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.240]   kid running out of his house. I think he must have been trying to get to his parents' car
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.560]   or the bus or something. And you know when you see something out of your periphery? And
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   this kid is running right at me. He didn't see me. And he's about to run into me. He's
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.100]   about three feet away. And you know you get your fight or flight instinct? I kind of did
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400]   this and jumped. And the little kid looks at me like, "What are you jumping for, dude?"
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   And it's like, because I thought I saw danger coming out of the savanna or whatever. So,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.560]   like those emotions you have, that flinch reaction is going to be real. So, if you don't
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040]   have something in place ahead of time that's rules-based that you can follow, come hell
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.680]   or high water, I think it's really difficult to invest in a market like this. That's just
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.560]   all over the place. One day, it seems like things are fine. The next day, it's things
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.720]   like, "Okay, the world is coming to an end again." It's just really tough if you don't
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   have a process in place.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.260]   See, I think I was that little kid, but I never looked up and I ran right into the street.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.460]   That's how I feel.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.940]   I think I saved his life. All right, remember, if you have a question, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.220]   Let's get into our first one.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.020]   Okay. So, first up, we have the following. "I'm 50 years old and just started investing
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.100]   for the first time in February. I was promptly kicked in the private parts as a welcome to
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.940]   the party from the stock market. With little to no knowledge of investing, it looks like
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.700]   ETFs and index funds are safer than individual stocks. Is this the way to go for newbie investors
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.600]   like me who really don't know anything more than the basics, or is it better to be buying
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.020]   the dip in individual stocks now and holding for the next 10 years?"
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.580]   Hey, whoever this is, tell them to send us their address. Send them a copy of my book,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.420]   because I have a whole chapter here about starting late. So, start at 50. My advice
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.760]   is, it's not really the end of the world. You can still do it. You just have to remember
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.340]   that saving matters more than investing. So, I think it's the perfect time for this kind
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.940]   of talk. If you just started investing at 50. The first thing to understand is that
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.080]   professionals have a much harder time beating the market than almost anyone, right? So,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.700]   if professionals can't do it, according to Standard & Poor's, the 10 years through the
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.260]   end of 2021, 86% of all domestic stock mutual funds underperformed their benchmark.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.000]   These people do this for a living. They went to good schools. They got their CFA designation.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.780]   They look at this stuff all the time. They're talking to company management. They're doing
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.760]   channel checks and supply chain checks, and they still underperform the market. I understand
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.140]   why people want to pick stocks. It's fun. I mean, it's not fun now, but it can be fun
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.100]   when things are going up. It's entertaining. It can help you learn, but it's not easy.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580]   I think a lot of people are finding that out right now, because Duncan, we're frankly getting
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.100]   a lot of questions from people who are realizing this and saying, "Hey, I thought I was going
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.060]   to be a stock picker. I'm not." I think everyone has to go through that in some way. I thought
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.340]   I was going to be ... I read The Intelligent Investor when I first started investing. I
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.540]   thought I was going to be the next Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. It's not easy.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.140]   Index funds, listen, they're boring, right? But boring is beautiful when it comes to investing.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.920]   So what do you do? I have a three-word plan for this person. Dollar, cost, average. That's
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.140]   it. This is the perfect market for it, right? The market is down and it's extremely volatile.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.660]   It's all over the place. This is the perfect environment to add to your account periodically.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.200]   And especially if you're 50 years old, and you have 10, 15, maybe 20 years left to really
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.220]   jumpstart your savings and your retirement, your savings are going to matter way more
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.520]   than your retirement, than your investment returns, because you don't have as much time
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.640]   to go out compounding to kick in. So, let's say you decided to put $100 a week every Friday
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.380]   into the S&P 500. It started this year. No matter what, you're a buyer. Put up the first
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.620]   chart here, John. The amounts don't matter, but this is SPY. Just put in the S&P 500 index
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.720]   fund. This is the amount of shares that $100 would have bought. You can see it's going
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.300]   up over time. And the number of shares isn't important here, but the only thing that matters
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.060]   here is that it's going up. And that's the great thing about dollar, cost, averaging,
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.060]   is that in a down market, you're going to be buying more shares. You were talking about
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.800]   this a couple of weeks ago, Duncan, maybe last week, right? That you're paying more
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.780]   attention to your shares than everything. That's the beauty of dollar, cost, averaging.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.180]   All right. I wrote this one in April, 2020, about like when dollar, cost, averaging matters
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.700]   the most. So, John, pull up this other chart about dollar, cost, averaging. I wrote this
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.100]   in April, 2020. So, the numbers will be higher now, but I just said, let's say you put $100
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.220]   a month every month, starting in 2007 through 2020. And then this graph shows the growth
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.940]   of each of those $100 purchases. How much did it turn into? So, each of those one individual
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.980]   dollar, cost, averaging purchases into the stock market, the S&P, what did it grow into?
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.960]   You can see the spike there in 2008 and 2009, when you were buying towards the bottom. But
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.640]   even as you were buying into the teeth of it, the growth of those dollars is much higher.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.220]   You can see it goes down over time because the stock market was going up and you're buying
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.900]   fewer shares. And again, this is into the teeth of the March 2020 correction, so these
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.340]   numbers would all be higher. But the beauty of dollar, cost, averaging is that you're
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.420]   diversifying across time, you're diversifying across market environment and economic environment.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.060]   And the other thing to remember is that most normal people, dollar, cost, average, not
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.340]   because they want to, but because they have to, because they're saving out of their paycheck.
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.660]   And then they naturally invest periodically over time. And that's a good thing, because
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.460]   it's a really hard strategy to beat when you're just buying periodically. And when markets
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.220]   are high, you're buying fewer shares and markets are low, you're buying more shares. And guess
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.980]   what? Right now you're buying more shares. That's actually a good thing. So, instead
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.860]   of trying to outsmart the market and pick stocks and jump in and out right now, just
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.340]   pick a timeframe. Every two weeks, every week, every month, whatever it is, I'm going to
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.580]   be buying stocks. And that's the rules-based part of this I was talking about, where you
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.500]   can shut your brain off a little bit and worry about other stuff because you know you have
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.980]   this plan in place to just buy, buy, buy over time. And over the long term, that's a really
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.100]   hard strategy to beat.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.580]   Right. And yeah, I mean, this is one of those things where people overthink it too. People
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.800]   are like, "Well, aren't there certain days of the week that are better traditionally?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.700]   Certain months of the year that are better?" And I feel like people sometimes really, really
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.860]   overthink the dollar-dollar strategy.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.380]   We got a question from someone a couple weeks ago that was like, "Listen, on the 15th of
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.260]   every month and the last day of every month, aren't there a bunch of 401(k) purchases?
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.140]   So, what if I invested ahead of those and tried to get ahead?" And it's like, if that
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.020]   stuff's not already priced into the market, I'm sorry. And if Jim Simons hasn't figured
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.260]   it out yet, then you're probably not going to. But yeah, I think trying to overthink
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.220]   these things and make it more complicated.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.020]   The beauty of dollar-cost averaging is that it's simple. Right? It doesn't require a lot
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.300]   of heavy lifting on your brain. And that's what you need right now. You want to give
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.460]   your brain a break during markets like this, because you're in that tense position, like
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.180]   I was when the little kid was running after me and I was running for my life.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.100]   Speaking of which, did you see, talking about the timing, Eric Balchunas shared the other
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.260]   day that there's a new ETF that is literally buying at the close and selling at the open.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.340]   Like, that's what the strategy behind the ETF is. It's kind of interesting.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.420]   That's a problem. I always say that complex solutions don't require complex problems.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.460]   And the market at times is very complex. Right now, I've been saying for recent weeks, if
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.260]   you're not confused, then you're not really paying attention. And it's very confusing
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.180]   right now, what's going on. And so, I think in that instance, it's not like you want to
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.620]   press and try harder and make things more complicated. You want to actually simplify
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.620]   and make things easier.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   Right.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.540]   We have another one.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.380]   Okay. Up next, we have a short and sweet one, but probably one that's going to piss some
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380]   people off.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.780]   "The data against crypto being an inflation hedge has been mounting for over a year now.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.700]   Can we finally put the argument to bed and call it a myth?"
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.580]   Alright. John, throw up the chart here first of inflation rate vs. Bitcoin vs. gold. Because
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.220]   I think we have to pull gold in here a little bit, too. So, over the last year, you can
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:22.420]   see inflation is 8.3%. Bitcoin is down 35%, call it, depending on how you look. Gold is
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.860]   down 3% over the last year. So, finally, we get the highest inflation we've had in 40
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.220]   years. Inflation finally bursts out. And what everyone wanted to think was an inflation
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.700]   hedge, gold and Bitcoin, haven't really worked that well. Gold worked for a little bit. Bitcoin,
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.260]   for a little bit. It's not really happening.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.660]   I think the problem here, of course, some people are trying to dance on the grave of
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.260]   Bitcoin and say, "Haha, we told you." But, crypto is a risk asset. It's still relatively
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:54.100]   new. It's still almost in the growth/startup phase. So, I think that's part of it that
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.740]   I think a lot of people are realizing. It's like, okay, when risk happens, then this stuff
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.420]   is going to get hit, too. That shouldn't surprise too many people.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.060]   There's this old saying that -- I want to talk about gold again real quick, because
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.460]   I think gold and Bitcoin are a good analogy here. It took gold a while to get to that
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.940]   point where it was this really store of value. But there's this old saying that an ounce
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.940]   of gold could buy a fine men's suit when Jesus walked the earth, and it can still do so now.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.140]   I think if you go to a men's warehouse, you can buy six of them for one.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.300]   But, John, show the real gold price since 1980 here. This is inflation-adjusted gold
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.620]   since 1980. You can see the high in, I think, 1981. We're still below those same levels
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.860]   on an inflation-adjusted basis. So, even over the long term, gold has been a great store
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.060]   of value, but that long term can be really, really long. So, it doesn't always work like
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.220]   this. I think sometimes there's these misconceptions about assets like this. The problem is, especially
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.420]   over the short term, there's really no asset that gives you one-to-one inflation hedge.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.500]   Tips are pretty good for inflation because it tracks it, but even then, you're really
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.380]   only hedging against unexpected inflation. So, expected inflation is reflected in the
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.420]   yield. So, tips are up 6% in 2021, which is great, because the ag, which is like, if you
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.940]   owned a bond index fund, like the ag or BND at Vanguard, that was down 2%. So, tips did
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.060]   great in 2021. But this year, they're down 6% because rates are rising, and because that
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.460]   expected inflation was built into the yield. The yield got negative on a nominal basis,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.140]   even though you're getting that kick from inflation. Tips are down this year. So, stocks
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.380]   offer a wonderful hedge against inflation long term. I've said this comment before,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.860]   dividend yields grow 2% over the rate of inflation over the long term. Earnings grow over the
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.680]   rate of inflation. Stocks do, too, of course. But unfortunately, over the short term, sometimes
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.060]   it doesn't work. People get spooked by inflation.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.860]   I think the problem with trying to hedge any macro risk like this over the short term is
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.020]   that you have to be right twice. One, you have to be right about the macro data. That's
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.400]   not easy, but it's not impossible, right? Some people can predict what's going to happen
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.420]   with GDP and unemployment and inflation. But then, the second one is, you have to be right
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.460]   about the reaction from investors, and the reaction from central banks, and what the
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.660]   market environment is. So, this is the really hard one. What is the reaction going to be?
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.600]   Because if you had told people in 2020, going into 2020, the government is going to spend
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.880]   more money than they ever have, trillions of dollars are going to print, there's going
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.000]   to be supply chain problems, there's going to be a war, there's going to be a commodities
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.880]   spike and oil from a war, all this stuff, you would have said, "Okay, gold's going to
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.160]   be up 30%." And gold is basically flat since then or down, right?
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.120]   And I think a lot of people were saying, "Bitcoin can be this hedge against chaos and craziness."
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.060]   And maybe it was. It took off in early 2020, during the pandemic, but it's come down since
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.020]   then. And I think people realize, "Okay, right, there are no one-to-one inflations." Even
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.700]   something like cash has been a good hedge against inflation in the past, because if
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.940]   you have short-term rates that are rising, those get reflected in shorter-term bonds
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.060]   quicker. So, if we talk about cash, we're talking about three-month T-bills for a money
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.940]   market or something, like a savings account. That should be reflected faster in short-term
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.840]   rates. But guess what's not happening? I got my email yesterday from Marcus, my online
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.500]   savings account. They increased my yield by 10 basis points. So, from 60 to 70 basis points.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.160]   Thanks, I guess.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.500]   Maxfield: They're still wagging Robinhood, though. Robinhood's up to 1% now.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.020]   Lewis: That 1% is great against an 8% inflation rate.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.460]   Maxfield: It's a little consolation when your portfolio's down 40%.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.940]   Lewis: (laughs) Well, that 1% looks pretty good then, doesn't it? But my whole point
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.540]   is that, every environment, there's going to be a different sort of hedge that makes
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.100]   sense and sounds good. Honestly, the best hedge for this time around has been a house.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.860]   Because the cost of materials has gone up, the cost of labor has gone up, all these things
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.340]   in a house has done well. Could there be a time when there's an inflationary period and
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.500]   housing does poorly? It's possible. You never know with these things. But right now, a house
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.980]   has probably been the best one-to-one inflation hedge, where housing prices have gone up and
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.780]   your fixed payments stay the same. But there really aren't many where you can say, "This
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:46.260]   is going to hedge inflation no matter what." That's hard for people to understand, to wrap
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.580]   their mind around and accept, but it's true.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.940]   Maxfield: Right. Whenever I need a little crypto pick-me-up, I just look at the Winklevii
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:58.820]   twins, I look at their Twitter, or Scaramucci, Pomp, all those accounts. They make me feel
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.980]   a little better.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.820]   Lewis: Okay. The way to survive a bear market, I tweeted this last week, is not to look at
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.100]   your portfolio, it's to look at the portfolio of someone else who's doing worse than you.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.180]   That makes you feel better. We go from FOMO to, "Oh god, thank god I don't own that."
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.660]   I think it's why so many people were gleefully enjoying the Tara Luna thing. "Oh, someone
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.660]   did worse than me."
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.300]   Maxfield: Yeah. Alright, let's do one more.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.700]   Lewis: Up next, we have a question from Kyle. "Could you please explain to a dullard how
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.220]   capital gains impact your AGI?"
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.180]   Maxfield: That's a word you don't hear too often, right? Dullard?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.100]   Lewis: I know, yeah. I can't not laugh when I read that. "Anyway, can you please explain
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.900]   to a dullard how capital gains impact your AGI and taxable income? I have a taxable account
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.900]   and I'm wondering if it is advantageous for me to be selling the long-term portion of
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.780]   my account and rebuying immediately to realize gains for the year, as my taxable income is
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:55.480]   under the $80,800 limit for married couples. I see sources saying this won't affect my
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.500]   regular income, but when I look at the 1040 tax form, it appears it would still be counted
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.460]   towards my taxable income." I have no idea what they're talking about, so we're going
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   to need help.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.580]   Maxfield: It sounds like you're reading hieroglyphics here. Let's bring in our tax expert, Bill
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.140]   Sweet. It's possible I had to ask him, "Bill, what does AGI mean?" You can try to interpret
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.460]   for us all this means. What are we trying to get out of this here?
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.180]   Sweet: Great, great question from Kyle. Generally, the questions today are just hotter than a
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.780]   blowtorch. I love it. What Kyle's getting at is he's trying to hunt the mythical, the
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.660]   magical 0% long-term capital gains rate. That, to me, is like the kid that was hunting Ben
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.220]   on the Grand Rapids Savannah over the weekend. Best way to answer this question, let's pull
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220]   up a chart.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.020]   John, can you pull up number one? I need to do this in graphic form. Let's take a taxpayer
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:50.660]   that happens to have $50,000 of ordinary income. This is a married filing joint taxpayer. Let's
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:56.020]   take off a standard deduction. Everybody gets that for free. That leaves $24,000 of taxable
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   income. That equates to roughly 10% income tax, so roughly $2,400 of tax. Let's add on
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:09.820]   top of that $50,000 of capital gains. What do we do now? Guess what? The tax is the same.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:15.380]   Because as the taxpayer indicates, long-term capital gains tax rates, if your total income,
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:21.460]   your taxable income, is below $80,800, you are not going to pay anything on long-term
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:27.160]   capital gains or tax-qualified dividends. That is one of the best deals in the tax code.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.820]   It obviously requires you to make a relatively small amount of income. Medium household income
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.260]   in the U.S. is about $70,000 today. But that's a great tax planning tool for somebody who,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.760]   let's say, is young. Let's say you take a pause from work. Let's say you've retired
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.620]   and you have not filed for Social Security. That long-term capital gains rate is extremely,
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.620]   extremely tasty.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.600]   John, can we pull up chart three? What happens if you go over that threshold? Capital gains
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.300]   only applies to the income on top of that threshold. That's what the taxpayer is getting
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:04.740]   at. What your AGI is doesn't matter, particularly if it depends on the nature and the type of
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.740]   income that you have underneath. What I'm trying to display here is the stacking effect.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.820]   You get long-term capital gains on top of the rest of your income. It all depends at
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.180]   the end of the year. It's kind of difficult to plan for. This is what good tax planners
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.580]   do. But that's a great, great, great question for my man, Kyle.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.540]   So this person, they're talking about selling and then trying to realize gains. When does
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.760]   that ever make sense to take that? Isn't it almost always better to just push those taxes
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.460]   out into the future and defer, defer, defer?
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.840]   See, I think it depends. I think he's on to something pretty interesting because each
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:43.420]   year you get that standard deduction of $25,200. Each year you get that $80,000 up to of long-term
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.060]   capital gains rate at 0%. So I think it's actually a really insightful point. Why wouldn't
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.400]   you fill up those 0% tax brackets? Effectively, if he's able to pull it off, he's stepping
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.380]   up his basis every year, Ben.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.620]   So I'd actually say no. If you just defer and you, let's say you have $100,000, you
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.540]   have $200,000 of gains, you rip that all off all in one year to buy a house, retire, take
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.920]   a vacation, you're going to pay tax probably at 15% on most of that. So I think the taxpayer's
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.380]   on to, so Kyle's on to something really interesting. And again, it's something I think that good
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.300]   tax planners can see. It's not each year what matters. It's what is your tax rate over the
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.180]   next 10 years, over the next 20, or even over a lifetime?
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.860]   Difficult to nail. The tax code changes. It can be kind of slippery. My man, Wes, down
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.860]   there in Puerto Rico, maybe he wishes he hadn't realized those gains two, three years ago
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.660]   before he moved. But I think it's a great point by Kyle. And it's something I think
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.980]   that good tax planners think about.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.540]   Kyle is not a dullard then. He knows what he's talking about, kind of.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.460]   No, I think he graduated straight from dullard to tax ninja.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.860]   So I guess to your point, if you have that 80,800 limit or whatever it is, and potentially
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.840]   his income is going to rise over time, take advantage of it now if your income is going
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.620]   to rise and take some of those gains, and then you're not paying as much taxes on them.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.340]   Potentially, yep, got to thread the needle. And do not forget about state income tax.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.020]   That's something that there's no capital gains rate that I'm aware of on most state taxes
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.020]   outside of Tennessee.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.580]   All right, Duncan, next question.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:09.980]   Okay. Question four is from Victor. How does an individual investor get more money into
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.900]   their IRA accounts if they've already met their contribution limit for the year? With
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.380]   the market sell-off intensifying, I think this is a great opportunity for long-term
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:23.420]   index investors like myself. I fund a Roth IRA and a spousal traditional IRA each year.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.540]   I want some investment, tire them out immediately, so I'm fully contributed and invested for
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.100]   2022. Is it possible to make another contribution this year and classify it as a 2023 contribution?
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.260]   All right, I'm going to give -- this may not be applicable here, but the advice Bill has
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:42.500]   given me in the past, since I have some income outside of my employer, then Bill told me
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.180]   four years ago, maybe five years ago, "Ben, what are you doing? Set up a SEP IRA. You
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.980]   can increase your limit that you can give for tax deferred gains." And now every year
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.620]   I fund a SEP IRA in addition to my 401(k). So that's one way. So this person may not
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.860]   have a side hustle or whatever it's called, but that was one thing you did for me. And
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.980]   you said, "What are you waiting for? Fund a SEP IRA."
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.900]   Yeah, I mean, you nailed it, Ben. You got to the answer. I mean, just the quick answer
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   is no.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.900]   Oh, sorry. Did I steal your thunder there?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.980]   No, definitely not. You set me up great with the thunderbolt.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.100]   For the noobs watching, though, can you explain what a SEP is?
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.620]   Yeah, definitely. But just to answer the question quickly, unfortunately, no, you cannot make
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:25.340]   a 2023 IRA contribution in 2022. You can do so retroactively, right? And so in 2023, you
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.860]   can make one for 2022, but the contributions to traditional Roth IRAs are limited per year.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.700]   So unfortunately, unless you've crossed age 50, you're limited $6,500 per year. So that's
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.460]   the total limit there. So let's shift gears. Let's talk about a SEP. Ben, you set me up
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.820]   great. If you happen to have your own business or side hustle, if you're doing something
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:51.380]   that involves self-employment income, you can fund on top of your regular IRA contributions
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.500]   and your spouse contribution, a SEP IRA. The limit is calculated differently, and it's
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:03.180]   tied to 20% of your net taxable income adjusted slightly for self-employment taxes. And so
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.660]   that is an option if this taxpayer has other types of income coming in. Another thing that
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.980]   you could do with self-employment income is set up your own solo 401(k). And if you're
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:18.900]   not funding your $20,500 limit at work, that's another place to go. You can set up also a
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.220]   solo 401(k) tied to your small business income. And so both of those things are an option
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.300]   for a taxpayer with that type of income. I've got two other options, but any questions on
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   that, guys?
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:35.060]   Nope. Duncan, do you know what a SEP stands for? What is it? What is the acronym stand
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   for? I can't even think of it.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.580]   I think it's a self-employed pension. I think that's what it's called.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.580]   OK, that makes sense.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.820]   Yeah, it's just tied to the IRA rules. But two other quick options for our taxpayer here.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.100]   Great, great, great question, by the way. Another thing is an HSA. If you happen to
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.860]   have access to a high deductible health care plan at work, HSAs function a lot like super
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:59.340]   IRAs in that you can sock away up to $7,300 for a married couple per year, take that completely
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.220]   off your income tax in addition to an IRA. And then if you happen to use that money,
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.180]   if you don't use it for medical expenses, it just functions like an IRA, and you get
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.940]   penalty-free distributions once you hit age 65.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.460]   The last option I would throw at this taxpayer, I'm a company man, so I'm going to talk about
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.940]   low-cost ETFs in a basket. Liftoff is our platform. Go to liftoffinvest.com. It's built
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.260]   on Betterment's back engine. Extremely tax-efficient investing option. Or you can think about a
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.660]   direct indexing option. These are non-qualified. They're not IRAs. They don't come with these
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.940]   tax bells and whistles. And we're going to discuss direct indexing on the next question,
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.940]   I believe.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.020]   That's called a transition. Spoiler alert.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.020]   Spoiler alert.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   Yep.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.020]   I'm a pro.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.900]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Brian. I have a question on direct indexing and its
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.340]   benefits versus passive indexing in a taxable account. By the way, we get a lot of questions
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.560]   on direct indexing, so I'm excited to hear your answer to this. I'm planning to open
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.260]   a taxable account with Fidelity and have been researching their direct indexing tool. I
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.860]   currently max out 403(b) and 457(b) accounts through work. I'm planning on investing in
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.340]   this taxable account annually for my working career, which will probably be for the next
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.060]   30 years. And I'm currently in the highest tax bracket. Is there any way to quantify
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.100]   the tax savings and potential benefit of a direct indexing approach over a long time
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.220]   horizon? How do the fees compare? Also, I worry that deciding to change course in the
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.780]   future would leave me stuck with many individual stocks to sell and manage. What are your thoughts?
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.140]   Lewis: We have a lot of experience with direct indexing on our side of things. We use Canvas,
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.860]   which is a platform started by Ashaunus, the asset management, recently sold to Franklin
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:43.660]   Templeton. The number of levers you can pull on this are pretty cool. I think a lot of
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.540]   the ETF people are not fans of direct indexing. They think, "What's the point? We have ETFs.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.940]   They're already tax-efficient. What's the point of it?" There are some interesting things
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.220]   you can do with it. You can do unique investment strategies, because it costs nothing to buy
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.520]   and sell a stock now. I think that is something that a lot of our advisors were concerned
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.500]   about when we first rolled this out, is, "But I'm going to be holding 5,000 stocks or something.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.540]   What does that mean? How hard is that to handle?" I think a lot of these places, if they have
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.680]   it at Fidelity or Vanguard or T. Rowe Price or whatever who's going to do these, and they're
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.620]   going to be coming everywhere soon, so you're going to have the option. But I think for
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   this conversation, the tax-loss-harvesting side of things is probably the easiest, Bill.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.780]   My way of explaining it to people is that even in a good year when stocks are up, so
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.620]   last year, the stock market had a booming year. There's still probably 20% to 25% of
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.180]   stocks in the market that are down, those individual names, and you can use some of
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.700]   those losses to offset gains. Why don't you talk about that, the tax-loss-harvesting portion,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.940]   because that's probably the main selling point for us.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.180]   Yeah. Love this question from Brian. Brian, I think you're right to be skeptical. My opinion
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:52.540]   is direct indexing ain't for everybody. It's not this solve for all the problems of investing,
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.100]   but it does come with some really neat features. Ben, you set me up perfectly. Brian mentioned
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.180]   that he's in the highest income tax bracket, and that's 37% for ordinary income. When I've
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.100]   done the math on the benefits of direct indexing model, and these are all back-tested, unfortunately,
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.700]   I've only been running this live for two, three years, the primary benefit comes from
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:18.180]   the ability to deduct $3,000 per year of capital losses against your ordinary income. And when
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.140]   you happen to be fortunate, by the way, to be in the highest possible income tax bracket,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.740]   that's worth about $1,100 per year. You're able to deduct $3,000 against ordinary income
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:33.140]   at the highest rate. And over time, assuming at the end of the model, whatever sample period
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:39.580]   you've used, it's worth roughly about 40 basis points relative to a non-tax-loss-harvested
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.020]   model. I don't want to get into too much of the details because it's really wonky. Hit
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.180]   me up on email if you really want some charts coming your way. But in general, that's the
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:54.100]   idea. And it all comes from the ability to potentially deduct that $3,000 per year. That's
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.620]   limited by the tax code. The IRS hasn't touched it, I think, since '74 or '78. And back then,
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.900]   that was worth about $15,000 in today's dollars. And so I do expect that benefit to shrink.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.580]   But that's more or less where it comes from. And I do think it's a really powerful thing.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.380]   Wealth indexing doesn't really solve a lot of tax problems today. But in my opinion,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.780]   it solves a lot of distribution problems in the future. But I do want to talk about the
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.740]   specific concern that the investor mentioned, Ben, which was what happens over time. And
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.060]   so, Ben, do you remember-- there was a great Longbird Asset Management study that showed
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.900]   where the market returns come from. Do you remember that chart that just sticks in my
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.860]   head? Yeah. It's all in the tails, right? Yeah. Can you describe it just briefly? Where
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.580]   does it come from? Well, it's basically just that the majority of gains in the stock market
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.500]   come from a handful of stocks. And there's a lot of stocks that do really poorly and
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.820]   go out of business, or just they crash 70%, 80% and never come back, more or less. Yep.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:52.220]   And that's my memory, too. And I remember it roughly at a 2/3, 1/3 ratio. And so everybody
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.580]   knows about the Apples and Amazons, the big winners, over time. But there's this churn
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.420]   that happens on the bottom end of the market, right? And a direct index model allows you
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.580]   to unlock potential tax losses from that segment. But one great criticism of direct indexing
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.340]   is over time, you just end up owning the winners, right? Those become a bigger and bigger part
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.400]   of your portfolio. Yes, you're offsetting losses with gains over time. But my bias is
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.600]   there's always going to be underperforming segments of the market. There's always going
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.780]   to be a part of that. And especially if you're continuing to add to a direct index model,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.380]   it's not static, right? You're adding cash. You're buying a house. You're sending kids
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:32.060]   to college. That, to me, is a really powerful part of direct indexing, because you can predetermine
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:37.020]   ahead of time, what is my taxable exposure? What do I want to see in gains each year?
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.100]   And back to our first question, in a year that your ordinary income is relatively low,
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.380]   hey, I kind of want to realize $100,000 of capital gains this year, right, to fill up
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:52.920]   on a 0% capital gains bracket. And the final point is, you're going to own those stocks
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.940]   if you own them through an ETF or a mutual fund anyway. You just won't be able to segment
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.740]   them for tax purposes when the time comes. They'll be embedded in a broader portfolio.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.020]   So the problems in investing are there. There's really no way to avoid them. But I think directing
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.380]   that indexing offers a lot of solutions, specifically for folks at the higher end of the tax bracket.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.340]   I do think the hard part about direct indexing for a lot of people is going to be, this is
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:19.340]   not like a humble brag, but we have advisors working on this in concert with clients. And
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.740]   there's a lot of back and forth in this. And I think people trying to do it on their own
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.020]   is going to be very difficult. So I think some of these places are going to be in trouble
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.580]   if they try to have people do this on their own and pull the levers themselves, because
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.620]   there is a lot more than one or two decisions that go into this kind of thing.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.940]   Yeah, that's a great point. And that was something we realized very early on, was that we needed
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.740]   to spend a lot of time with our folks, with our operations folks, Patrick Haley, Erica
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.940]   Morrow, and our team to kind of get it right for clients up front. And that's where the
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.980]   heavy lifting was. And I don't know anything about Fidelity or anybody else's model. But
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.460]   I'm skeptical, because I think it's something, to bend to your point, that I think needs
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.020]   a lot of thought ahead of time before you implement.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.340]   All right, one more question.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.940]   I'm really good at the tax loss part of it.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.260]   Everybody is this year, man. Lock them in.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.100]   One follow-up question, though, for people that are a little confused. If you have a
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:15.660]   $10,000 loss this year, you can write off $3,000 over the coming several years, right?
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.580]   Against your income, yeah, per year, right? And then it carries forward, right? So the
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.020]   benefit of direct indexing in theory is that you're stacking those losses up. You're building
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.620]   them up over time to offset a future gain.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.620]   Cool.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.780]   All right, OK. I want to thank Bill for coming on again. Thanks for wearing a tie. Bill,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:34.380]   I decided, I think, in the pandemic, I'm throwing all my ties out. I'm never wearing a tie again.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.820]   So I thank you for carrying the torch.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.380]   It's a choice. It's a choice. I'm a company man. I'm the CFO. I got to play the part,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.380]   man. Come on.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.820]   That's true. You are a suit. All right. Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.820]   Ouch.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.220]   One of these weeks. You wear the ties. Duncan wears the hats.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.580]   Your Midwest bias looking down on us New Yorkers from the pedestal.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.740]   I like how we are like we're like a progression, you know, like dressed up, casual, t-shirt
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.740]   and hat.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   All right.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.660]   I'll pull a Fetterman next time, a hoodie, a beard. I'll pull it off.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.420]   Thanks for everyone who comes to the live chat. We always will take some of the questions
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:13.680]   from there. Occasionally, we'll have questions from the comments on YouTube. Email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.

[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140]   Thank you.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.140]   Thank you.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140]   Thank you.
