[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   I get asked a lot about the safety or lack thereof of Bluetooth headphones.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   You work on the brain.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.480]   You're a brain surgeon.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.880]   That's valuable real estate in there, and you understand about electromagnetic fields.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.360]   Any discussion about EMFs immediately puts us in the category of, uh-oh, get their tinfoil
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   hats.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.000]   And yet, I've been researching EMFs for a future episode of the podcast, and EMFs are
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.080]   a real thing.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.920]   That's not a valuable statement.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700]   Everything's a real thing at some level, even an idea.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.520]   But there does seem to be some evidence that electromagnetic fields of sufficient strength
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.040]   can alter the function of, maybe the health of, but the function of neural tissue, given
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.740]   that neural tissue is electrically signaling among itself.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.160]   So I'll just ask this in a very straightforward way.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.200]   Do you use Bluetooth headphones or wired headphones?
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   Yeah, Bluetooth.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.320]   And you're not worried about any kind of EMF fields across the skull?
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   No.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.040]   I mean, I think the energy levels involved are so tiny that ionizing radiation aside,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.560]   we're way out of the realm of ionizing radiation that people would worry about tumor-causing
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.380]   EMF fields.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.400]   Even just the electromagnetic field itself, as is very well described in a Bluetooth frequency
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.600]   range, the power levels are tiny in these devices.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.880]   And so we are awash in these signals, whether you use Bluetooth headphones or not.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.440]   For that matter, you're getting bombarded with ionizing radiation in a very tiny amount,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.560]   no matter where you live on Earth, unless you live under huge amounts of water.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.480]   It's unavoidable.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.400]   And so I think you just have to trust that your body has the DNA repair mechanisms that
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.140]   it needs to deal with the constant bath of ionizing radiation that you're in as a result
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.360]   of being in the universe and exposed to cosmic rays.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:16.100]   In terms of electromagnetic fields, the energy levels are way, way out of the range where
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.000]   I would be worried about this.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.400]   What about heat?
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   I don't use the earbuds any longer for a couple of reasons.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000]   As you know, I take a lot of supplements and I reached into my left pocket once and swallowed
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.720]   a handful of supplements that included a Bluetooth, an AirPod Pro.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   I knew it.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.400]   I swallowed it the moment after I gulped it down.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.200]   By the way, folks, please don't do this.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.480]   It was not a good idea.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   It wasn't an idea.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   It was a mistake.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.760]   But I could see it on my phone as registering there.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.260]   Never saw it again, so I'm assuming it's no longer in my body, but anyway, there's a bad
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.920]   joke there to be sure.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760]   But in any event, I tend to lose them or misplace them.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.280]   So that's the main reason.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.760]   But I did notice when I used them that there's some heat generated there.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.120]   I also am not convinced that plugging your ears all day long is good.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.060]   There's some ventilation through the sinus systems that include the ears.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.120]   So it sounds to me like you're not concerned about the use of earbuds.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   But what about heat near the brain?
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.680]   I mean, there's the cochlea, the auditory mechanisms that sit pretty close to the surface
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.720]   there.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.000]   Heat and neural tissue are not friends.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.160]   I'd much rather get my brain cold than hot in terms of keeping the cells healthy and
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   alive.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.640]   Should we be thinking about the heat effects of some of these devices or other things?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.920]   Is there anything we're overlooking?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.760]   Well, think about it this way.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.320]   I use cars as an analogy a lot and mostly internal combustion engine cars.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.520]   So these analogies are going to start to be foreign and useless for another generation
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.280]   of people that grew up in the era of electric cars.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:06.160]   But using cars as a platform to talk about fluid cooling systems, your body has a massive
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   distributed fluid cooling system similar to a car's radiator.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.300]   You're pumping blood all around your body all the time at a very strictly controlled
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.740]   temperature.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.400]   That blood carries, it's mostly water.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.920]   So it carries a huge amount of the heat away or cold away from any area of the body that's
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.520]   focused heating or focused cooling.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.720]   So you could put an ice cube on your skin until it completely melts away and the blood
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.020]   is going to bring heat back to that area.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.920]   You can stand in the sun under much more scary heating rays from the sun itself that contain
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.160]   UV radiation that's definitely damaging your DNA.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.700]   If you're looking for things to be afraid of, the sun is a good one.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.920]   You're talking to the guy that tells everybody to get sunlight in their eyes every morning.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.000]   But I don't want people to get burned or give themselves skin cancer.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   I encourage people to protect their skin accordingly.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   And different individuals require different levels of protection from the sun.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.880]   Some people do very well in a lot of sunshine, never get basal cell or anything like that.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.400]   Some people, and it's not just people with very fair skin, a minimum of sun exposure
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.200]   can cause some issues.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   And here I'm talking about sun exposure to the skin.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.280]   Of course, staring at the sun is a bad idea.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   I never recommend it.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.600]   But thinking about the sun just as a heater for a moment to compare it with Bluetooth
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.480]   headphones, your body is very capable of carrying that heat away and dissipating it.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   You know, via sweat evaporation or temperature equalization.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   So any heat that's locally generated in the ear, one, there's a pretty large bony
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   barrier there.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.320]   But two, there's a ton of blood flow in the scalp and in the head in general and definitely
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.200]   in the brain that's going to regulate that temperature.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.080]   So I think certainly there can be a tiny temperature variation, but I doubt very seriously that
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:11.040]   it's enough to cause a significant problem.
