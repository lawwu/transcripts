[00:06:39.460 --> 00:07:09.020]   usability of a 529 plan. Because many families, especially many families, would like to save for their children's college, but they're also going to be committed to making payments for private school tuition along the way. And a 529 plan allows you to set aside the money for those payments to use it in a tax-efficient way and to fund those K-12 expenses. Now, again, there could be some tax savings, but the tax savings will work out best if you have a very young child or if
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:38.600]   and you're using the money and you can get a lot of gain. I don't think the tax savings are the number one reason to use a 529 plan. I think it's useful, but it would work if you have a very young child and you're planning for college, but if you're planning for five-year-old expenses at age 10, five years of earnings on an investment is likely not to be so, so significant. But it can be there. Not denying it can be a factor, just that it's not the number one factor. In my mind, this K-12 open-cast plan is a good idea.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   It's not a tax-efficient plan.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   But it can be there.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   And I think it's useful, but it's not the number one factor.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   And I think it's useful, but it's not the number one factor.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]  obedient: K-12 opens up a tremendous possibility for wealthy parents, wealthy grandparents to fund an expense that they're committed to, often high-priced private school tuition, and to do it in a way that is very flexible and allows them to protect the funds that they have from the claims of creditors. So this is what I really love about 529 plans. Parents, grandparents can put 50 grand, 100 grand into an account, set it aside. It's not inside of a trust, but it is protected from the attacks of creditors, and they can see that it's not a tax-efficient plan.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   It's not a tax-efficient plan.

[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   A small number of U.S. Americans will get some defray of their state-level income taxes with the 529 plan,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.620]   so that can be helpful as well.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   Let's use 95, to age 95, for 45 years of total lifespan.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   That gives us 45 years of investment.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   That gives us 45 years of investment.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   That gives us $50, $50,000,
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:59.920]  harvesting, and assuming that this 50-year-old can invest and earn, say, an 8% rate of return, this one account of $50,000, because it has 45 years available for it, can become worth $1.6 million at their date of death. If they could earn a 10% rate of return, it could be potentially $3.6 million. So there's major value in a 50-year-old accumulating this, and setting it aside as a primary asset,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   So there's major value in a 50-year-old accumulating this, and setting it aside as a primary asset,

[00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   It's a Roth IRA, the taxes have already been paid, now they can take the full distribution out and do whatever they want. If it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   If it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   If it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million,
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:29.980]  , but they would owe taxes on $1.5 million of income. So you can see here why the Roth IRA can be really superior. But what else can they do? Well, they can take required minimum distributions over a couple different options of person's life expectancy. So they can take it off of your life expectancy, but if you're leaving it to a child, they can take the required minimum distributions out on their own life expectancy. So if you left this behind for 10 years,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   If it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   But if it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million, and then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5 million,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   but if you left this behind for 10 years,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   or a 15-year-old or a 20-year-old,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   you can imagine how low the required minimum distributions are from this account.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Now, if you have a million and a half dollars that's tax-free, and you leave it behind as an asset for a young person, that million and a half dollars can basically become a trust fund that provides an income, a lifelong income for the young person, and in many ways could provide for the retirement security of that person.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   So if you have a million and a half dollars that's tax-free, and you leave it behind as an asset for a young person, that million and a half dollars can basically become a trust fund that provides an income, a lifelong income for the young person, and in many ways could provide for the retirement security of that person.

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.100]   So given that this is so good, this has become a primary staple of financial planning advice.

Or what if it were more? What if I left behind a million dollar 401k, and now it's $100,000 per year, and now it's $100,000 per year.

You can quickly see how under the progressive tax system of the United States, a major, major portion of that account would be lost to income taxes. Now, first, let's talk about, is this fair? Is this just? Well, I understand the arguments that would be in favor, for example, let's say we can cry

It fundamentalized the taxing nature of a government entity to say, "We're going to give you this account so you can build up millions and millions of dollars." So then Roth IRAs started to be used and then they started to be exploited by thoughtful, intelligent people. You started to have rollovers. You started to have the backdoor Roth IRA developed.
