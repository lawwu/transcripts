[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, we're going to dig into
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.400]   a piece of pending legislation in the United States Congress and use it to bring out a couple
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.080]   of practical examples that I think will be helpful to you and to me as we try to think about some
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.800]   practical financial planning tools in our own portfolios and as we try to discern the future.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.280]   I think it's an illustrative example and so I'm ready to use it as a teaching point for you.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.800]   The specific piece of legislation that I'm referring to is something called the SECURE
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.560]   Act. The technical name for this legislation is in the House of Representatives H.R. 1994,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   setting every community up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019. There is a corresponding
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.480]   Senate version of this legislation called the Retirement Enhancement Savings Act, but usually
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.560]   this is being referred to as the SECURE Act. For context, I'm recording this podcast on Monday,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.480]   July 15, 2019. As things stand currently, this bill is not yet the law of the land.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.920]   This bill was passed, the House version of this bill was approved by the U.S. House of
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.440]   Representatives on May 23 in a vote of 417 to 3. So an overwhelmingly,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.080]   an overwhelming vote, almost unanimous, of 417 to 3 in favor of the House bill. Now,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.120]   the normal process, it's my understanding that the normal process for this was going to be that
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.040]   the Senate would try to pass its own bill called the Retirement Enhancement Savings Act and then
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.120]   try to bring any gaps or discrepancies between the House version and the Senate bill together
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.880]   in conference. However, it's my understanding that a little bit because of the overwhelming
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.720]   nature of the House vote, the leaders of the United States Senate decided to go ahead and
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.040]   just try to use a legislative maneuver called hotlining and hotline the SECURE Act, which
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   basically means to try to bring this legislation and secure unanimous consent by all senators,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   and then just simply pass it through the House through this hotlining process.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.640]   Now, if, so this would only work if no senators object to it under the idea of unanimous consent.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   If any senators object to the House version of the bill, then it has to go on hold and it has
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.880]   to be debated and further changes brought in in some way. At the moment, it seems as though
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.480]   one senator is publicly causing problems for this bill, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.400]   evidently, according to news reports, objects to the bill and objects to the fact that in the final
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   version of the House bill, some provisions that would allow 529 educational savings account funds
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.680]   to be used to pay for homeschooling expenses were removed and also some other idea for uses of 529
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.520]   funds as well. It's possible that there are other senators objecting as well because holds can be
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.360]   placed on the legislation anonymously. So that's where things are in terms of a legislative process.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.800]   We simply don't know if this bill will become law. We don't know if the US Senate will pass it. We
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.000]   don't know if the president will sign it. So from that perspective, I am a little bit premature
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.720]   in talking about it. However, I want to use this because I think it's an important example of just
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.320]   how quickly things can change when your plans are reliant upon laws, legislation, and policy
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   of the government, especially as it relates to taxation. What is in H.R. 1994? What does it
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.800]   actually say? Well, there are a bunch of different provisions in this legislation. Here I'm just
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.680]   going to go with the House legislation and discuss that because that's what's actually been passed.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.800]   These provisions in the legislation range from fairly small to very industry-specific to some
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.680]   very big things that will affect mainstream financial planning. There are a number of just
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.960]   very small specialty issues in this bill, and then there are a number of things that are more
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.000]   on the corporate side of the financial planning space, some changes of different plans that can
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.400]   be offered and things like that. But there are some provisions in this legislation that would
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.240]   make a big, big deal, that would make a big, big change in terms of average financial planning.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   Now the changes in 529 plans are one of those examples. Over the years, 529 plans have become
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.480]   increasingly attractive. I have here on Radical Personal Finance talked about why 529 plans are
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.360]   so attractive. I've tried to disabuse you of the idea that 529 plans are a great tool in the way
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.560]   that they're often used by parents saving for their child's college. I've tried to show how
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.240]   the potential tax savings are relatively modest for a so-called stereotypical average family who
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   is putting $100 a month into a college fund starting when the child is 10 years old and
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.080]   is planning to take it out at 18 years old. And I've tried to show how the savings in that type
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.720]   of plan are very, very modest. However, 529 plans are very useful because they can be front-loaded
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.840]   with lots of money. They are protected from the claims of creditors, and so that can be very useful
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.080]   in terms of a simple asset protection plan. They're very, very useful from an estate planning
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.520]   perspective because they are considered to be a gift for estate tax planning purposes. They're a
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.560]   completed gift where you're actually making a transfer into the account for your child,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.720]   thus removing funds from your estate. But you still have the opportunity to change the
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.040]   beneficiaries to control the account. There's a high degree of control available for you
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.920]   in establishing one of these accounts. And so I've tried to show how they actually can be very useful
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.240]   for many people. Just I don't love them in their mainstream application. I love them in some of
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   the more radical applications. Now, a couple of years ago, 529 plans became much more attractive
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   because now the use of 529 plans has been expanded from K through 12. I guess this was last year,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.360]   I think, from K through 12 private school education. So now you can use these to fund
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.800]   not only college expenses, but appropriate K through 12 private education. That's a big,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.360]   big deal, and it really enhances the usability of a 529 plan because many families, especially
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.560]   many families, would like to save for their children's college, but they're also going to
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.160]   be committed to making payments for private school tuition along the way. And a 529 plan
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   allows you to set aside the money for those payments to use it in a tax efficient way and
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.640]   to fund those K through 12 expenses. Now, again, there could be some tax savings, but the tax
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.360]   savings will work out best if you have a very young child and you're using the money and you
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.880]   can get a lot of gain. I don't think the tax savings are the number one reason to use a 529
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.440]   plan. I think it's useful, but it would work if you have a very young child and you're planning
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.400]   for college. But if you're planning for a five-year-old's expenses at age 10, five years of
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:49.040]   earnings on an investment is likely not to be so, so significant. But it can be there. Not denying
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.000]   it can be a factor, just that it's not the number one factor. In my mind, this K through 12 opens up
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.240]   a tremendous possibility for wealthy parents, wealthy grandparents to fund an expense that
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   they're committed to, often high-priced private school tuition, and to do it in a way that is
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.840]   very flexible and allows them to protect the funds that they have from the claims of creditors.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.120]   So this is what I really love about 529 plans. Parents, grandparents can put 50 grand, 100 grand
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   into an account, set it aside. It's not inside of a trust, but it is protected from the attacks of
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   creditors and they can fund that educational expense and they can do that from K through 12.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.880]   And in my opinion, it's far more important to heavily fund an excellent primary school and
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   secondary school education than it is to fund a college education. Any student who is bright and
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:50.080]   who is capable academically can fund their own college education with just working at McDonald's.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   And then there's massive amounts of money available for any student who is good at academics,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   available to pay for them to go to college. Many students can get paid to go to college.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.680]   But that's not the same way for K through 6 expenses or 6 through 12 expenses. Those are
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.080]   the years where there simply aren't many scholarships available. The student obviously
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.560]   can't pay for it themselves. I don't mind expecting an 18-year-old to pay for their
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.080]   own college education. But even as much of a radical as I am, I don't expect a 6-year-old
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.600]   to pay for their private school education. That's obviously unreasonable. So it's much
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.920]   more valuable for, in my opinion, if a parent had to choose between prioritizing educational
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.520]   funds for college versus prioritizing educational funds for first grade, second grade, third grade,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.000]   fifth grade, I would rather they prioritize those funds for first, second, and third and
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   let the child deal with college on their own. The reason most people don't think this, of course,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.120]   is because of the fact that you don't have to pay out of pocket to put your child into a government
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.680]   school. There's no out-of-pocket expense for that. And so most people don't think of paying for
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.600]   K through 12 primary and secondary school education. They think of paying for college
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.400]   because the number of government colleges that is available without tuition is rising, but is still
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.480]   almost non-existent compared to the number of K through 12 government schools that can be had
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.840]   without paying tuition. But if you put your child in a government school, you get general government
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.040]   school results generally, which on the whole are not particularly good. So I would rather see those
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.320]   dollars prioritized through K through 12 than it through college, just from an analytical perspective.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.960]   If you have to choose between them, it makes more sense to me to prioritize it in the early years.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.120]   And now that the 529 plans are opened up to that, that's a big, big deal. It makes them very, very
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.000]   useful. So I've grown over the last three to four years to think much more highly of 529 plans than
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.360]   I did previously. There are good investments available, low-cost investments. You can use
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.000]   the state that best serves your situation. A small number of US Americans will get some defray of
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.240]   their state-level income taxes with the 529 plan. So that can be helpful as well. Now, the thing
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.480]   that 529 plans haven't covered thus far is homeschool expenses. And if they did cover homeschool
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   expenses, I would now become probably one of the biggest cheerleaders because, of course, I think
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.560]   that dollars go much farther in homeschooling or some kind of looser educational system that doesn't
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.680]   just follow the factory school model. But unfortunately, thus far, it's not the case.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.960]   Now, will this legislation change that? Maybe. Time will tell. At the moment, I don't expect it
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.720]   to. In general, when you start talking about homeschooling in any way, you have to go up
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   against the teachers' unions and the government school cartel. And in general, they are very,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.240]   very powerful, especially politically. And that's my understanding of what happened with the House
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:55.360]   Bill. The previous House Bill did have provisions in it that allowed for 529 accounts to be used to
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.960]   pay for homeschool expenses for K-12 students. And then at the last minute, due to the pressure
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.560]   from the teachers' unions, the House of Representatives pulled that provision.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.360]   Will it come back? I doubt it. But time will tell. That was a bit of a discourse on 529 plans,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   but it's not the main focus as far as the biggest threat of what this legislation would be for a
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:25.760]   broader audience. There are other benefits in the HR 1994 legislation, and some of these other
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.920]   benefits of the HR 1994 legislation are actually quite interesting and useful. So, for example,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.640]   there is a provision that would allow penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans for individuals
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.280]   in case of the birth of a child or adoption. I like that. I'm happy to have those provisions
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:51.440]   if they are in the final legislation as it is passed. One bit of change in the law is some
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.080]   change in the rules, where there's an increase in age for required beginning date for mandatory
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.880]   distributions. That's only modest. I think it goes from 70.5 to 72. But a bigger issue for me
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.760]   is there would be a repeal of the maximum age for traditional IRA contributions. That's useful to me
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.520]   as well. But there are some downsides. Let's get to the number one biggest threat here with this
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.240]   particular legislation. And that is the change of what we in the financial planning business call
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:30.160]   a stretch IRA. The change in rules that would basically eliminate the usefulness of a stretch
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.360]   IRA. First, let's explain how the law is right now so you can understand the benefits of a stretch
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.880]   IRA. And then we'll talk about how utterly destructive this legislation is to this particular
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:48.480]   strategy. As things stand right now, if you are the owner of an IRA, and that IRA can be a
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.160]   traditional IRA or that IRA can be a Roth IRA, then you have certain rules that govern you,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.360]   and then you have certain rules that govern the beneficiary of that account in the case of
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:08.880]   your death. Now, if you own a Roth IRA, then because you have already paid the income taxes
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:16.000]   on the account, the way things stand right now, you can own that account for your entire lifetime,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.440]   and there are no required distributions from the account. So the account can continue to
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.080]   accrue and grow throughout your entire lifetime until your death. If you own a traditional IRA,
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.560]   you can own that account through your death, but starting at the age of 70 and a half,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.440]   you're required to make certain distributions from the account. Those are called required
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.360]   minimum distributions. And they come out because you fund a traditional IRA with money that you
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.800]   haven't paid income taxes on yet. There's a formula that makes the money come out that you
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.040]   calculate to decide how much needs to be distributed, and that formula is based on
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.920]   your life expectancy. So when you are 70 and a half, it's a small percentage of the account.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.160]   When you are 90 and a half, it's a larger percentage of the account. So increasingly,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.040]   more and more money comes out of the account. Now, for many people who have a small amount of money
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.040]   in an IRA or a Roth IRA, these rules are relatively immaterial. They want to take the
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.320]   money out and spend it on retirement. That's their basic idea that they, that's why they
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.760]   invested. And they don't have enough money to have a lot left over when they're dead.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.200]   They're just focusing on having the money and using it to pay for retirement. So most of these
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.080]   changes or even changes in rules would be relatively immaterial. However, for the radical
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.920]   personal finance audience, we're not the normal person. Rather, we're looking to exploit the rules
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.520]   and say, "Can we, following the law, get major, major benefits that are not available to other
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.920]   people?" And for those, it are not available if we just use up all the money. And in those contexts,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.720]   a tool like a Roth IRA can be an extremely powerful tool. If you can set aside a stash of cash
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.040]   and then leave it alone for a long period of time, it can grow to be a huge asset for your
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   beneficiaries as part of your estate. Let me give an example of how reasonably this can be done.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.440]   Let's assume that a 50-year-old can successfully save and accumulate $50,000 in a Roth IRA.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.720]   So we're going to begin with a present value of $50,000. And let's assume that that 50-year-old
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.160]   doesn't need this particular account to pay for their own retirement expenses, such as they are.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.440]   So they can keep this money invested in this account. Let's further assume that this 50-year-old
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:42.400]   is able to live to a total of, let's say he was 95, to age 95, for 45 years of total lifespan.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.760]   So that gives us 45 years of investing. And assuming that this 50-year-old can invest and
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.520]   earn, say, an 8% rate of return, this one account of $50,000, because it has 45 years available for
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:03.760]   it, can become worth $1.6 million at their date of death. If they could earn a 10% rate of return,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:11.120]   it could be potentially $3.6 million. So there's major value in a 50-year-old accumulating this
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:18.720]   and setting it aside as a primary asset for their children. One of the best assets we
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.080]   traditionally teach in good financial planning, we traditionally teach that one of the best assets
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   for you to leave to your children is a Roth IRA. And that's because of the rules of what can happen
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:35.920]   when you die and you leave it behind for your children. Now, let's assume for a moment that
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.240]   you leave this asset to your child, or even better, we could do a grandchild or your grandchild,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.080]   and they inherit it at your death. What can that person do with this Roth IRA? Well, the first
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.600]   thing they can do is they can obviously just take the money and they can spend it. They can just
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.280]   cash it all out. And if it's in a Roth IRA account, let's say they inherited $1.5 million,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.360]   there would be no taxes due on the money. They can just simply take the money and spend it. It's a
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.000]   Roth IRA, the taxes have already been paid, now they can take the full distribution out and do
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.160]   whatever they want. If it is a traditional IRA, then they can take the full amount out, the $1.5
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.280]   million, but they would owe taxes on $1.5 million of income. So you can see here why the Roth IRA
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.240]   can be really superior. But what else can they do? Well, they can take required minimum distributions
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.440]   over a couple different options of person's life expectancy. So they could take it off of your life
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.640]   expectancy, but if you're leaving it to a child, they can take the required minimum distributions
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:46.000]   out on their own life expectancy. So if you left this behind for a 10-year-old or a 15-year-old
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   or a 20-year-old, you can imagine how low the required minimum distributions are from this
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.400]   account. Now, if you have $1.5 million that's tax-free, and you leave it behind as an asset
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.760]   for a young person, that $1.5 million can basically become a trust fund that provides an income,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:13.200]   a lifelong income for the young person, and in many ways could provide for the retirement security
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.480]   of that person. And the rules around these types of accounts, I'm focusing on a Roth IRA because
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.440]   it's superior here to a traditional IRA, but the rules are applicable to both. The rules on a Roth
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:32.480]   IRA are so fantastic that they're wonderful. It's a wonderful asset to leave behind. First,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.720]   you can fund a Roth IRA with just about any investment that you want. There are a few
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.640]   prohibited investments. You can't own life insurance in it. There are a couple other
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   prohibited rules, but you can pretty much fund a Roth IRA with just about anything.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.160]   So you can put a house inside of a Roth IRA. You can put a stock inside of a Roth IRA. You can put
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.240]   a mutual fund or an ETF inside of a Roth IRA. You can even put gold coins inside of a Roth IRA. You
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:03.280]   can put almost any type of investment inside of a Roth IRA. So this opens up a tremendous range of
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.480]   opportunities to you. Another thing you can do, though, is because of the Roth IRA being
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.080]   generally protected from the claims of creditors, you have a very safe asset that's available
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:21.840]   to leave behind. So similar to what would happen if you set up a formal trust for your child or
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   grandchildren, the Roth IRA has many protections. It's protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:33.840]   Your child could have a million and a half dollars in their inherited IRA, but as long as
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.520]   the money stays in that inherited IRA, it should, in most states, retain its protected status as
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.480]   being exempt from the claims of creditors. It should be an asset that can be segregated out
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.040]   in case of a divorce or other life happening that causes the child's assets to be exposed to the
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.320]   claims of creditors or other people. And so it's a very, very safe asset. But because it's a Roth
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.520]   IRA, it's eminently simple. You don't have to pay a trustee for management fees. You just pay
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.520]   a simple custodian, and the costs on these are basically non-existent. And so it's a wonderfully
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.440]   efficient asset. And if you just think, I mean, I hesitate to even do the math, but if you just
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:21.360]   think of how much money this can grow to if you leave it behind to a young person, and the money
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.080]   is exempt from taxes and it can come out on the young person's life expectancy over an 80-year
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:33.760]   period, it can be an absolutely huge asset. So given that this is so good, this has become a
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.520]   primary staple of financial planning advice. I've gone on and on about all these benefits here just
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:47.040]   now. And this is a major, major benefit of a Roth IRA. And it causes most people like me,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.480]   financial planners like me, to use these as a primary tool. And you should. But now watch what
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:00.160]   happens if this new legislation passes. What happens if the SECURE Act becomes law and passes
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:11.360]   the Senate by unanimous consent? The SECURE Act eliminates the stretch IRA. The SECURE Act
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   eliminates the stretch IRA. As things stand right now, the beneficiary of an account can stretch
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:27.040]   things out over their actuarial lifetime, which is really wonderful. But under the terms of the
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:37.440]   SECURE Act, a non-spouse beneficiary of an IRA has 10 years to pull out all the money inside of an
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.200]   IRA. Now here's where we're going to kind of slide to the side and morph over into talking about
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:52.320]   traditional IRAs instead of so much Roth IRAs. Because from a tax perspective, the impact here
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:59.360]   to a Roth IRA is not so substantial as the impact to a traditional IRA. The reason is that when the
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   assets come out of the Roth IRA, they're going to come out tax-free. So yes, you don't get to
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   maintain the tax deferral over a long period of time. You just have to take the money out. It's
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.640]   basically going to be kicked out and you have to spend it. So, okay, big deal. But what about the
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.400]   tax planning for a traditional IRA? And here, focus very carefully on the fact that this is
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   applicable to a 401(k), traditional 401(k), 403(b), etc. All types of traditional accounts. And the
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   vast majority of savings are not in Roth IRAs, but in these types of traditional accounts.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:43.200]   So imagine here that a parent, let's say that I set aside and put $20,000 per year into a 401(k)
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   and then I happen to die at 50 years old and I've accumulated half a million dollars in my 401(k).
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:59.040]   Now, this is a very normal scenario for people who are in the upper, the top half of median income
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.120]   earners who are contributing to retirement accounts, etc. It's not normal. Most people below
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.480]   the median income earners don't have retirement savings, etc. But it's normal for the audience
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:15.040]   of radical personal finance to put aside $20,000 per year into a 401(k). Well, in this situation now,
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:22.000]   my wife could inherit the money, but if I leave the money to my child, now my child has 10 years
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.160]   to get the money out of the IRA. Now, let's assume that you are a child and you inherit $500,000
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:35.120]   in an IRA. And let's assume now that you have 10 years to get the money out.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:43.200]   You do the math and you can see how big of a deal this is going to be from an income
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:50.080]   tax perspective. Let's assume for a moment that I die and I leave an 18-year-old child
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.160]   behind. My 18-year-old child inherits my half-million-dollar IRA that was my work 401(k).
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.000]   Now that 18-year-old child has $50,000 of income coming in, if they're going to take it out in
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.640]   equal payments for the next 10 years, $50,000 per year, I have just destroyed any ability of my
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:19.680]   child to qualify for scholarships. I've just destroyed any ability of my child to get financial
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:31.600]   aid, student loans, major changes now because my child has $50,000 of income. Or what if it were
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:38.080]   more? What if I left behind a million-dollar 401(k) and now it's $100,000 per year and now my
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:49.760]   child has $100,000 of income coming in on top of their salary? You can quickly see how under the
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.040]   progressive tax system of the United States, a major, major portion of that account would be
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:02.560]   lost to income taxes. Now first, let's talk about is this fair, right? Is this just? Well,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.640]   I understand the arguments that would be in favor. For example, let's say we can cry big tears for my
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.080]   college student who can no longer qualify for financial aid and who can no longer qualify for
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.280]   scholarships because I have $50,000 of income and say, "Look, they have $50,000 of income. They
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.040]   should pay for their own school." Okay, that's a fair point. I don't think that's wrong.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   I don't know in this situation that we can make an argument one way or the other. We can start at
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.960]   the basis of should there be taxation at all? That's a fair argument. But I think in this
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.600]   situation, you can understand why the people voting for this legislation would certainly say,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.640]   "Well, big deal. So what? A rich person has millions of dollars in their IRA and so what?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.800]   Their kid has to pay taxes." Fine. You can understand how they would do that, which is why
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.000]   this legislation passed 417 to 3 in the House of Representatives and there's a decent chance that
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.120]   it'll pass unanimously in the Senate. Time will tell. So you can understand why the proponents
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:11.840]   of this would try to make these changes. But as far as I'm concerned, this is a good example of how
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:17.680]   governments default on their promises by changing the law.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.360]   That basically when you're dealing with government, you're not dealing with a person
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.480]   who can be held accountable to fulfill their word, to fulfill a contract as agreed upon.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Rather, you're dealing with an entity that can be moved by the winds of the day.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.240]   So if you and I made an agreement and you and I made a contract and I said, "I will allow you to
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.480]   do this and you'll get these benefits," then you would expect those benefits to continue.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.960]   But when you're dealing with government, you don't have that. You don't have a contract.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.560]   They didn't give you a contract when you participated in their IRA scheme.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.280]   They just simply said, "Hey, do this and you'll have it," and then they changed the law.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.160]   And this is why I really wanted to bring this subject out. Because everything,
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.880]   every kind of government program, every kind of government scheme, every kind of government tax
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.800]   law, all of these are run by the same basic concept. There is very little stability or
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.120]   consistency to this. It has more to where you can say that this is the way it's going to be,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.440]   has much more to do with where are the tides turning at the moment.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.280]   So the laws on IRAs changing, this is not changed, this is changed all the time.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.040]   They have changed again and again. Sometimes they change for our benefit. Sometimes they change
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:42.640]   against us. But we don't have any choice, any control over their changing. The moral of the
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:50.560]   story is that you need to assume any time you're making decisions that involve government legislation,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:57.680]   government rules, you need to assume that you're dealing with a fickle partner that can basically
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   at any time with a little bit of advance warning due to legislative process change all the rules
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:11.600]   completely and completely destroy what you're trying to do. Now, does this mean that a Roth
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.360]   IRA is a terrible deal or a traditional IRA is a terrible deal? I don't think it's a terrible deal,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:25.120]   no. But if your strategy is 100% predicated on this one thing going, if your counterparty is
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.600]   the government, is the US federal government, you cannot trust them. You cannot trust them
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.840]   not to change the rules. Why am I bringing this out? Well, there is an important question that
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.800]   needs to be asked. Any time you deal with a governmental entity, can we trust them to keep
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.280]   things the way they are? And in personal finance discussions, there is a broad range of trust.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.200]   There's a broad range of confidence that different people have. And I've thought through this
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.800]   question and been exposed to the different extremes that, and I've never quite known how to
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.120]   work it and to find the answer that I could put my own feet on. For example, there are people who
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.800]   will give you the advice and say, "You should always participate in a program like IRAs, 401ks,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:18.240]   et cetera, because they're the very best thing and you'll save tons and tons of money. You should
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.720]   always fund your 401k first. You should always fund your Roth IRA first because it'll save you
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.280]   tons of tax money." That's the mainstream financial planning line of argumentation.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.880]   From a mathematical perspective, it's really hard to argue with that. And you look at it and you
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.840]   say, "Yeah, these can be compelling benefits." I've tried to show you how compelling a Roth IRA
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.040]   can be. I didn't go into too many details, but as far as calculating the tax consequence, but
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.400]   these are compelling benefits. But on the flip side then, there's a more extreme, usually a
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.120]   fringe group in today's world where people say, "You should never participate in an IRA. You
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.360]   should never participate in a 401k because the government's just going to tax that money anyway."
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.960]   Well, are they right? I don't know. I have a very hard time seeing the support for that fringe view.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.320]   And the reason I say that is because I think that once these programs get so established,
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:27.360]   I think there would be an outcry if, for example, if today the US federal government started to
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:36.000]   impose a new tax on Roth IRAs, I think there would be enough of a voter outcry to stop that. I do.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.560]   Now, can I prove it? I can't prove it. But I think enough people have Roth IRAs and enough people
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.920]   would feel like they were being tricked, that there would be enough of an outcry that the
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.280]   politicians would scurry away and not change the rules. But I can't say that that's going to be
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.080]   the same way forever. And that's where I've always struggled with that extreme fringe view, where I
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.920]   say, "You know, I don't trust the government either, but it seems like I've got to make a
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.160]   test here of the political will." So it's important now to look at legislation like this. This
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:13.840]   legislation, if it passes, dramatically, dramatically devalues retirement accounts.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:22.160]   It makes a huge, huge devaluing in retirement accounts. And it can very substantially point
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.400]   us in a totally different direction. For example, if this legislation becomes a law,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   then now we're going to, I would seriously look at my investments and I would much rather leave
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.880]   investments. So I would much rather leave an investment that's a capital gain asset that can
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.840]   receive a step up in tax basis at my death and thus be inherited income tax free by my children,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.600]   or at least with a massive step up in tax basis, then leave an account filled with untaxed ordinary
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.960]   income, which is what happens in a 401k. In this situation now, I would go back and I would say,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.800]   "Man, I would much rather not participate in this 401k here. I'd much rather buy a piece of real
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.480]   estate or buy a stock or buy a business or some kind of capital gain asset and leave that asset
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.440]   just outright, not in any kind of qualified account to my child, maybe protect it by a trust
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.880]   instead of a qualified plan document." That's going to be a much superior tax strategy than
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:31.040]   the 401k. If this legislation changes, the value of your retirement account is dropped by,
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:41.760]   what number to use? I mean, 20%, 10%. I don't know exactly how to defend a specific number,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.720]   but there's a massive drop in value here from your retirement account if this new legislation passes.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.960]   So what do you do? How do you do? What do you do practically? Well, here's how I think about this.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.200]   I'm uncomfortable with either of those extreme positions that I outlined.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:07.840]   For example, I'm uncomfortable with the mainstream financial planning advice that just says,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:15.200]   "Always prioritize retirement accounts," because I think they don't account for the embedded risk
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:23.680]   of dealing with a fundamentally uncontrollable entity such as a government where you cannot
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.760]   exert any control. You can't sue them in court because of a breach of contract. We're dealing
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.240]   in a world where, hey, the legislators said this, they were duly elected by their representatives,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:39.360]   and so you're basically dealing with a fickle group of people that is going to be representative
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.080]   of the winds of the day. Now, thankfully, in the US-American system, there's a bit of a stabilizing
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.360]   influence. You have a house of representatives that is deeply responsive to the passions of the
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.440]   day. You have the US Senate, which is not responsive to the passions of the day, but is
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.080]   intended to be much slower, to make everything slow down. And you see that happening right now
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.400]   with this particular legislation. Time will tell what happens. So thankfully, there is, at least in
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.360]   the United States of America, a moderating influence due to the system of government that was
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.480]   imposed. But at the end of the day, you're still dealing with a government that views itself as
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.920]   sovereign, that views itself as the owner of your money, and views itself to have the authority to
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.680]   tax you on your money and to imprison you if you don't pay them their tribute. And so it's
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   fundamentally, I think, dangerous to take the mainstream position and say, "Well, it's just,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.000]   this is what they have, so I'll just participate fully in this program." But on the flip side,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.480]   to totally walk away, although I understand and respect the commitment of people who do that,
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:49.680]   to totally walk away, I think, denies some of the practical value of these types of accounts.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.440]   For example, I've emphasized in this show and in many shows, one of the most practical values
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:01.760]   of retirement accounts is not the tax savings, but the simple protection from creditors. No,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.880]   they don't defend you against super creditors, such as tax obligations, such as court judgments,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.160]   such as court restitution, etc. But they do protect you against the common ordinary credit,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.360]   ordinary everyday creditors. And so these accounts are very, very powerful. For an average person,
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.760]   there is almost no better creditor protection scheme that can be engaged in than just putting
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.120]   money in a 401k account, putting money in a Roth IRA. These accounts have a huge degree of
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.280]   flexibility, and they can be leveraged by a thoughtful person. And although the legislation
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.240]   will change, I think there is enough of an advance notice that a thoughtful person who's paying
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:47.280]   attention can see the writing on the wall. For example, it does seem excessive to expect that
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.760]   Roth IRAs will continue in the way that they have been established. When the Roth IRA was first
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.240]   established, it was supposed to be a very small account. It was supposed to be a small account.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.320]   But the government just doesn't give away tax-free growth and tax-free buildup for decades without
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:12.400]   it. It fundamentally belies the taxing nature of a government entity to say, "We're going to give
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.320]   you this account that you can build up millions and millions of dollars." So then Roth IRAs
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.880]   started to be used, and then they started to be exploited by thoughtful, intelligent people.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:27.760]   You started to have rollovers. You started to have the backdoor Roth IRA develop. So far,
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.960]   thus far, the backdoor Roth IRA is still legal. But you're in a situation now where people can
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.480]   accumulate millions and millions and millions of dollars in a Roth IRA. And anytime something is
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:48.240]   exploited like that, it now becomes a target. And this is not new. Back in 2015, President Obama
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:55.120]   proposed several changes to the retirement legislation. President Obama in 2015
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:02.080]   proposed a budget that would impose required minimum distributions for Roth IRAs. He also,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:09.280]   in 2015, proposed a cap on the amount of money that you could accumulate inside of an IRA,
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:16.000]   and other changes as well. So I don't feel that either of those extreme positions of, "I'm just
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.840]   not going to participate," although I understand that, or "I'm going to be all in," although I
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.960]   understand that as well, I don't think those are the right position. Here's what I think is the
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:34.400]   practical right position. We only have the rules and laws that we have today. And if we're going
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:42.080]   to abide by the law, which I think is important, it's morally right, and it's practically necessary,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.760]   again, don't mess around with people who will put you in jail and execute you.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.360]   Follow their rules, no matter how stupid they are, because when somebody will put you in jail
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.600]   and execute you, that will cause us to... Loses your freedom, and that kind of eliminates the
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   whole idea. So we follow the law very, very carefully, and make sure that everything we do
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.440]   is law-abiding. If we don't want to follow the law, the practical way is to remove yourself
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:16.480]   from the laws that you don't like. So if the government imposes... If the US government bans
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:24.720]   alcohol, the most practical course of action is not to become a rum runner. You might be put in
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.080]   prison for that and executed. The most practical option is just move to a place where the government
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:37.040]   doesn't ban alcohol. Then you can maintain your freedom, and you can... It's just much more
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.640]   practical. So we follow the law. We follow the law very carefully, and especially in tax situations
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.000]   where, again, they will put you in prison for life if you don't play by their rules.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:59.200]   But be practical and thoughtful, and never risk your entire plan on what the person says
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:06.240]   they will do. Just like in any kind of practical business dealing, you don't risk everything on
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.680]   what somebody says they will do, especially when you're dealing with a fickle and corrupt entity
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   such as a national government. So use the laws that are advantageous to you. Use a Roth IRA,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:25.840]   use a 401k, etc. But if you get to the point where your entire wealth is dependent upon this one rule
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:33.760]   staying in force, now I think you've got a risk that can't be trusted. Now I think you've got
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.200]   something that you need to adjust. And so keep that diversity there in your plan.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.960]   There have been a number of changes proposed to the HR 1994 and a number of different
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:52.240]   kind of caveats to the legislation. For example, oftentimes when you see rules change like this,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.400]   you'll see a certain cap. They'll say, "Well, we're going to cap IRAs that are more than a
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.880]   million dollars, and we're going to tax you on the excess," or things like that. It's a common way.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.960]   And that fits in with the general ethic that you see applied by legislators. The basic idea is
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.800]   soak the rich and take care of the poor people. So we're going to give this, but we're not going
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   to give it to the rich people. So you can play within those things. Make sure that your accounts
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:24.240]   never look like they're all that rich. Make sure that you... I don't want to give too many examples,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.560]   but you just play by the rules and don't ever make yourself look like a big fish.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.120]   There are ways around it, and there are always going to be ways around it. But my point here
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:40.240]   is don't bet the farm. Don't focus everything on just one account or one strategy. Diversification
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.520]   is important in more than just making sure you don't own one stock. Diversification is important
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.160]   in strategy because when you have multiple accounts, you have different things that you
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.200]   can draw on. This is kind of classic retirement distribution planning 101. If you have an account
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:01.600]   that is a tax-deferred account, if you have like a 401(k), if you have an account that's a tax-free
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:10.000]   account like a Roth IRA, if you have an asset like stocks that have some capital gains or throw
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.400]   off some income that are outside of qualified plans, if you have some assets that can be sold
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.120]   when you need money, if you have access to life insurance, cash values that can be accessed from
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.440]   time to time, if you have access to lines of credit, then now an intelligent financial advisor
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.600]   can sit down, bring together those different assets, look at the tax code at the time,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.800]   which none of us can predict, and then put together a distribution strategy that maximizes
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   the benefits of each of those things. So diversify. Diversify your plans. Diversify your strategies.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:48.640]   There are other good things about HR 1994 if it is passed the SECURE Act. There are benefits and
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:56.000]   disadvantages. I don't love the insurance industry is lobbying very hard to get the annuity laws
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.600]   passed. I don't love it. Time will tell. I don't want to talk more about things because it could
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:11.280]   be made totally irrelevant when we see final legislation, if any has ever passed. The basic
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:16.800]   thing I wanted to use is to say it's not crazy to think that the laws will change. The laws will
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:23.360]   change. It's crazy to think that things will just continue as they always are. But that doesn't
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   mean that you have to take that hardcore position of "I'm just never going to have a retirement
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:34.960]   account." Yes, taxes will go up. In my opinion, this is a perfect example of government default.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   This is what we can expect example after example after example after example of in the coming
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   decades. The US federal government is bankrupt. They're desperately looking for money. They're
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:53.440]   running almost trillion dollar deficit every single year. How do you fix that? Well, you raise taxes
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.360]   and you lower benefits. How do you do that in a way that doesn't count for a political revolt?
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.440]   You do it in little bits. You raise taxes in ways that don't force a legislator to stand up in front
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.920]   of people and say, "Yes, I raised your taxes." You do it in back doorways like this. And then you
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.440]   raise it at the margin and you do it on people and you say, "Listen, who needs $5 million in an IRA?
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.720]   Of course you don't need that. And hey, these accounts were never designed to have this provision
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.520]   where you could leave it to your kids and have it tax-free for 60 years or 50 years. These accounts
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.520]   were never designed for that. So all we're doing is just closing a loophole." Never mind that they
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:36.000]   wrote the law that way. It was exactly what they did. They did it to incentivize people to
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.200]   participate in those accounts and then they changed the law. So the way that this is happening
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.960]   and is something that we can see again and again and again in the coming decades,
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.880]   or at least that's my guess on what will happen in the future. You judge for yourself.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.840]   I think that's the major point I wanted to communicate in this show. My intent is not
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:02.160]   that you worry about HR 1994. It will impact you if you've got a huge balance in your qualified
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:08.640]   plans or in your Roth IRA accounts. But it's not going to be a specific negative harm to you right
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.920]   now. It just means that the great plan, if this passes, the great plan that you thought was going
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.720]   to be in place just isn't going to work out as well as you thought. But there will always be
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.880]   ways around it. You can remember this. What's the phrase that I think Jeff Schnepper loves?
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.320]   "Where there's a will, there's a lawyer." And it's a lot better and more profitable for you to spend
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.360]   your money on lawyers and financial advisors than to spend it on paying taxes. At least if you
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.200]   spend it on your lawyer and you make his Porsche payment for him, you at least are stimulating the
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:45.680]   economy and helping him and everyone that makes the Porsche. You're actually helping people instead
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.920]   of sending it off to make guns and bombs to control the world. So there's always a way through it,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   and you'll find it. Keep an eye on HR 1994. We'll see what happens. I would love it if the 529
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.440]   provisions were expanded for homeschooling. That would thrill me. But in general, almost none of
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.080]   us are ever happy. Probably any decent piece of legislation never makes everybody happy. It's
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.560]   always winners and losers. And that's probably, in the end, fair that it works out that way.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.960]   So we'll deal with it as it comes along. But watch it. Watch the process, because I think it's
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.320]   instructive. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Don't bet the farm. And I wish I could come up
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.640]   with another list of cliches to show that there's wisdom in diversifying. Don't bet everything on
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:35.920]   one strategy. If your entire strategy is the backdoor Roth IRA, it's not dead. It just might
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:45.440]   be very well diminished in benefit in the next few weeks or months. Sweet Hop is an online
