[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.800]   - What kind of questions can science not currently answer,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.820]   but might soon?
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.760]   When you think about the problems and the mysteries
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   before us, that may be within reach of science.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240]   - I think an obvious one is the origin of life.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.840]   We don't know how that happened.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.240]   There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.200]   actually, literally on earth,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.460]   but starting life from non-life is something
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.360]   I kind of think we're close to, right?
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.000]   We're really-- - You really think so?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.720]   How difficult is it to start life?
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.100]   - Well, I've talked to people,
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.900]   including on the podcast about this.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.320]   Life requires three things.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.200]   Life as we know it.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.480]   So there's a difference with life,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.120]   which who knows what it is,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.080]   and life as we know it,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.760]   which we can talk about with some intelligence.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.800]   So life as we know it requires compartmentalization.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.600]   You need like a little membrane around your cell.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.920]   Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.000]   and let that make you do things.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.560]   And then replication, okay?
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   So you need to have some information about who you are
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.840]   that you pass down to future generations.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.720]   In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   not hard to make lipid bilayers
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   that come into little cellular walls pretty easily.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.220]   Metabolism and replication are hard,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.880]   but replication we're close to.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.920]   People have made RNA-like molecules in the lab
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.800]   that I think the state of the art is
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   they're not able to make one molecule
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.020]   that reproduces itself,
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.560]   but they're able to make two molecules
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   that reproduce each other.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.080]   So that's okay, that's pretty close.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.000]   Metabolism is harder, believe it or not,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.860]   even though it's sort of the most obvious thing,
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.920]   but you want some sort of controlled metabolism.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.480]   And the actual cellular machinery in our bodies
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.680]   is quite complicated.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.920]   It's hard to see it just popping into existence
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.760]   all by itself.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.720]   It probably took a while,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.080]   but we're making progress.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.240]   And in fact, I don't think we're spending
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.560]   nearly enough money on it.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.780]   If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.200]   'cause it would change our view of the world
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.760]   if we could actually make life in the lab
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.560]   and understand how it was made originally here on Earth.
