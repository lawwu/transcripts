[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   It's a great question, and we get it a lot.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.260]   Can I only be saved if I comprehend the Trinity?
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.520]   And if so, how much of the Trinity must make sense to me?
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.420]   The complexity of our triune God, of course, leads to this question from many listeners,
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.800]   including one named Paul.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.320]   "Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.400]   What happens to the people who trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ but do not have
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.920]   a clear grasp of the Trinity?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   Are they saved?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960]   What degree of clarity in this life must one reach about the Trinity to affirm one's true
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.400]   understanding of and trust in the God of the Bible?"
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to him and to the many others asking this same question?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.260]   First, let's provide, because I think this is just a golden opportunity for help to lots
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.600]   of folks who believe it and are not sure what they believe.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.800]   So I want to take the opportunity to provide a brief introduction to the biblical teaching
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.760]   that God exists as Father, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.160]   of them a person, each of them God, but each of them comprising one divine essence, one
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   God, not three gods.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   When Jesus was asked, "Which is the most important commandment?"
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   He began his answer in Mark 12 29 by reaffirming the ancient Jewish belief in monotheism, one
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.420]   God, monotheism.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:54.200]   From Deuteronomy 6 4, he said, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.420]   Those are the words of Jesus quoting Deuteronomy.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.860]   So Christians are not, nor ever have been, polytheists.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.300]   We don't believe in multiple gods, like the ancient Greeks had their pantheon of gods.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.180]   We're not like that.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.600]   As Jesus comes into the world, we have this revelation from him and from his apostles
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.820]   that goes like this.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:34.780]   John 1 verse 1, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.980]   was God."
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860]   Amazing.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.140]   With God and was God.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.300]   Verse 14, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.740]   as of the only Son."
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.060]   So the word "Word" changes to "Son."
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.340]   Now we know we're talking about a divine Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.380]   And then he gets a name in verse 17, "This grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.020]   Oh my goodness, those are important words.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.860]   So from the beginning, there was God, and there was the Word who became flesh in Jesus
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   Christ.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.180]   And from the beginning, that Word was God, and the Word was with God.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:36.740]   So Jesus Christ is the God-man, God in flesh, the one who was God and came into flesh.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.780]   And though he was God from all eternity, he was also with God from all eternity.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.900]   Now these are the kinds of texts from which is built the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.060]   We have God the Father, and we call him that, the Father, because in chapter 1 verse 14,
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.260]   it says that the Word became flesh as the Son from the Father.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.980]   And we have the Word co-eternal with the Father, who is called the Son.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.580]   So right here in John 1 verses 1 to 17, we have God the Father and God the Son, one God
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.820]   in two persons.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.740]   Then we have the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.820]   And the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God, Matthew 3.16.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.260]   The Spirit of God was descending on him like a dove, and he's called the Spirit of God's
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.140]   Son, Galatians 4.6.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:55.460]   So if the Spirit is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit is the Spirit of the Son of God,
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:04.660]   and if God is God and the Son is God, then the Spirit is God, if the Spirit is a distinct
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.580]   person from the Father and the Son, which clearly he is in the way Jesus talks about
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.100]   him in John 14 and 15.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:24.540]   For example, the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.340]   teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you, John 14.26.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.300]   Or here's John 15.26.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.220]   When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.980]   Now that's the way you talk about a person, not an influence.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:02.220]   So these are some of the biblical building blocks of the doctrine of the Trinity, and
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.300]   there are many, many more.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:13.060]   Now the question Paul is asking in this episode of Ask Pastor John is, what degree of clarity
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:22.500]   in this life must a person have about the Trinity to affirm their true understanding
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.620]   of and trust in the God of the Bible?
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.460]   Now here's the way I want to try to answer this question.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.700]   Let's take the first letter of John, for example.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:43.500]   What we can see in this letter is a backdrop of some heretical teachings which determine
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.140]   what aspects of Christ's nature are required for the congregation to believe.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.300]   That's why it's so relevant for Paul's question.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.980]   And it appears that what is being emphasized in this first letter of John is both the deity
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:08.500]   and the earthy incarnation of the deity of the Son of God.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.380]   Both are necessary, in other words, to believe, to know about, and to distance yourself from
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.140]   the false teachers who are disputing these things.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.860]   And the point that I'm drawing out is that what we need to embrace about the Trinity
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:32.100]   or any doctrine, what we need to embrace explicitly or reject explicitly about the nature of Christ
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:41.760]   is often determined by what is being denied in our milieu, in our church, in the neighborhood
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.420]   where we live, or what is being falsely affirmed around us.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:55.540]   In other words, I don't know of any way to describe in the abstract which precise
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:03.100]   contours of the Trinity one must be clear about in order to be saved.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:11.060]   Rather, it seems to me from 1 John, as an example, and elsewhere, that we need to be
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.540]   authentic enough in our grasp of Christ's reality that when false things are said about
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:29.580]   him the authenticity of our faith recognizes those things and pushes them away rather than
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.860]   embracing them.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.180]   So let me give an example from 1 John.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.660]   Here's chapter 4, verse 9.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:42.100]   "In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.540]   the world so that we might live through him."
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.260]   Chapter 4, verse 15.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:55.340]   Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.100]   So you need to know that.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.420]   Or chapter 5, verse 10.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:06.260]   Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself, and whoever does not
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.620]   believe God has made him a liar.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.300]   Or John 5, 11.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.220]   This is the testimony that God gave us eternal life.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.940]   This life is in his Son.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.740]   Or one more, verse 13 of chapter 5.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:27.900]   "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.900]   know that you have eternal life."
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:38.220]   So it seems to me all of those verses stress the necessity of knowing Jesus as the Son
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.860]   of God, which is John's language for God the Son.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.980]   And then you read this in chapter 4, verse 2.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.680]   "By this you know the Spirit of God.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:58.340]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God."
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:05.220]   Now there the emphasis shifts from the deity, the Sonship of Christ, to his nitty-gritty,
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.500]   earthy coming in the flesh, his incarnation.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:16.820]   So in John's situation, where these truths are being challenged, they have to be confessed
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.880]   and believed.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.940]   So here's my suggestion.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:29.880]   My suggestion is that what 1 John shows us is that authentic saving faith is of such
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:39.500]   a nature that when false views of Christ's deity and false views of Christ's humanity
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:48.980]   are taught in the church, that authentic saving faith smells a rat and will at least have
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:57.720]   a big question mark and will go to the Scriptures and search out the truth and believe it.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:06.440]   So the practical implication of this for our life and our teaching, our families, our churches,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:15.340]   is that we not spend too much time trying to discern what is minimally necessary to
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:22.540]   believe about the Trinity, but rather devote a lot of our time to helping all believers
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:30.420]   have authentic, well-informed, biblically grounded faith in God the Father, God the
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.700]   Son, God the Holy Spirit, who are one God in three persons.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.700]   Glorious.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   Amen.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.380]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through this incredibly important question.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.780]   And thank you to everyone who is listening today, even with all the disruptions in this
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.780]   crazy year.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.180]   It has been an insane year.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.700]   Ministry for us has been full throttle in 2020.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.580]   In fact, it feels like the Lord has given us even more work to do this year in addressing
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.100]   the pandemic, particularly with the international launch of Pastor John's book, Coronavirus
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.700]   and Christ.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.420]   We invested tens of thousands of dollars to get that timely book translated and distributed
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.820]   around the world, working to make it available free of charge in 30 different languages,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.020]   including American Sign Language.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.580]   And at a time when so many organizations are slashing budgets and scaling back what they
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.060]   do, we are actually spending more money than ever to freely give away the best news in
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:31.020]   the world, the truth of our triune God and the death of Jesus Christ and his resurrection
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.460]   for sinners.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:38.460]   And all of our ministry, all of it, the website, the books from Pastor John, and of course
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.460]   this podcast, all of it is possible because God continues to raise up generous ministry
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.780]   partners around us.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.940]   People who just regularly pray for us and who donate to support all of our work.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.460]   If that's you, thank you for your partnership.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.460]   We can't do it without you.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.580]   I know a bunch of ministry partners listen to this podcast, and I wish I could say thank
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.340]   you to each and every one of you.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.780]   And hopefully at donor retreats, I will be able to do that more and more.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.120]   If this is not you, maybe you've been a listener to the podcast or a reader of the website
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.700]   for a while, or maybe you've downloaded free books from Pastor John or watched our YouTube
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.600]   videos and you've been blessed by the content our partners have made free of charge to you
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   in the past.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.580]   And now maybe you want to become someone who will now make those resources available to
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.080]   a new generation who will experience all of Pastor John and Desiring God's content free
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.180]   of charge for themselves.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.220]   If that's you, now is a great time to join us as our fiscal year ends in a few days at
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.420]   the end of June and our new fiscal year begins in July.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.720]   And we are dreaming about all the things we want to make, the new resources to come in
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.960]   the year ahead, and the new audiences we want to reach as well.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.400]   You can join us today by going online to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.640]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.680]   Pastor John and I thank you, and we will see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:06.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
