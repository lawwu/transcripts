[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Podcast listener named Gloria from Nigeria
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.200]   went to our online homepage and wrote us
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.880]   this follow-up email on weddings.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.080]   Pastor John, thank you for your episode
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.160]   on A Simple Wedding, episode 875, that was.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   I would like to know if parental consent
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.680]   and involvement is necessary in a marriage
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.720]   when both parties are up to 30 years old.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080]   Also, is it wrong to not adhere
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.400]   to Western wedding traditions,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.480]   such as a white dress, church ceremony,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.520]   and walking down the aisle, et cetera?
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.960]   Can we not just get our marriage license
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   from the registry and ask our pastor to bless us
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.360]   instead of having a ceremony in the church?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.660]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.000]   - Well, I hear three questions.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   Number one, what about permission of parents?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.320]   Number two, do you need to follow Western traditions?
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   Number three, is it legal or isn't legal registration
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.800]   and pastoral blessing enough
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   without any kind of Christian church ceremony?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240]   So let me just take these one at a time
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.000]   and give you a few suggestions,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.440]   a few pointers for each one.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   First, what about parental blessing?
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.520]   I think this is the most important one.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.800]   And I have five suggestions.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   Number one, one of the most basic biblical commands
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.320]   is honor your father and mother, Ephesians 6:2.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.160]   That's a broader, deeper command
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   than the particular command to obey them.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.120]   And therefore, I would encourage a couple
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.120]   to pray and work and wait for their parents' blessing.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.600]   How long they should wait will be determined
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.960]   by some of the other factors
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.060]   that I'm gonna mention in just a minute,
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.200]   but it's worth waiting for,
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.600]   even if you should wait a long time,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.080]   but probably not forever.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   And we should communicate to our parents
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.860]   that we long for their blessing.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.160]   Many parents will come your way
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   and bless you if they sense,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040]   if you show that you are not defiant,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.680]   but eager for their blessings.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   That's number one.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.080]   Number two, obedience to parents
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.080]   is not absolute in the Christian life,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.160]   but rather loyalty to Jesus is.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.080]   And I'll base that on Matthew 10, 35 to 37,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.040]   where Jesus says,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.840]   "I have come to set a man against his father
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.980]   and a daughter against her mother.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.520]   Whoever loves mother or father more than me
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   is not worthy of me," so on.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.200]   In other words, devotion to father and mother
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320]   is not absolute.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120]   Jesus is absolute.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.840]   Now, that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want to do
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   without reference to your parents,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.120]   but it does mean that there is a new factor
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   in the world that is greater than allegiance to parents,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.880]   namely allegiance to Jesus.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.480]   Third, we simply must admit that cultural realities
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.120]   in various people, groups, and tribes
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.480]   play a huge role in how to proceed with a marriage.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.800]   And I think when Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13, 5,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   that love, I'm gonna use King James here,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   love does not behave itself unseemly.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.040]   Now, that word unseemly means
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.360]   love doesn't blow off traditions.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.400]   Love doesn't blow off customs.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.440]   Love doesn't blow off mores.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   Love does not unnecessarily despise cultural traditions.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.800]   Therefore, the application of these suggestions
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.560]   that I'm making right now
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400]   are going to look very different in different cultures,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   and that's not sheer relativism.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.440]   It's a discerning application of the principle of love.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   Number four, fourth suggestion with regard to parents.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.920]   If you believe that your loyalty to Jesus
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.880]   is leading you to marry someone
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.720]   and you don't yet have your parents' approval,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.640]   you need to ask seriously,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   have my parents really proved themselves to be unfit
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.720]   in making such kingdom judgments?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   Perhaps they have.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.680]   Maybe they're not even Christians,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.400]   but don't fail to be sure.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.760]   I mean, that's a big question.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.800]   Have my parents, with all their experience
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   and all their love for me and all their wisdom,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.520]   really proved themselves to be, in this case,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.000]   unfit for making such kingdom judgments
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.120]   as the one I'm disagreeing on?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.560]   And the last thing I would say with regard to parents
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.920]   is however you move forward,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.360]   don't let there be a spirit of defiance
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   towards your parents or a spirit of indifference
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.000]   to what they say as if their opinions don't matter.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.520]   Let there be a spirit of humility and prayer and longing
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   so that they can discern
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.720]   that your desire is for their blessing.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   So that's the first question she asked.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.040]   The second question was,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.760]   do you need to follow Western traditions in this marriage?
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.200]   White dress, church ceremony, walking down the aisle.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.560]   And the answer is very simple.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.880]   No, you don't.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.960]   But I would caution that if you live in a culture
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.080]   where these traditions are cherished,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.520]   you need to have good Christ-exalting Bible-based reasons
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.840]   for doing things a different way.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.600]   Third question, can we not just get our marriage license
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.000]   and get a pastor to bless us
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.080]   and dispense with the church ceremony?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.000]   It might be helpful to point out
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.440]   that I used to hear the exact reverse question.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.600]   Like, can't we just have a Christian ceremony
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.320]   and skip the legal registration?
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.840]   It's really funny that things change around.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   I think my answer to both of those kinds of questions
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.960]   is to encourage young couples not to reinvent the wheel
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.160]   so quickly when dealing with a God-designed chariot
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.880]   as old and venerable and sacred and God-ordained
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.960]   and state-sanctioned as the institution of marriage.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.160]   I think there's way too much playing around
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.240]   with wedding ceremonies in the name of personal creativity.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.000]   I think couples should pause
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.400]   and wonder whether they are fit to be so creative
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.760]   with something so majestic and so holy
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   and so ancient as God's order of marriage.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.360]   It may be that weddings
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.600]   should not express a couple's uniqueness.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   I think most couples just enter,
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.320]   oh, we gotta show our uniqueness here.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.080]   Maybe it's exactly the opposite.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.320]   Maybe you're joining something
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   that has been around for thousands and thousands of years
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   and has its origin in heaven,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.040]   and the last thing you should be thinking
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.880]   is creativity and uniqueness,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.920]   but rather we are being given something here.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.240]   We've been giving admission to something here
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.880]   that God is creating.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   Let's make it as holy and sacred
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.920]   and joyful and rooted as we can.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.480]   At least I'd like to change a lot of mindsets
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   with regard to thinking about weddings in this regard.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.640]   The reason we have Christian ceremonies
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.040]   and legal registrations for marriage
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.120]   is not because the Bible says we have to,
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   but because there are aspects of Christian discipleship
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.680]   which make both of these a matter of wisdom.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.360]   On the one hand, we're citizens of this world
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.040]   called to be subject to the authorities
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.480]   that exist in Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.680]   which means that Christians will not try
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.600]   to get around the legal dimensions of marriage
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.360]   if they don't involve sin.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.480]   On the other hand, however,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   it's not the state, it's not the national state
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.800]   that creates a marriage.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.440]   God does.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.840]   Jesus said, "What God has joined together,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.480]   "let no man separate."
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.640]   God is the one who joins in marriage,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.000]   not the state, not the couple, for goodness sakes,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.440]   not the pastor, not the priest, not the parents.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.360]   God does.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.920]   God creates a marriage in heaven,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.320]   and it is unbreakable except by death.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.240]   God made this, let not man separate it.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.400]   So it seems wonderfully suitable to me
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   that there be some kind of Christian solemnizing
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.840]   of this sacred, holy, divine work
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.560]   that can only be broken by death.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.520]   So my final word to Gloria is cultivate
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   a Bible-saturated, humble spirit of utter allegiance
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.080]   to Jesus and guard yourself from any roots
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   of self-exaltation or defiance towards parents
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   or towards tradition.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.680]   Seek the kingdom first, and God will show you the way.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.800]   - That's good.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.600]   And we talked about simple weddings in episode 875.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.360]   You can check that out in the archive.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.680]   It's titled Weddings Don't Break the Bank.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.360]   It's in the archive of past episodes
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.000]   in the APJ app for Apple and Android devices
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   or at our web home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.640]   And tomorrow we field a question from a listener
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.880]   who wants to know if embracing medical technology
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.600]   and medicine impedes God's will for our lives
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.560]   and for our suffering.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.540]   How do we know?
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.920]   You don't wanna miss this episode.
