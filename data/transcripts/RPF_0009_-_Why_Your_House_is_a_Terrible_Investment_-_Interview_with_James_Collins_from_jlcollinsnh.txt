[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Joshua Sheets, TMZ Foundation Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.120]   Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets. Today's show is certain to be challenging,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.320]   controversial and I hope appropriately radical. Our topic today is real estate and we'll be
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.240]   discussing why your house is a terrible investment, how to do a proper rent versus own calculation
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.320]   and other wealth building topics with our special guest, James Collins. James got his
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.440]   start selling flyswatters door to door and picking up empty pop bottles from the side
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.920]   of the road at eight years old. Since then, he's earned his living as a soda jerk, bus
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   boy, a dishwasher, an order puller, a grocery bagger, a stock clerk, a produce clerk and
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.760]   a gas station pump jockey, a mail clerk, ground man for a tree crew, landscaper, ad agency
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   founder, account executive, ad space salesman, investment officer, entrepreneur, consultant,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.680]   sales trainer, speaker, writer, radio talk show host and a publisher.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   Today he is officially retired, sort of, but from time to time he shares his wisdom with
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.720]   the world over at JLCollinsNH.com in addition to sitting on a couple of corporate boards
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.400]   for small entrepreneurial companies that he finds interesting. James, welcome to the Radical
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.320]   Personal Finance Podcast. James Collins, Jr.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   Thank you, Joshua, but I got to say that sounds like a guy who can't hold a job.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.120]   When I went and read your about page I couldn't resent because you did such a good job on
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.280]   there. That is a great list. It was kind of my life flashing before my
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.360]   eyes. I figured it out one time. I had, someday I
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.960]   got to make that list for myself because I think I had like 20 jobs or something like
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.080]   that by the time I was in my 20s and anyway I got to go and like count them all up sometime
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.400]   but it's so fun to do that and see all the different experiences.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.640]   Well, it is kind of fun and of course when you do that you think back on them and I can
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   honestly say with maybe one or two exceptions I like doing them all.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Well, that's good. So today I'm excited to have this interview with you. I think it's
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.000]   going to be fun. We're going to attack the American religion of home ownership which
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.120]   I'm excited to do. Oh goody, I'm going to get in trouble with
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.800]   some more people now. Exactly. So we'll get into that in just a second
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.160]   though. Before we do, give the audience just a quick background on you, kind of your history
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.480]   in addition to what I just shared and specifically how did you get interested in the topics of
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   money and personal finance? Well, that's a great question. I think actually
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   I've probably been interested in that since the very beginning. I mean, anybody who picks
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.400]   up pop bottles on the side of the road when they're eight is obviously interested in money.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.080]   I got a two cent, in those days pop bottles had a two cent deposit on them. So I was making
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.360]   nickels and dimes but I guess I've always liked earning money and at some point I discovered
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.000]   that my money could earn money. That was a real eye opening experience and of course
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.120]   that's a route to financially independent and being financially independent and being
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   much more able to pick and choose what kind of work if any you want to do at various points
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.640]   in your life. So once I discovered that then the whole world
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.920]   of investing opened up to me and I started exploring that and making mistake after mistake
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   after mistake. And so when I write my blog and I talk about the various concepts that
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.960]   I have behind the way, I look at investing, index funds being the core example. I probably
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   come to that by making mistakes in investing and all the other things. I mean, when I hear
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.960]   people arguing about index funds, I will argue against them. I hear myself 25 years ago.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:12.720]   I know those arguments I used to make. So yeah, that's kind of how it started and developed.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   >> I know you write a blog on varied topics and you've got a lot of interesting things
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.240]   that we could talk about but I want to talk about your favorite essay or excuse me, my
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.840]   favorite essay on your blog. And I don't know what your favorite is but this one is my favorite.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   >> And the one you picked by the way is also the one that has proven to be most controversial
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   and got me the most hate. >> Good.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   >> Easy for you to say. Fortunately, most of that hate has occurred on forums other
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   than my blog. My readers are a much more civil group by and large but not that they necessarily
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.240]   agree with me all the time but they are civil in the conversation. But I've had other forums
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   pointed out to me where that's not so much the case.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   >> Yeah. Well, the tone that I hope that my show has as time goes by is that it's just
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.480]   to look at facts and not come with a bias that this is the right way or that's the right
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.160]   way but look at facts and look at individual situations. And what I love was that this
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.540]   essay that I'm about to read really did a good job of kind of laying out some facts.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.400]   And so in the right situation, different people are going to make different choices. And I
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.640]   think that after we read the essay, we'll talk about that because you've made different
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.040]   choices as time gets on over the years. But I think this is going to be a really valuable
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.520]   tool for people who are considering buying houses, renting houses and to give them some
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   confidence that they can make their own decision based upon what their goals are. So what I'm
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.760]   going to do is since I've got the author here with your permission, I'm actually going to
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   read your essay. I've read this essay at least half a dozen times to friends and family members
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.920]   so that's how compelling that I think it is. And then we'll talk about it. So anything
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.840]   you want to add before I read it though?
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.960]   >> No. I mean, the only thing I would say is that as you're going to read it and I think
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.680]   one of the reasons that it drew some negative response from some corners is that in and
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.440]   of itself it makes it sound like I think that nobody should ever own a home under any circumstances.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.560]   And there are other, and I know we're going to talk about this, there are other posts
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.200]   on the blog that talk about one being roots and wings where home ownership is, home ownership
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.960]   is a very personal decision and it's not just a financial one. So the essay you're about
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.760]   to read is based on looking at it just as a financial tool, as an investment alone,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.160]   taking out any of the other considerations. And maybe when you're done I'll explain why
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.960]   I think that's a useful exercise.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.560]   >> Absolutely. So let me read it here. This is James' essay, "Why Your House Is a Terrible
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.440]   Investment." "My pal James Altucher calls home ownership a part of the American religion.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.800]   So I know I'm treading dangerous ground here. But before you get out the tar and feathers
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.920]   let's do a little thought experiment together. Imagine over a cup of coffee or a glass of
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.440]   wine we get to talking about investments and maybe one of us says, "Hey, I've got an idea.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.320]   We're always talking about good investments. What if we came up with the worst possible
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.920]   investment we can construct? What might that look like?" Well, let's see now. Let's make
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.880]   a list. To be really terrible it should be not just an initial but if we do it right
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.240]   a relentlessly ongoing drain on the cash reserves of the owner. It should be illiquid. We'll
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.000]   make it something that takes weeks. No, wait, even better, months of time and effort to
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.680]   buy or sell. It should be expensive to buy and sell. We'll add very high transaction
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.720]   costs, maybe 5% commissions on a deal coming and going. It should be complex to buy or
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.480]   sell. That way we can ladle on lots of extra fees and reports and documents we can charge
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:19.800]   for. It should generate low returns, certainly no more than the inflation rate, maybe a bit
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   less. It should be leveraged. This one's great. This is how we'll get people to swallow those
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.560]   low returns. If the price goes up a little bit leverage will magnify this and people
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.680]   will convince themselves it's actually a good investment. Don't worry about it. Most will
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.840]   never even consider that leverage is also very high risk and could just as easily wipe
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.200]   them out. It should be mortgaged. Another beauty of leverage. We can charge interest
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.400]   on the loans. Yep, and with just a little more effort we should easily be able to persuade
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.000]   people who buy this thing to borrow money against it more than once. It should be unproductive.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.280]   While we're talking about interest, let's be sure this investment we're creating never
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:08.040]   pays any. No dividends either of course. It should be immobile. If we can fix it to one
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.480]   geographical spot we can be sure at any given time only a tiny group of potential buyers
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.800]   for it will exist. Sometimes, some places, none at all. It should be subject to the fortunes
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.600]   of one country, one state, one city, one town, no, one neighborhood. Imagine if our investment
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.160]   could somehow tie its owner to the fate of one narrow location. The risk could be enormous.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.520]   A plant closes, a street gang moves in, a government goes crazy with taxes, an environmental
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.120]   disaster happens nearby. We could have an investment that not only crushes its owner's
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.080]   net worth but does so even as they are losing their job and income. It should be something
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.520]   that locks its owner in one geographical area. That'll limit their options and keep them
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.200]   docile for their employers. It should be expensive. Ideally, we'll make it so expensive that it
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.120]   will represent a disproportionate percentage of a person's net worth. Nothing like squeezing
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   out diversification to increase risk. It should be expensive to own too. Let's make sure this
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   investment requires an endless parade of repairs and maintenance without which it will crumble
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.760]   into dust. It should be fragile and easily damaged by weather, fire, vandalism and the
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.520]   like. Now we can add on expensive insurance to cover these risks, making sure, of course,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   that the bad things that are most likely to happen aren't actually covered. Don't worry.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.340]   We'll bury that in the fine print or maybe just charge extra for it. It should be heavily
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.260]   taxed too. Let's get the feds in on this. If it should go up in value, we'll go ahead
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.880]   and tax that gain. If it goes down in value, should we offer a balancing tax deduction
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.560]   on the loss like with other investments? Nah. It should be taxed even more. Let's not forget
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.860]   our state and local governments. Why wait till this investment is sold? Unlike other
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.480]   investments, let's tax it each and every year. Oh, and let's raise those taxes any time it
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.580]   goes up in value. Lower than when it goes down? Don't be silly. It should be something
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.440]   that you can never really own. Since we're going to give the government the power to
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.800]   tax this investment every year, owning it will be just like sharecropping. We'll let
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.340]   them work it, maintain it, pay all the costs associated with it, and as long as they pay
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.680]   their annual rent -- oops, I mean taxes -- we'll let them stay in it, unless we decide we want
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.820]   it. For that, we'll make it subject to eminent domain. You know, in case we decide that instead
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.080]   of getting our rent -- darn, I mean taxes -- we'd rather just take it away from them.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.240]   I'm adding two bonus ones here for you, James, from your commenters. It should increase stress,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.760]   lead to more divorces, but then be impossible to divide. And finally, you only need one
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.160]   motivated -- read -- desperate seller to set the price for the whole neighborhood. Imagine
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.600]   your so-called investment suddenly gets scuttled when your neighbor decides to sell his particle
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.960]   board mansion at 20% below assessment. Wow, howdy, that's quite a list. Any investment
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.480]   that ugly would make my skin crawl. In fact, I'm not sure you could rightly call anything
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.400]   with those characteristics an investment at all. Then, too, the challenge would be to
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.800]   get anybody to buy this turkey, but we can. In fact, I bet we can get them not only to
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:38.360]   buy, but to believe that doing so is the fulfillment of a national dream, nay, a national birthright.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.840]   So that, Jim, is one of my favorite essays that is in the personal finance blog. And
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.320]   I thank you for writing it. It's a gem.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   >> You're welcome.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   >> So, yes, obviously, right before the essay -- and by the way, you mentioned earlier James
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.200]   Altucher, who's also one of my favorite bloggers. I will link to his posts on home ownership.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.000]   He also writes two excellent essays on home ownership. But you rightly point out --
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   >> His assessment, by the way, is even harsher than mine.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.320]   >> Oh, yeah. But then again, there's nothing tame about any of his essays. So he's good
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   at stirring the pot.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   >> That's true.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:30.000]   >> So just to start with, I think that you made a valid point before, is that the key
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.440]   point here is that -- and the essay is ironic. It's a little bit tongue-in-cheek. But the
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.280]   key point here is not that people shouldn't buy a house. Knowing all of these things very
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.640]   well, I personally bought a house seven months ago. And I'm very happy with that decision.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.240]   I don't have any problem with it. I'm pleased to be there. And we'll talk about why. It's
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.160]   not that people shouldn't buy houses. But it's the fact that it's a different set of
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.920]   decision criteria. And it's not just that buying is always better than renting. Is that
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   a good place to start?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:09.760]   >> I think that's a good place to start. And I would also add, the thing that I was probably
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:16.880]   reacting to as I wrote this was the common wisdom that buying a house is always a good
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.840]   investment. There are lots of reasons to buy a house. But buying one as an investment should
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:29.240]   be at the bottom of that list, if on that list at all. Owning a house -- and I actually
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.280]   just sold my house in the spring. I'm now renting, which I'm thrilled to be doing, by
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.240]   the way. But prior to that, I owned that house for 13 years. And I owned the house before
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:46.840]   that for 15 years. So I have been a homeowner for 28 years. I, too, have seen in my lifetimes
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.120]   when it makes sense to own a house. But I've never lost sight of the fact that it is a
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.000]   decision that is always an expensive indulgence. As long as you understand the expense you're
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.800]   undertaking in buying that house, and that you're indulging in a consumer good, so to
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.280]   speak, in the way that buying a Mercedes is a consumer good, then I have no problem with
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.800]   how you spend your money. That's entirely up to you.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.200]   >> Yeah, absolutely. And the interesting thing is that most people -- I think you make a
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.440]   good example with the car. There's absolutely nothing wrong with driving a fancy car. If
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.560]   that floats your boat and you want to and it's your money, go for it. But many times
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.200]   you'll find that people who drive fancy cars feel a little bit -- they do it with a little
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.320]   bit of a red face sometimes. They make comments saying, "Well, you know, it's an indulgence
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.800]   for myself." But yet so many times people will go and they'll buy a fancy house and
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.400]   they'll justify it with the idea that, "Well, at least it's a house. At least I own something.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.080]   At least it's going to go up in value and it's a good investment." So as long as we
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.920]   kind of make that differentiation, then you can look at it accurately and start with what
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.280]   I would say is a rational way to do it, which is, "What are my needs? What are my wants?
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.720]   What level of luxury do I want?" And then let's make a shopping decision and say, "In
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.760]   my market, in my area, with my needs and wants, what can I buy? What can I rent? How can I
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.240]   arrange my living space in such a way that I can get everything that I want in life in
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   an efficient manner?"
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:32.320]   >> Exactly, in a manner that you can afford. There's nothing magic about houses and I think
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.480]   that people are convinced that they are. They're convinced that they're buying a great investment
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   and therefore they can and should buy more house than they need or maybe more house than
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.320]   they can really afford. And there are a lot of things in our society, a lot of institutions
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.240]   that drive that way of thinking and it's profitable for them to drive it. Real estate industry
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.000]   is of course at the top of that list. I mean, real estate industry loves it when we buy
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.480]   and sell houses. The whole idea that you start with a starter house and then you buy a little
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.320]   better house and a little better house and then finally you get into your ultimate house
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.760]   and then when your kids are grown you sell that and you go into your retirement house.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:20.560]   I mean, that's not an accident that that's the path that is laid out in the shining waters
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:27.480]   down the line. I mean, it's a very profitable path for us to follow for the people selling
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.280]   us the houses or for the people selling us the services to maintain those houses or to
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.720]   insure them or to mortgage them. So, there are a lot of people who make money owning
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.480]   houses, not so much the people who buy them. And when they do, it's more often as I mentioned
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.080]   in that essay you just read, it's more often a function of leverage working for them than
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.120]   a good investment working for them. And I think people didn't really understand that
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.600]   and when the housing market collapsed a few years ago, that of course is what caused it
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   to collapse is that leverage can work very powerfully for you and for many years in housing
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.040]   it did but it can also work very powerfully against you. And so, suddenly people were
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.080]   taking out mortgages for 95, sometimes even 100% of the price of the house. I won't even
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.880]   say value because the houses have gone way beyond what they were really worth but the
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   price of the house. Well, if that house then goes up 10% and you've borrowed 100% of the
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.840]   money, you've made $10,000 for a $100,000 house, you've made $10,000 let's say out of
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.560]   thin air and that's got to feel wonderful. But if it goes down 10%, you've just lost
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   $10,000 that you might not have and that many, many people didn't have and the next thing
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.560]   you know you're foreclosed. And there in a nutshell is what happened when housing collapsed.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.120]   And I think I want to continue on that theme of leverage for a moment and point out where,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   why houses are a useful point for leverage and then where the disadvantages are. I think
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.520]   my thoughts is that for the most part people are comfortable leveraging houses because
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.160]   everybody leverages houses. It's common and it's understood. People understand if I buy
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   a 30-year fixed rate mortgage then this is how it works and this is what happens. So
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.280]   they're comfortable doing it. They forget that many things can be leveraged. You can
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   borrow money to buy just about anything including other investments. So it's just that most
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.840]   people don't have a margin account open with their stock broker. They're not accustomed
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   to how that works and they're not accustomed to how that works so they're comfortable
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.000]   buying and getting a mortgage though. Now when it comes to that little comparison, to
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.720]   be fair, the advantage does go to the house. So if you're looking for ways to leverage
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.800]   and you want to use real estate as a place to leverage, it's been a dramatically good
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.660]   time to do that with low interest rates, interest rates near the long-term rate of inflation.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.700]   Also with the fact that generally mortgages are not callable. So if your house does decline
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:18.620]   in value by 10% like in your example, if you can figure out how to make the monthly payment
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.200]   you might be able to afford to sit and wait it out. Whereas on a margin account with a
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   stock broker, generally if your account value declines below the term set in the margin
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.220]   agreement, they're going to sell your investment. They're going to sell your stocks and the
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.060]   stock broker is just going to take the money. So there are some advantages there to leveraging
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.780]   real estate that don't exist in other areas.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.900]   >> Well you're absolutely right and that's not a mistake by the way. It didn't happen
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:56.340]   by mistake. During the Great Depression, before the Great Depression, very, very few people
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:02.060]   borrowed money for houses. I mean if you wanted to buy a house, and this is true in many places
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.660]   in the world today by the way.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:10.660]   >> Sorry, hang on one second. My phone is ringing on my, I can't figure out how to turn
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.800]   it off. Here we go. All right, keep going. Sorry about that.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.600]   >> No, I'll just back up a second.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   >> Internet phone, keep going.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   >> And I'll say that it's not a mistake that houses are easily leveraged, easily mortgaged
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:32.440]   and there are certain protections to that. Before the Great Depression, people didn't
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.720]   borrow money to buy houses. By the way, in many parts of the world today, people don't
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.480]   borrow money to buy houses. It's a certain financial structure that the government put
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   in place in the 1930s and they wanted to, there was a lot of social unrest in those
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.040]   times because of the Depression and of course there were a lot of European countries that
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   were going the way of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia and there was a fair amount of, there
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.000]   was a fair amount of social unrest leaning in those directions in this country and the
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   government wanted to stabilize that. And one of the things they very strategically did
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   or one of the concepts they very strategically came up with was that if we want people to
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.800]   have a stake in the society and one of the ways to do that is for them to own a house.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:30.000]   And one of the ways to do that is allow them to borrow money to own a house and we want
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   to make that available and desirable and we want to encourage banks to extend that money
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.440]   and that was kind of the beginning of it. That's one of the reasons for some of the
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   points that you made. So there's a real strong motivation to push people into houses and
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.200]   it may be good, it's certainly, you can make the argument good for the country and it might
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.800]   also be good for the individuals, for many people it is, but not always. And that's a
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.000]   decision that people ought to, if you decide to buy a house, and I would never suggest
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.120]   that don't buy a house, what I would suggest is go in with your eyes open and understand
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.440]   what you're doing and make sure that you're doing it because you've run the numbers, you've
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.020]   calculated the risks and the benefits and it best fits your needs, not because you've
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.560]   always heard it's a good thing to do.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   >> It's interesting how that whole government stabilization kind of track when taken to
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.600]   its ultimate conclusion back in the early 2000s. I would argue that that made a significant
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.200]   contribution to the real estate bubble and it's interesting how when you take anything
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.400]   to an extreme, it always seems to turn on itself.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   >> Well, I think that's true and all of these things are done with the best of intentions,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.660]   right? The expression of the road to hell is paved with good intentions. But yeah, you
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:08.660]   have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who are guaranteeing loans, federally guaranteeing mortgage loans,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:15.180]   of course that's done to make banks more willing to issue those loans and then the banks figured
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:22.180]   out that unlike that famous movie from the 40s, It's a Wonderful Life where you place
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:28.020]   the banker in the community and people deposit their money in the local bank and then the
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.540]   bank lends it out and other people build and buy houses and over time they pay the bank
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:33.740]   back.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:39.740]   Well, of course that's not how it works anymore. I mean the bank or the mortgage lender might
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.340]   not even be a bank, issues the loan and then they probably turn around and sell it. And
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.780]   they sold it to Wall Street firms who would bundle it and resell it as a package and sometimes
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:58.780]   they'd strip out the payments and it became a whole different kind of product and for
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:06.540]   a while there was an insatiable market for this stuff. And so lenders became more and
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.900]   more aggressive in seeking out borrowers and by aggressive I mean they lowered their standards
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:19.900]   more and more and more. So when I first bought a house, you put 20% down. I mean at the end
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:25.060]   of just before it blew up, people were buying houses with nothing. Now people were buying
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   houses where not only did they put nothing down but the lender would kick in 5, 10, 15
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.020]   dollars to fix the place up. So you could buy a house not only with no money down but
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:45.020]   they'd actually cut you a check. Well, that all came out of the incredible demand for
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:50.940]   these packaged products that Wall Street was creating and selling.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.460]   >> Eric Lander: It's amazing the distortion that that brings to the market.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:01.220]   >> Tom Hanks: And all of it was federally guaranteed which is why we wound up on the
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.220]   front porch.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.460]   >> Eric Lander: Yeah. So to be fair, you've been a homeowner up until this year for the
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:14.460]   last 28 years. What were some of the reasons that you owned two houses in a row?
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.300]   >> Tom Hanks: Well, let me start with the most recent one. We live in New Hampshire
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.740]   now and when we moved to New Hampshire, my daughter was in second grade. And as anybody
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:31.740]   who has kids will appreciate, when you have kids, most all of your decisions revolve around
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:39.060]   what's best for your kids and what's best for raising them. And there are advantages
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.420]   to raising a kid in a house in the kind of neighborhood that we were fortunate to be
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:51.460]   able to afford and the kind of school district that I wanted her to have access to.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.620]   Before when we lived in Ohio, we lived in an inner ring suburb. It was a very urban
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:03.260]   suburb and we like city life. This is before our daughter was born. And we bought that
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:09.820]   house. We've been renting and we liked renting but I got restless quite honestly and I like
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.500]   change. We kind of started going out looking at houses just for kicks and we found one
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.780]   that was a beautiful old century house that just really appealed to us emotionally and
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.020]   we could pretty easily afford it. We bought it but then when our daughter came along,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.740]   it wasn't in a particularly good school district. And of course, we hadn't been thinking about
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:34.420]   that and the purchase of that house. So we sent her to private school for kindergarten
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.820]   first and half of second grade. And then as I say, we happened to move to New Hampshire
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.700]   but when we moved to New Hampshire and I was looking at neighborhood and school district
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:51.220]   were the big things that were driving that factor. But I never for a moment thought that
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:56.500]   these were great investments. They were lifestyle choices I was making and that I could easily
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:03.340]   afford. And by the way, neither one of them came close to costing what the real estate
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.020]   agents and the mortgage companies were telling me I could afford and worse were telling me
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.140]   I should afford. There's a lot of pressure on people when they go out and buy houses
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:18.740]   to, "Oh, you can afford half a million dollars for a house. So obviously, you want to look
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:25.740]   at half a million dollar houses." Well, maybe but that's probably the outlier of what you
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.780]   can afford. And in my world, you don't buy the absolute most you can afford. You buy
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:37.780]   something considerably less than that so you have considerably less risk involved in owning.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:43.860]   >> Yeah. There's something about house fever that seems to be one of the most incredible
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:49.420]   like powerful fevers that people get. And maybe it's because it's so visible, maybe
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:55.580]   it's because it involves something that all of our friends know where we live but it's
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:01.020]   so common. You see people and they get house fever and it's easy to succumb.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:08.020]   >> Well, I mean that's true and I actually wrote a post on the emotional aspects of owning
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.540]   houses and I entitled it Roots versus Wings. And one of the things that was striking to
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:20.340]   me when we sold our house this past spring and we by the way had been trying to sell
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.620]   this house for three years. I mean, as soon as our daughter went off to college, we were
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   ready because the house, we no longer needed the advantages that the house provided. We
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.260]   didn't need the school district or the neighborhood and I've never been one to be emotionally
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:41.260]   attached to anything I own and that includes houses. So we immediately were looking to
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.500]   sell. Unfortunately, as most people will remember, it was very bad market to be trying to sell
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.860]   a house in. So we didn't have much luck until the spring. But what was striking, so by the
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   spring I was really, really ready to be rid of this house in a real profound way and go
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   back to the much more carefree lifestyle of renting. But what was striking to me is the
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.220]   young couple who bought it and it was a young couple who bought it and they had two little
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.140]   girls who were just about the age that my daughter was when we bought it, could not
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.420]   have been more thrilled to acquire this thing. I could not have been more thrilled to get
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.820]   rid of it. And it's a difference in needs at the time. I mean, they were looking to
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.820]   put down roots and raise a family. My wife and I were looking to spread our wings and
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:38.380]   have a lot less obligations and a lot less ties and a lot more flexibility in where we
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:44.580]   live and how we live and how we travel. And it's a different needs. So I did this post
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:50.740]   based on what I call Roots vs. Wings that talks about those different kinds of things.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.140]   There was that when I was doing a garage sale to get rid of some of the stuff in preparation
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.260]   for the move, there was another young couple who came and they picked up a lot of the garden
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.580]   tools and things that we were selling and we get to talking and they just bought a house.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:10.900]   They got it in a foreclosure sale and they evidently, I don't know the numbers, they
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.060]   didn't share them, but they seemed to think they got a great deal on it and they were
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.780]   real excited but needed a lot of work and they were excited to do that. And this is
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.420]   a young couple who are looking to put down roots. So some people are roots people, some
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:29.180]   people are wings people. I think I'm personally more of a wings person but that's also varied
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:34.180]   depending on what was going on in my life at the time.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.100]   That would be similar to where my wife and I are with our housing decisions. We bought
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.980]   a house in January of this year.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.580]   My condolences.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:51.460]   And we thought pretty carefully about it because we really considered what did we want to do
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:59.900]   and what were we looking for. I ran the Rent vs. Own calculations and analysis and I want
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.340]   to come back to that and spend a good bit of time walking people through that. But one
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.860]   challenge with Rent vs. Own is that a national or I guess international podcast or a national
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:15.980]   magazine article can never tell the story of what's going on in any one neighborhood.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.220]   Everything is intensely local and if you don't factor that into your decision making and
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:30.380]   look at your specific scenario and run the numbers on your specific situation it's tough
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.940]   to, you've got to run the numbers which is why I probably spend the back half of the
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.500]   show walking through how to do that.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:47.660]   But for us we wanted some place where we could grow a garden without any problem. I'm into
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.700]   a lot of urban homesteading stuff. I want to grow a garden. I want my house to be super
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:59.220]   efficient and low ongoing costs. I want a backyard for the dogs. So we found a house
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.740]   that was exactly what we were looking for right next to the grocery store and the library
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:11.580]   at the third of the mile from my office. So with all of these advantages of being so geographically
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.700]   centrally located and all that plus the timing and the market was a fair price. It was cheaper
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.540]   than what we could rent something for. So all those things put together it came out
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.900]   and we decided it's a good decision. But it wasn't based upon any idea that I was going
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.540]   to get rich by owning a house and my experience over the first seven, eight months of home
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.140]   ownership has been that it has definitely taken money out of my pocket as it's want
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   to do.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:47.020]   >> Probably in ways that you never anticipated. I mean that's one of the insidious things
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:53.740]   about it. You know as I hope has come across so far in our conversation here as harsh as
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.220]   the essay you read is and I meant it to be a little harsh. I also as you pointed out
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:03.660]   meant it to be tongue in cheek and I hope that comes across. But the point, the fundamental
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:10.180]   point is not don't buy a house. The fundamental point is to run the numbers and understand
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:16.500]   what you're getting yourself into. And I actually have a tendency to do this with everything
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:22.540]   that I buy or everything that I own or do that involves money. I want to know what it's
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.900]   going to cost me, what it's really going to cost me. Most people have no idea what the
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:31.420]   car cost them to operate. I know to the penny what my car cost me to operate. Maybe I'm
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.620]   sick by doing that but I think it's useful to know what things actually cost you. And
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.940]   most people in my experience don't have a clue. So in buying a house I think the first
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.940]   thing to do is to start out and run the numbers and see how it compare. You're looking at
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.740]   to buy a house and as you were six, eight months ago. So you say okay I'm going to run
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.460]   the numbers based on this house that I think I want to buy and then I can compare it with
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:04.220]   what it's going to cost me to where I am living now. And it will either be higher or lower.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.780]   If it's lower and I want to move, I like this house and it's kind of a bit of a no brainer.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.620]   If it's higher that doesn't mean you shouldn't necessarily do it but it does mean that you
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.900]   now know that it's going to cost you money to own this thing that you think you want
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.780]   to own. And you'll have a pretty good idea of how much money it's going to cost you.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.540]   And it's not just the purchase price by the way, it's the ongoing cost that you have to
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.420]   consider. And once you know that then you can make a rational decision as to whether
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:38.100]   or not that is money well spent. And of course you have to look at it in terms of not only
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.500]   is it money well spent but what else could that money be doing for you. And then it's
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   your call. I mean if you look at it and you say okay I'm living in the place I am currently
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.900]   in but I want to buy this house but it's going to cost me an extra $10,000 a year to live
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:00.140]   in this house. Now you know and now you can make a decision as to whether you have that
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:06.940]   $10,000 and whether that's how you want to spend that $10,000 knowing you have it. Or
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:13.940]   whether that $10,000 would be better invested or better in a different car or whatever floats
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.300]   your boat.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:22.300]   >> And now we get into one of my, I think is, I wish high school classes hammered opportunity
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:29.740]   costs home into every student's head every day for four years of high school so that
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.780]   everyone could say oh the opportunity cost of my decision here is such and such. Because
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.460]   people forget the concept that you just talked about which is the opportunity cost is that
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.340]   if I'm going to make this purchase what am I giving up and what is the alternative use
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.900]   of the dollar. And that's what you have to do I think with every buying decision in order
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:52.820]   to make good decisions. If you don't run that scenario you just jump at thing after thing
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:57.900]   after thing. But if you run that scenario you don't get buyers remorse. But you've got
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.460]   to run that.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:05.460]   >> Well you don't have buyers remorse because you really understand what you just bought.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.260]   And by virtue of going through the process of understanding what you're about to buy
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.900]   you have a chance to back away from it if in fact it is something that would turn out
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:21.140]   to give you buyers remorse. But I agree with you the opportunity cost is the single biggest
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.260]   thing that people don't understand and they don't think about it when it comes to their
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:32.260]   home ownership. And the most glaring way I see that is people who, you know my house
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.940]   I've chosen to pay off the mortgage for a variety of reasons. So I owned it free and
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:44.100]   clear and people say well gee you know then you don't have any cost in your house. You
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:50.860]   don't have a mortgage. Well no I mean I have a huge amount of capital tied up that is stagnant.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:56.100]   It's not doing anything. There is an opportunity cost to that. Owning your house free and clear
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.420]   is not necessarily better than having a mortgage. It's different. But you still have, there's
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:08.420]   still a very real cost in having that capital tied up in that house. And that's by the way
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:15.340]   in the formula that I talk about in the post I think you want to get to is one of the key
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:20.820]   things that I talk about is calculating what that opportunity cost is. So you have a realistic
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.180]   when you're comparing owning a house, not owning a house or even owning this house versus
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:33.180]   some other house. You have an accurate assessment of what you're looking at. If you don't consider
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.660]   the effect of having a bunch of capital tied up and that does, and by the way you don't
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:44.020]   have to have your house paid off for this to be an effect that you have to consider.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.620]   I mean just putting money down on your house ties up a certain amount of capital to the
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.980]   degree of how much you're putting down.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:56.300]   Absolutely. And if you don't put much down you got to ask yourself what's your back door
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:02.020]   out. I think in any transaction you should have an exit plan in case you need to get
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.820]   out. And you should consider the ultimate potential downside and see if you're willing
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:13.340]   to live with that. And that is one of the most dangerous things in the no money down
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:19.820]   world over the last decade whenever that was possible. Things would change and if people
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.460]   hadn't factored in a margin of safety into their decision their job would change and
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.260]   they have to move. Well now they're stuck, they can't sell the house because they're
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.340]   upside down in it and then they can't rent it out for more than they're paying and now
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.780]   they got a house in Colorado when they're living in Florida or vice versa and they're
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.100]   trying to be a landlord from across the country.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:44.100]   So just by going a little bit slower, having a margin of safety and having an exit plan
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.340]   it'll help eliminate some of the stress in life.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.180]   I think that's a great point. Having an exit plan is a great point and a great strategy
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:58.220]   and a lot fewer people would buy a lot fewer houses if they thought in those terms and
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.780]   they'd buy a lot fewer bad investments of all kinds. The moment you buy a house you
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.100]   start thinking about buying a house you ought to be thinking about how you're going to sell
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:08.900]   it.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   I got a lot of pushback from that essay you read and in fact I'm going to do a follow
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:24.220]   up post kind of addressing some of the points that people make because a lot of them repeat.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:30.980]   But one of the points that comes up on a routine basis is well if I own a house I can do anything
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.300]   I want to. If I want to knock down a wall I can knock down a wall. If I want to paint
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:42.300]   a room black I can paint a room black. Well yeah technically that's true if you don't
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:50.620]   care anything about resale value. If you want to start knocking down walls or punching holes
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:58.140]   in walls and painting rooms black and parking junk cars in your yard which of course will
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:06.300]   irritate your neighbors you can do that when you own a house but you're going to destroy
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.540]   any value you have in that house. Most people are smart enough not to want to do that so
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:17.540]   the truth is that no owning a house doesn't mean you can do anything you want. The irony
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:22.540]   is when you own a house you spend most of your time fixing it up preparing it and caring
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.900]   for it for the next people who are going to own your house for the people you're going
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   to sell it to. At least if you're looking at it with any kind of financial savvy.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   So how did you do your rent versus buy analysis with the recent move that you've made?
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   Well let's take a look at that. First of all there are a lot of rent versus buy calculators
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:56.740]   on the internet. One of the core principles in the blog when I write about investments
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:04.860]   of any kind including this is that most of the investing world is made far more complicated
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.940]   than it needs to be made. The reason for that is that the more complicated things are the
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.700]   more people will throw up their hands and turn to the "experts" and the more the experts
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:22.420]   will be able to charge for their expertise to walk people through the maze. So I'm a
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:28.020]   big believer in keeping things absolutely as simple as they need to be on investments.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   I think when I look at these calculators they're great but some of them are just way more complicated
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.900]   than they functionally need to be. The other objection that I have to a lot of the ways
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:45.860]   that people figure this is it's an academic exercise rather than an exercise that looks
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:52.780]   at a person's real situation. What do I mean by that? Well if you're an academic and you're
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.340]   doing a study and you say, "You know what? I want to do a little research here and I
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:03.340]   want to figure out definitively is renting better than buying or vice versa?" Well you're
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:09.020]   going to construct an academic study and one of the things you're going to want to do is
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:15.700]   compare absolute apples to apples but that's not how people live. When I sold my company
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:21.780]   and sold my house and moved into the apartment where we live, it's not the same square footage
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:28.780]   and it's not the same location. It's apples to oranges but that's real life. So I don't
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:34.180]   care and I also, you can run the numbers, it happens somebody offered to rent my house
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.020]   at one point so I had a pretty good idea of what the rental was worth. So I can run the
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:43.700]   numbers looking about, "Okay, what if I sold this house and rented an equivalent house?"
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:48.060]   But in my real life, I don't care about that. I care about what if I sell this house in
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.740]   my case and I move to where I want to move. So anyway, with that little bit of background,
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.460]   we can walk through the numbers a bit if you'd like.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:04.460]   Yeah, absolutely and that's where I think ultimately I believe the fundamental foundation
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:12.900]   question that you have to start with in good financial planning is, "What do I want?"
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.940]   Depending on what you want, that's going to determine the decision that you make and
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:22.020]   there's no right or wrong unless you want something and your decision isn't helping
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.300]   you get that. So that's why the lifestyle stuff is so important but so is the opportunity
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.980]   cost. So yeah, go through the numbers here.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:37.620]   Okay. So basically, again, I think this should be very simple and hopefully you'll provide
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.060]   a link to this post so anybody who wants to look at it, the advisor can look at it and
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.780]   they can do that. Maybe it's easier to look at it black and white than just listening
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.380]   to us talk about it.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.300]   But basically, there's only four things you really have to think about in terms of what
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:56.340]   a house costs you. You have to think about opportunity cost and that's frequently one
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:02.580]   of the biggest. You have to consider utility cost, particularly in the northeast where
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.540]   we live. The heating oil is a big one so I include that. You have to think about the
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:13.220]   maintenance repair and insurance which I'll embalm together. You have to think about those
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:17.140]   kinds of costs and then you have to think about taxes.
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:23.620]   So if you look at our house, our house and as I sit here, I can't remember exactly what
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.700]   we sold it for and what we netted but as you know, when you sell a house, of course, that's
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.500]   not what you get after commissions and all the fees and everything. You get something
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.260]   significantly less than that. But at the time when I did this post and the house hadn't
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:43.540]   sold, I calculated that after going through all that, we would net $330,000 in the sale
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.940]   of our house and that's pretty close to where we came. I think we came in a little bit higher
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:55.180]   than that but I'm going to use the 330 number because that's where I ran these numbers in
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.180]   the post and it's just a little bit easier because the math works without my calculating
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.980]   it as I'm talking here.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.060]   So I sell the house as I did. I wind up and as I mentioned, my mortgage was paid so I
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:13.100]   owned it free and clear. After I paid all the fees, I got a check for $330,000. The
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:19.460]   first thing, so first question is, all right, if I have that $330,000 and it's no longer
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:24.900]   tied up in the house which was the opportunity cost we were talking about in the moment,
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.300]   what could it be earning for me?
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.900]   Well now you have to choose a proxy. You have to say, well if it's not tied up in the house,
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:37.620]   where would I have it invested? I happen to think real estate is a pretty good investment
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:44.220]   and the real estate vehicle I prefer is the REIT which is a real estate investment trust
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   because that's what R-E-I-T, REIT stands for. Vanguard has a great index of various REITs
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:00.260]   and it's VGSLX if anybody is interested. So that was my proxy.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:08.180]   Now this REIT fund, this REIT index fund pays a dividend of about 3.5% a year. So I say,
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:15.940]   okay, if I take my $330,000 and I invest it in VGSLX which by the way is exactly what
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:29.300]   I did after I sold the house, that will generate a 3.5% dividend and 3.5% of $330,000 is $11,555.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:36.340]   So now I am earning $11,555 that I didn't have coming to me when it was tied up in the
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:43.860]   house. That's the opportunity cost of owning that house. So that's cost number one.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:51.980]   Then I looked at the other three costs and they came up to about $18,000 altogether.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:57.500]   We're in a very expensive heating oil state as I alluded to so I got about $2,500 in annual
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:04.580]   heating costs based on the actual records of owning the house. It cost me about $7,000
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.580]   a year in maintenance, repair, insurance. So those things lumped together. And then
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:15.420]   my real estate taxes on the place we owned was $8,500. So we add those three together
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:23.300]   and you've got $18,000. So now I know with my opportunity costs and my actual cash costs,
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:31.620]   my house cost me $29,555. Now at the time, and I'll keep using this number, at the time
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.940]   I was guessing that the kind of apartment around here that we wanted would cost me about
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:43.020]   $2,000 a month. Actually, we found one that cost us much, much less than that. But we'll
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:49.580]   use the $2,000 as a number because that's what I was using when I did the post. So $2,000
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:59.020]   a month obviously is $24,000 a year in rent. You subtract 24 from 29,555 and I know now
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.460]   that my annual premium on average, and of course the cost of owning a house go up and
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:12.540]   down year to year, but on average it was costing me about $5,555 a year to live in the house.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:19.460]   So now I'm sitting here owning a house and I can say, "Well, is it worth the extra $5,500
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:25.860]   to live in this house or not?" Well, in my case, not only wasn't worth it, I mean when
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.420]   my daughter was young and I cared about the school district and the neighborhood and all
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.140]   that kind of stuff, yes, absolutely it was worth it. I was happy to pay it. Now she's
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:38.660]   off in college, now I don't care about that stuff, now I would prefer not to have all
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.180]   the hassles involved in owning a house. I prefer to have the flexibility and freedom
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:48.580]   of renting. I prefer to live back in the city where I can walk to places. It's not worth
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:55.700]   the extra $5,000 a year at all. In fact, I'd probably be willing to pay a premium to be
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:01.260]   rid of it. So there you have a real simple formula that allows you to make the decision
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:06.660]   that you're looking to analyze and think about. Does that make sense?
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:15.060]   It does. I think that putting numbers to it, I would challenge any person who's considering
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   decisions like this to put actual numbers to it. I want you to keep going with your
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.220]   post and then I'm going to come back and I'm going to pick all your numbers apart, not
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:27.820]   because they're wrong for you, because they're absolutely right for you, but I want to demonstrate
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   how they would change for somebody else depending on different choices that people would make.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:39.020]   But this is where each person has to do their own individual numbers. It's pretty staggering
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.660]   when you look at it like that and you realize that, yeah, you had a paid off house, which
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:49.060]   is what most people's dream is, had a paid off house and yet it's costing you $5,500
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:53.340]   a year more than going and living in an apartment that was more conducive to the lifestyle you
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:51:00.780]   wanted to live in, lower hassle, more flexible, just a better option for you.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:11.740]   It is and you do have to look at those things. But now, seeing as you've kind of suggested
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:18.420]   it, I'll kind of walk through the post here. But the next step that people should pay attention
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:25.460]   to and I think that probably some of our listeners will have already picked up on is the fact
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:31.300]   that, well, wait a second, that opportunity cost is not that when owning the house is
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:38.380]   not cash out of pocket and all of that rent that I've now taken on is absolutely cash
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:46.260]   out of pocket as was the $18,000. So if you turn around and you say, well, wait a second,
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:52.340]   if you look at it in terms of cash outlay, it actually does cost me more to live in the
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:57.100]   apartment now, right? Because my actual out of pocket cost for the house, weren't the
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:03.140]   29, I'm going to call it, I'm going to round it to $30,000 to make the conversation easier,
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:12.020]   wasn't the $30,000. In total, it was $18,000 and then plus $12,000 in opportunity cost,
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:17.460]   plus or minus. Of course, my rent, at least in the exercise we're doing is $24,000. So
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:24.340]   out of pocket cash flow is actually a $6,000 advantage to owning the house. I hope that's
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:31.100]   making sense so far. This is kind of for anybody who has a business background, this is EBITDA.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:36.340]   This is earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is what businesses
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:41.140]   do all the time. And cash flow is critical to running a business and it's critical to
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:47.940]   somebody owning a house. Now, you can turn that around and say, "Okay, my investment,
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:53.820]   my refund is now thrown off this $12,000 and that certainly helps." But setting that aside
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.780]   for a second, one of the things that you want to ask yourself is, "Do I have the cash flow
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:05.260]   resources to make this change?" Because a paid for house is going to require less cash
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:11.500]   coming out of your pocket, perhaps. I mean, you're more likely to be more cash positive
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:18.540]   than renting. Now, in my case, it didn't matter in the actual dollar value was a very real
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:24.860]   one that I was happy to have. As I say in the post, overall costs trump cash flow costs
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:29.540]   because they're more complete. But that's assuming that you can afford the cash flow.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.660]   And that's true in owning your house versus renting. It's also true as any business person
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.420]   will tell you in running a business. I mean, if you run out of cash, you run out of business.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:46.300]   >> It's also true paying off a mortgage early. So if you say, "I've got excess funds. Should
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:52.340]   I pay off a mortgage or should I invest the money instead and which is going to be a better
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:54:00.140]   use of the dollar?" A lot of that comes down to emotion and cash flow. So if somebody is
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:05.780]   going to actually invest the money, many times that may be better, but they're still going
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:11.260]   to have that money, that cash coming out of their pocket. And this is where if somebody
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   is potentially maybe a low income earner, kind of on the edge, and you said you have
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.660]   an opportunity and their jobs are unstable, maybe, there could be a tremendous peace of
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:24.660]   mind that could come by not having that cash flow deficit. But if somebody feels good about
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.500]   their income, they have other reserves to draw on, then they can handle the cash flow
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.060]   difference in favor of the total net cost difference.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:37.420]   >> Of course, the other side of that is that if the person is owning the house free and
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:43.460]   clear and is worried about their income, they're also tied to that location. And that's a very
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:49.020]   dangerous position to be in. And you look at, as I'm sure most people are aware of,
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:59.060]   the fact that Detroit just defaulted and services are up and taxes are going up. And if you
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:07.460]   own a house in Detroit, you're in a world of hurt. And so, yeah, location is a very
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.900]   risky, it's one of the things that makes owning a house a very risky thing. And it's one of
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:16.180]   the, looking at it from a purely financial point of view, and I understand that buying
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.780]   a house, I mean, I did it myself, as I've already said, is more than just looking at
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:26.540]   numbers. But just for a moment, looking at it from a purely financial point of view,
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:33.340]   not only should you not buy a house unless it's less money than renting, but it should
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.340]   be significantly, in my opinion, significantly less money than renting to compensate you
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.540]   for the risks that you're taking on with that investment.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:49.300]   >> Absolutely. That's a good point. Also, there's something that you point out, I think
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:54.380]   that a lot of people don't point out, don't realize, and it goes back to your roots versus
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:56:02.980]   Wings Post, an example. Many people don't think about the power of what the equity in
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:10.300]   a home could buy for them in terms of lifestyle. So, a $330,000 house, assume for a moment
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.940]   that someone has no other assets and investments, and using the numbers that you gave, and I'm
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:23.460]   going to use $12,000 for convenient numbers, even though the actual answer is $11,555.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:30.180]   But let's say that that portfolio could throw off $12,000. It can throw off that $12,000
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.260]   under the scenario you gave without invading principle and purely based on dividends, which
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:41.060]   means it's perpetual as long as the dividend rate on that fund stays high, which means
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:46.620]   that they can take and they can rent for $1,000 a month anywhere in the world. So, instead
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.980]   of it being forever, exactly. When you get to retirement planning, which is where you're
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   in the early stages of retirement, unless you change your mind, of course, think about
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.380]   a lot of people. You have to consider the fact that many people's dreams is to have
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.980]   a paid-off home when they enter into retirement, but yet many people have dreams of doing things
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:15.060]   like traveling in retirement. The paid-off home may be a great asset, but every single
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:20.540]   month, no matter where you are, it's tied to the same piece of real estate, whereas
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:25.740]   if it were an investment asset, that cash flow will follow you wherever you want to
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:36.220]   be. This ties into your buddy, Matt Fientist. One of the things that he's into is slow
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:41.460]   travel. This concept of instead of just simply taking a whirlwind two-week trip or three-week
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:49.220]   trip, I can simply move more slowly and live like a local. People say, "Where do I get
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:54.420]   the money to travel?" You're living in it. Maybe you should consider turning it into
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.500]   cash flow instead of a roof over your head.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:02.100]   >> I personally wouldn't do this because I think there are headaches and worries that
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.660]   are involved in it that I wouldn't want to have, but there are some people who would
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.220]   say, "That's right. What I'm going to do is I'm going to keep my house, my paid-for
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.260]   house, but I will rent it out, and that will be the cash flow." If you're of the correct
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:21.620]   temperament and your house is a reasonable kind of rental property, that too can work.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:26.540]   As we've already discussed, there are a lot of different solutions. Personally, I would
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:32.900]   be uncomfortable in retirement having that big a chunk of money tied up in one location
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.700]   and one asset.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:42.500]   The other point, by the way, that I want to make before we move on from that is that sometimes
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:47.260]   people will say to me when I do this analysis, "Well, yeah, but the house might go up in
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:54.700]   value." Well, it might, but the real estate fund also has the potential to go up in value.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:59:01.540]   The real estate fund is absolutely a much more conservative investment than an individual
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:10.380]   house in that it is spread across a huge range of real estate by definition, whereas a house,
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:18.580]   any house, is focused on one piece of property in one specific location. It's a very -- I'm
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.900]   drawing a blank on the term I'm looking for, but it's a very focused kind of investment
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:31.340]   when you own a house. If you're lucky, that might mean that you outperform the fund. Just
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:37.060]   like picking an individual stock might outperform an index fund over some period of time. But
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:42.220]   if you're unlucky, or over a more extended period of time, you run into a much greater
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:48.180]   risk that it will underperform the broader-based index of REITs.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:56.980]   >> Also, you have a specific asset allocation strategy. From reading your blog, I know you
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:02.740]   stick to a strategy 50% stock, 25% real estate, 25% bonds. Is that right?
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   >> That's correct.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.780]   >> When you sold your house --
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:11.260]   >> By the way, I do that -- I don't necessarily recommend that for everybody at all times,
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   but for somebody my --
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.260]   >> I lost you there.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.260]   >> Can you hear me all right?
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.260]   >> Now you're back.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:26.740]   >> What I was saying is that allocation you just described is in fact what I personally
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:33.620]   do, but it's also a function of my age and my retirement status, not necessarily what
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:40.380]   I recommend for everybody. When I -- back until a few years ago, I was strictly in the
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:46.980]   stock index fund, because that's the more powerful growth tool. But as you get older,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:53.860]   sometimes you want or you need more stability. You need to smooth out the ride a little bit.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:59.700]   You want to protect yourself against the truly awful things that very rarely happen, like
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.180]   a Great Depression, which was deflationary, which is what bonds help you with, or the
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:11.180]   kind of thing that some countries have gone through, like Germany in the '30s, the runaway
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:18.500]   rampant inflation, which is what hopefully real estate will hedge against.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.540]   >> That's a rational way to do it. I think a lot of Americans could learn from that,
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:32.860]   because I know there are many people who have $100,000 of equity in a home, and yet a much
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:37.340]   -- they haven't decided that -- let's just say they have $100,000 of equity in a home,
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:44.060]   and frankly, I don't need to be too cautious. Many people have $20,000 in stocks. I don't
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.780]   think they decided that I want to have this 80 -- whatever the number is there -- 80%
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.420]   in real estate and 20% in stock, and yet that's what they have.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.900]   In today's culture, if you look at the consumer confidence numbers and things like that, you
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:06.500]   see that as goes the fortunes of the real estate market with Americans overexposed to
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:14.340]   real estate, so goes the national sentiment. In Florida, where I live, the dramatic decline
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.500]   in real estate values or prices and a dramatic increase over recent times in real estate
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.700]   prices. It definitely affects the national mood, and the reason is because people are
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.300]   so exposed to real estate as an asset class.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:37.420]   >> Yeah, absolutely. When it collapses, it caught everybody or a lot of people off guard
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:43.180]   and it cost them a lot of money. Because it tends to be a leveraged investment, as we
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:49.860]   talked about earlier. They'd lost all of their money. They wound up owning something that
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:56.500]   wasn't worth what they owed on it. That's a really ugly situation to be in.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.820]   >> You owned your house free and clear. I did not.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:06.060]   >> I did not initially. I borrowed money to begin with, but at some point, I don't know,
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.500]   maybe five, six years ago, I decided to pay it off.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.820]   >> How would you have done this analysis if you did have a mortgage?
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:20.380]   >> Let's take a look at that. I was going to do something else first, but we'll jump
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:30.940]   down to that. Let me just find my numbers on that here. Yeah, here we go. I'm just going
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.780]   to read through this a little bit, because when I wrote it, I was probably a little clearer
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:42.500]   than I can actually verbalize it now. What about mortgage interest payments? If you have
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:48.260]   a mortgage, and many do, you simply need to add an extra couple of numbers to the formula.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:54.820]   We'll take a look here. Suppose I had a 20% equity, or if I put 20% down on the house,
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:04:03.140]   and using my $330,000 house as the example, so 20% of that is $66,000. I've got an 80%
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:13.500]   mortgage then for the balance, which is $264,000. Now my opportunity cost is $2,310. We get
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:22.380]   that, and we're using the same refund. That's 3.5% dividend that the $66,000 could have
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.340]   been earning if we didn't pull it out and put it as a down payment on the house. Now
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.780]   we have a little bit more in the way of cash expenses. We still have $2,500 in heating
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:37.460]   oil. We've still got the $7,000 in maintenance, repair, and insurance. We've still got to
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:43.820]   pay the $8,500 in real estate tax. Now we also have a mortgage loan. By the way, I simplified
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:49.180]   this number. As most people know, when you make your mortgage payment, it's a combination
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:54.340]   of the interest you owe on the loan and, at least initially, a very small portion of paying
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:59.700]   off the equity. That changes over time. If you pay it down, you're paying less and less
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:05.460]   interest, more and more equity, until after 15 or 30 years or whatever your term is, you're
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.780]   finally done with the thing. I'm going to assume that we've got a 4% loan, and I'm just
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:21.500]   going to look at interest. 4% on that $264,000 is $15,120. I'm going to estimate that as
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:27.060]   our interest payments on the loan. Now the other thing that comes into play, of course,
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.380]   is that when you have a mortgage, you do get a tax deduction, or at least potentially you
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:37.100]   get a tax deduction. I say potentially because there are a lot of things that can determine
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:43.060]   whether or not you actually get one and how much it will be. What your tax bracket is,
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:50.980]   is one, and I put that in here. For the sake of this analysis here, I picked a 25% tax
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.580]   bracket, which, by the way, is a pretty high tax bracket. The 15% tax bracket goes up to
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:02.460]   about $70,000 these days. Then if you look at all the standard deductions and exemptions
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:07.740]   you might have, if you're married and you've got a couple of kids, you're earning over
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:14.700]   $100,000 before you move into this 25% tax bracket. We'll use it as an example.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.980]   The other caution I want to make, and I'm kind of digressing a little bit here on mortgage
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:26.300]   deductions because there's so much myth built around them, is that the standard deduction
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:31.900]   at the moment, which is the deduction you get before you itemize, for a married couple
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:40.900]   is something on the order of $11,700. It's a very large number. Until you have enough
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:47.460]   deductions to itemize, which means more than that standard deduction, more than $11,700,
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.540]   having a mortgage isn't going to help you one way or the other. It's also not going
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:58.100]   to help you except to the extent it exceeds that amount of money, unless you have other
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.820]   deductions that take you up there.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:04.340]   What do I mean by that? Let's suppose that you've got this $15,000, and I'm going to
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:10.660]   round it, $15,000 in interest that you can deduct. What you're really able to deduct
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:18.220]   is that $15,000 minus $11,700, which was your standard deduction. Now, if you give charitable
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.780]   contributions or you have other kinds of deductions, your real estate taxes, that all comes into
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:28.580]   it. Little digression as to why there's a bit of myth around this whole tax deduction.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   For the sake of running the numbers, I assume you're in the 25% bracket. I assume that you've
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:39.900]   got enough other deductions to take you over that standard deduction. You're going to get
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:54.620]   100% of that $15,120 as a deduction. That's going to save you, at the 25% bracket, $5,905.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:08:03.380]   So now, what we have is a total cost of $29,525 to own and operate the house.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.860]   Versus $24,000 to rent.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:12.420]   What's interesting to me when I ran these numbers is how close that number is to the
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:20.500]   number owning at mortgage-free, which was $29,555. So, I mean, it's within a handful
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:27.580]   of dollars of being the same. Versus the $24,000 in rent. So again, you're looking at a little
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:35.380]   better than $5,500 premium. In this particular example, my house and my projected rent to
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   live in that house.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.380]   I hope that makes sense.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:46.380]   >> Trevor: Yeah, it does. I was just looking at the numbers here again. I'd encourage people,
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:50.900]   when you're done driving or whatever, go click through to this post. It's worth reading.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:56.620]   It is definitely interesting because one of the reasons why I especially like this article
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:03.020]   here is that you did take into consideration the tax deduction savings. You were generous
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.020]   with your numbers.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:10.620]   >> Tom: Thank you. That's a good point. I was trying to do it on the generous side.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:15.300]   Not all those caveats I just put in as I was talking about it are not in the post because
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:21.060]   that would kind of muddy the water. But the truth is that the tax deduction for most people
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:25.060]   would not be as generous as I indicated in the post.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:29.820]   >> Trevor: That's where, in our tax code, many people don't truly understand how the
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.260]   tax code works. But if you look at a Schedule A and you say, "What are my deductions?"
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:41.540]   For many people, the major deduction is mortgage interest deduction and charitable deduction.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:47.380]   There are other deductions allowed depending on your situation. But those are the primary
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.020]   ones that people jump to.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:54.700]   If we just ignore, for the sake of simplicity, if we just ignore real estate tax deduction
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.900]   or if we just ignore everything else and just focus on mortgage interest deduction, with
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:08.020]   an $11,000 standard deduction, that means that if you were only deducting your interest,
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:13.740]   your interest payments need to be in excess of $11,000 for you to be worth, to come out
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.660]   ahead doing anything but the standard deduction.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:21.300]   So if you calculate your mortgage payment, we're talking at minimum, I can't remember
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:26.100]   my calculator, I could run it, it would take, what is that, $200,000 loan?
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:33.020]   >> Tom: It's a pretty big loan. The other thing is, the important thing for people to
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.820]   understand is that until you get past that standard deduction, let's round it up to $12,000
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:42.500]   to make the math easy, you don't get anything for your mortgage.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:49.900]   So if your mortgage interest is $15,000, you're actually getting a tax deduction on $3,000
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:54.780]   that would be above and beyond what you would have with the standard deduction not owning
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   the house.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:04.340]   >> So I just ran the numbers on a 4% interest rate and I say 30 year loan, fixed rate, 4%,
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:10.660]   you would need a $210,000 mortgage balance for your total even payment to be higher than
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:15.700]   $1,000 a month, $12,000, and I'm assuming in the beginning that most of that is interest.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:23.900]   So those are rough numbers, but if your mortgage balance is not in excess of $210,000, ignoring
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:28.620]   other deductions you can take on the Schedule A, you're going to be in a situation where
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.740]   you're going to be in standard deduction territory.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.660]   Many people take the standard deduction thinking, "I'm getting my real estate deduction."
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.260]   Well, no, it's just you handed your CPA, your tax preparer your taxes and he said, "Oh,
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.900]   we'll run this calculation, this one saves you $5,000, this one saves you $11,000 on
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.260]   your standard deduction, we'll take the standard deduction."
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:54.740]   >> You know, I actually have a post in the works about this very thing because you heard
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:12:02.420]   me already refer to the real estate tax deduction as a myth, and it is a bit of a myth in the
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:04.420]   way it is presented to people.
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.660]   It's a reality in that there is such a thing and for some people, including me, because
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:14.540]   of my income and also the other thing that I hesitate using the word "helped" because
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.140]   real estate taxes around here are so high and they are also deductible.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.780]   So when you pay $8,500 a year in real estate taxes, which I did, well that gets you up
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:31.020]   to a level where you get over that $11,700 standard deduction pretty quickly with your
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.020]   mortgage interest.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:37.060]   But setting that aside, there is this myth that is created that, "Oh, you know, when
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:41.180]   you own a house, you're going to get this great tax deduction, that's going to save
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.380]   you thousands of dollars."
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.180]   Well maybe, depends on you, depends on your tax bracket, depends on what other deductions
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.740]   you have, depends on where you live, depends on your real estate taxes, depends on all
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.740]   kinds of things.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:58.260]   And I suspect most people, if they really looked at what they were getting, weren't
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.340]   getting what they really thought they were getting.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:05.260]   And then if you go to, by the way, the very higher income people, that deduction fades
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.180]   away.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:12.660]   So there is kind of a sweet spot where if you're making enough money but not too much
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:17.620]   money and you have a big enough house but not too big a house, maybe you get a pretty
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.820]   sweet deduction, but maybe not.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.340]   >> Trevor: No, and that's exactly the point.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:32.580]   So when you go to the phase outs on income, if my memory is correct, you can deduct interest
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.820]   on up to a million dollar principal mortgage and $100,000 on a second mortgage or home
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:41.020]   equity loan as long as it's used on the property.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.020]   Is that the right number?
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   Do you remember?
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.020]   >> Mike: I'm not sure.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.460]   You're more up to date on it than I am.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.700]   >> Trevor: I think it's a million and a hundred thousand.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.100]   So if you say, "Okay, someone has a million dollar mortgage," and that's probably like,
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.740]   off the top of my head, it's probably about five, something like five to six thousand
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.960]   dollars a month at a four or five percent interest rate.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.140]   So there you've got $60,000 a year of payments and when you do $60,000 a year of payments,
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:12.460]   now you're into a significant amount of that interest.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.460]   >> Mike: You're in that sweet spot.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.140]   >> Trevor: Exactly, but you've still got to look at the income limit.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.120]   So the key is running the numbers yourself for your situation.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.740]   I would challenge listeners.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.060]   I've asked people from time to time, maybe you have too, Jim.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:31.480]   So interesting, I've asked people, "How much tax did you pay last year?"
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.360]   And I have learned, and I'm just asking friends and other people, I have learned that most
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.400]   people can't say the number.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.960]   They usually say, "Oh, how much did I get?
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.040]   Oh, I got back $3,000," or "Oh, I owed a thousand bucks."
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.800]   But very few people ever look at the number, which I'm going to look up while we're talking
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.800]   here, I'm going to look up the 1040.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.320]   I think it's line like 61 or something.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.940]   Very few people know what the actual number of tax was that they paid.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:06.580]   So I challenge listeners, go back and look at how much actual tax did you pay, and also
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.980]   look and say, "Calculate that as a percentage of income and figure out what your actual
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   effective tax rate is."
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   And with that number, you'll be able to run your own actual calculations, which will be
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   hugely helpful.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.520]   And I think most people will be surprised that their tax rate is probably not as high
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.520]   as they think it is.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.520]   - It's really not.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:33.460]   - And, you know, I mean, as I alluded to earlier, and again, it's a little complex because tax
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.580]   rates vary depending on whether you're married.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:41.660]   But if you're married and you have a couple of kids, as I said earlier, unless you're
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:46.920]   making end to six figures, your tax rate is 15%.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.160]   On the federal level, now, granted there's state and local taxes that all add to that,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:58.120]   but on the federal level, it's probably more modest than you think it is.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.320]   But the other thing I wanted to do before we go on is I also did another post.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.760]   I have an interest in Ecuador and I have kind of toyed with the idea of at some point moving
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.600]   to Ecuador.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:18.080]   And I did, after I did the post we've been talking about on rent versus own and running
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   the numbers, I did a follow-up post having come back from a trip I made to Ecuador last
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.040]   fall and I looked at some property down there and I thought it'd be interesting to run the
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.800]   numbers on property down there.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.760]   And if you'll indulge me, I'll share an example.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.600]   And this is an example where actually the numbers indicate that it would be less expensive
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.100]   to own than to rent.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.480]   So if you're interested, I'll do it.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.120]   - I am, keep going.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.680]   - So one of the, I'll just pick one, we can do others if you want, but one of them, there's
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.600]   a, my favorite city in Ecuador as it happens is a city called Cuenca.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.600]   And one of the places I looked at in Cuenca was a condo.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.200]   And it's a two bedroom, two and a half bath condo, it's got a veranda, it's about 1500
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   square feet.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.280]   And the asking price is $162,000.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:20.520]   And based on what I could ferret out, and I'm hedging myself a little bit because it's
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:24.360]   hard to be sure about exact things.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.880]   Based on what I could ferret out, to rent this same condo would cost about $800.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:36.840]   Now maybe if you're buying it, you could negotiate a lower price, maybe you could negotiate a
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:44.760]   lower rent, but we'll use the asking price and the stated rent value for running our
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   numbers.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.160]   So we say, okay, let's start out, let's assume that we're gonna pay cash for this thing,
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:57.440]   so we've got, which would be my situation, so that's the situation I'm using.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.480]   So I take $162,000 out of my refund, and I buy this condo.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:10.840]   And now of course, I have an opportunity cost because that $162,000 had been earning me
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:18.520]   at that 3.5% that we talked about earlier, $5,670 a year.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:26.200]   So immediately I have $5,670 a year poorer by virtue of buying this thing.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:34.760]   Now the annual, excuse me, I just had to take a drink of water there.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:41.000]   The annual cash expenses, because this is in Ecuador, are significantly less.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.480]   There are no heating and air conditioning costs because there is no heating and air
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.240]   conditioning because the climate is perfect.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.240]   Buildings in Ecuador don't have heat or air conditioning, they're not needed.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.640]   So that cost goes to zero.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:01.560]   The homeowners association fee on this particular condo is $94 a month.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.080]   That's $1,128 a year.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.920]   And the real estate taxes, remember for a second, my real estate taxes here in New Hampshire
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.880]   were $8,500 a year.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:20.480]   The real estate taxes on this condo for the year are $124.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.880]   So obviously the cash costs have come way, way down.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:32.400]   So the total cost of owning and operating this condo is $6,922.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:39.680]   Most of that, $5,670 of it is in that opportunity cost.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:48.520]   The actual out-of-pocket cash cost is $1,252 a year.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.840]   So a little slightly better than $100 a month.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.880]   I mean it's just much different and you look then at what it would cost to rent that place
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.280]   and that, as we decided, was $800 a month.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.200]   $800 times 12 is $9,600.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:12.680]   So if you subtract from $9,600 the cost of owning it, which again was the $6,922, now
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:20.640]   you're looking at an annual premium to rent and that premium is $2,678.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:26.280]   Do you think that that may, just as I'm listening to those numbers, do you think that might
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.280]   be partially due to the difference in the financing system between Ecuador and the United
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   States?
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.520]   In that the United States, just about anybody who's reasonably credit worthy can borrow
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.840]   money for a home.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.480]   I haven't been to Ecuador yet, but many of the countries that I've traveled in, in Central
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:50.640]   and South America, the financing system there is much more stringent and so many people
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.200]   who are buying are cash buyers or are wealthier.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.960]   Do you think that might be one of the factors?
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.200]   David Morgan: Well I don't know if it's a factor.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:06.920]   It is certainly what you described is a real thing, but I'm not sure it's a factor with
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   these numbers.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:14.040]   I mentioned early in our conversation when we were talking about the depression and how
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:19.160]   mortgages became popular in this country and why, I mentioned that there were parts of
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:25.080]   the world where people routinely, if they're going to own a house, they pay cash for it.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.080]   In Ecuador and a lot of South America for that matter, it falls into that category.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.400]   There is more as I understand it, and by the way I'm way out of my area of expertise talking
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:41.040]   about this, so this is just my basic understanding from conversations I've had is that there
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.280]   is mortgage money available.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.720]   It is very expensive.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:52.480]   Let me define that by saying the percents I've heard are 17, 18, 20% for a mortgage,
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.920]   so very, very expensive and lots of money put down, so most people tend not to do that.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:05.880]   So it is a market where if you're going to buy, you're probably going to be paying cash,
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:11.700]   so you just don't have the option of mortgages, but I don't think that necessarily affects
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.400]   the cost structure we described.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.680]   It might serve in tapping down the value of property because one of the functions of having
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:26.520]   readily available money to borrow is it tends to drive up the cost of an asset, so one of
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.400]   the reasons that houses have gotten so expensive in this country is because it's become easy
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.360]   to borrow money to buy them.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.200]   If mortgage money didn't exist, houses would be a lot less expensive.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.560]   Simply supply and demand, there'd be a lot fewer people buying them.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:50.160]   >> Yeah, and it also would, where my mind would go, would be that when you hear numbers
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.080]   like that, you immediately go and say, "Well, let me consider this from the perspective
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.080]   of an investor."
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.640]   I know in the past you also have been a real estate investor in individual properties,
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   right?
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   >> A long time ago.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.680]   >> Okay, so that's where many people, this is one of their strategies, which is a fine
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.880]   strategy towards financial independence, is owning investment properties.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.560]   When you get into spreads like that, where you can command very high rents as compared
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:20.800]   to the purchase prices, that can be a great place to consider that situation.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.520]   It's unique down here in South Florida where I live.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:33.640]   We're actually in a unique market because the rental prices are substantially higher.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.600]   Rents are in high demand because a lot of rental units were not being built, and also
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.960]   a lot of people that were formerly homeowners are now renters.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.440]   The rental market is very substantial.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:49.840]   The numbers, there's an interesting spread, and it's changing because the market down
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.880]   here is different than a lot of the country.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.520]   It changes month by month, but right now the house prices have been in the past a little
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:04.720]   bit flat, held down by financing the challenges of getting properties appraised, but yet the
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   rents were increasing.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:11.000]   It's actually been a really good time, not just because of low interest rates, dip in
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.520]   the market type of thing, but just rent versus own calculations here in South Florida have
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.520]   been different.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520]   The market dynamic.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.080]   >>Ted Dixon Well, you know, and that sort of goes back
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.960]   to one of the fundamental principles that we've been talking about here, and that is
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:30.800]   the fundamental principle is not don't ever own a house, which I think some people who
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:37.080]   read the essay that you read for our audience and didn't read anything else I've ever written
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.320]   might have come to that conclusion.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:46.480]   The principle is to understand what the numbers say about the house you're looking to buy
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   at that particular moment in the particular location where you're looking at it.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   And I also want to back up, and you heard me say earlier that looking at property and
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:03.800]   owning a house, or in this case owning a condo, from a strictly a financial point of view,
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:10.080]   I would want it to not only be less expensive than renting, I would want it to be significantly
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.080]   less expensive to compensate me for the risks.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.440]   Now let's take Ecuador as an example, but before our listeners all charge down to Ecuador
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.440]   and buy condos.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:27.480]   You know, we were talking about the price of this place being $162,000 and the rent
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   being $800.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.560]   One of the challenges if you're going to buy property in Ecuador is that there is not a
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.000]   multiple listing service.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.560]   And so the price of a property, the asking price of a property is surprisingly difficult
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.320]   to nail down.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:53.560]   It's very possible that had you gone to look at this condo that I just described with a
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:01.280]   different realtor an hour after I was there, they might have told you this is $142,000.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.340]   They might have told you it was $180,000.
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.800]   So you have to be very, very careful when you're buying property in Ecuador because
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:17.120]   it's very hard to know what the going price really is.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.280]   And that of course, you know, it takes time and experience and what have you.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.240]   There are a lot of Americans that I met down there charging down, everything seems cheap
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:32.760]   and they buy right away without understanding that what seems cheap to them might be significantly
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.240]   overvalued and they have to remember that when they go back home to California or to
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.400]   New Hampshire where I live, when the time comes to sell this condo that they just bought
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.680]   in Ecuador, they're not going to be selling it in California.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.200]   They're going to be selling it in Ecuador.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:55.120]   And if they pay too much for it because the price is very flexible in that part of the
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:01.280]   world, they're going to have to find another foreigner to pay that price.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.680]   So you definitely, it's not as easy as the numbers make it sound.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.720]   You need to look at more than just the numbers when you're looking at buying property in
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   Ecuador.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720]   There are some unique considerations.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.120]   And it's the same thing with rent.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.920]   If you went to rent that place, you know, I go in and they say it's $800 a month, you
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.360]   might come in behind me and because your agent is a different agent, it might be a thousand
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.760]   or might be 600.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:37.080]   So it's, you know, you have to know the market that you're operating in.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.080]   That's great advice.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.280]   Prior to going into the mortgage, you had something that you wanted to talk about?
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.560]   I got a couple of other things as we kind of get close to wrapping up.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.760]   But did we talk about what you wanted to talk about?
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.880]   If I had something else, I don't remember at the moment.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.120]   So we'll roll into whatever you want to talk about.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   All right.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   So I wanted to give just a couple of quick things.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:04.200]   First, I wanted to talk about a couple of quick things on taxes.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.620]   So advantages and disadvantages.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:11.800]   You had an interesting comment on your blog.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.600]   And the commenter was asking you about your tax calculations.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.040]   So the major tax calculation, just for the audience, number one is mortgage interest
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.640]   tax deduction.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.840]   That's valuable when you own a home.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:32.640]   But on the flip side, if you were an investor, you could take a deduction for depreciation.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.720]   And then, so that's one option.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:43.760]   Disadvantage to owning the house as a rental unit is that your appreciation is going to
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:50.640]   be taxed when you sell the house, unless you do a 1035 exchange into a, sorry, for real
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640]   estate, a 1031, a 1035.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   I can't remember.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   I think it's 1031.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:00.440]   I don't recall either, but what you're talking about is if you don't actually sell it, if
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.240]   you can exchange it for another piece of real estate.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.240]   Yeah, a like kind exchange.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.640]   I always get 1035 and 1031 confused.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.720]   So you do a like kind exchange into another property, but the advantage is that in the
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:23.240]   US, if you are able to own the property and live in it, you can defer up to $250,000 of
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.640]   gain for an individual and not its tax rate or $500,000 for a married couple.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:34.800]   So this brings into play a couple of like opportunities that we could potentially exploit
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.360]   the tax code, which could be helpful for some people to factor into their thinking.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:45.440]   So first of all, you had an interesting comment on your blog about a mental exercise that
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:51.760]   you ran back in the days of being a landlord and a renter at the same time, where you thought
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.080]   about it would be better if you just rented to somebody else and that they rented from
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080]   you.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.680]   Explain kind of the thought process that people could just understand that conceptually and
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.400]   what your experience was like being a renter and a landlord at the same time.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:13.440]   You are testing my memory because that goes back probably 30 years when I was doing that.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.680]   But as best I recall, you alluded to it a couple of times.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:27.360]   One of the other pieces of pushback I got from the post that you read was, "Well, what
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.720]   if I own an investment property?"
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.320]   Investment properties are different and they are different for a lot of reasons.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:37.600]   They are different because they are treated differently in the tax code.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   You mentioned that you can depreciate them.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.680]   And they are different because they are generating income.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.320]   Just like my refund generates income, in a way my house doesn't.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.360]   Well, an investment house does.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:31:00.080]   And for what it's worth, before I go further, I think that investment real estate is if
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:07.480]   you are prepared, if you do your homework and you do it well, investment real estate
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.880]   can be a very lucrative thing to do.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.920]   What a lot of people seem to miss, or at least they miss in terms of the conversation of
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:22.640]   whether it's a better investment than mutual funds or some other investment, is that investment
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.680]   real estate is also a part-time job.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:30.480]   And so if you are going to compare it to other kinds of investments, you have to say, "Well,
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.720]   okay, I'm going to own this rental house and that's going to be a better investment than
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.720]   your mutual fund.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.240]   Well, okay, I'm going to own this mutual fund and I'm going to get a part-time job fixing
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.560]   cars because I have that skill.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.720]   Actually, I don't have that skill, but it's an example."
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:50.760]   So you have to understand that for most people, when they go into small-scale rental investments,
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.640]   they're also taking on a part-time job.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.440]   If you want to do that, it can be a great way to go.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.840]   I never particularly enjoyed that part of it, which is one of the reasons that I'm not
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.320]   a real estate investor anymore.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:10.000]   But when I was investing, I was living in Chicago and I accepted a job promotion that
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.320]   moved me to Cleveland.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:18.080]   And so I left the properties behind and when I moved to Cleveland, because I didn't particularly
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:22.920]   want to own a house and my wife and I didn't have any children, we rented.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.880]   We rented a beautiful condo that somebody else owned and we had a wonderful view over
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.800]   Lake Erie and it was terrific.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.680]   So I had all the advantages of renting, all the carefree lifestyle of renting at the same
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.400]   time.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.480]   I had this real estate investment, which was doing pretty well for me, and I had tenants
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.120]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:47.880]   So it was kind of the best of all worlds, but it was still a bit of a headache and a
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   bit of a hassle and a bit of a concern being long distance that, "No, it doesn't bother
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880]   everybody.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   It bothered me."
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:01.240]   So now I'm much more content to own the REIT Mutual Fund and not have the hands-on real
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   estate.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   >> Yeah.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.040]   And the other nice thing about the REIT Mutual Fund, it's liquid.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.960]   You want out of real estate, one click of the mouse and you're gone versus 5% coming
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.800]   and going and however many months on the market, in your case, three years on the market.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.320]   >> And you know, people, well, first of all, it wasn't consistently three years on the
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   market.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.920]   We went on and off, but three years in the present.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:31.440]   But that's a great point, Joshua, because people don't often appreciate the value of
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.480]   liquidity.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.680]   And there's enormous value in having liquidity.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:42.880]   And the other comment I'd like to make on that is that I think one of the reasons that
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:48.360]   people have it in their heads that their house is an embedded investment than, say, a total
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:58.840]   stock market index fund, is that on any given day, you can go to your computer and you can
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:06.160]   click on that fund and you can find out exactly, to the penny, what the shares you own in that
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.200]   fund are worth at that particular moment in time.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.200]   That's kind of a cool--
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   >> And I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.800]   What they're worth based upon the fact that that price is simply reflecting what somebody
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.760]   is willing to pay you at this particular time.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.840]   >> Right, but that is by definition what they're worth.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.080]   What anything's worth is by definition what somebody is willing to pay you.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.080]   >> Correct.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.640]   >> And just making the only reason I do think that that's something a lot of people don't
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.480]   think about, because they look at that price and they say, "Well, that's the ultimate underlying
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.480]   value."
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.360]   And I would say, "No, that's just simply what they're worth as reflected by the current
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.360]   price."
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.280]   But the underlying value of the investment in the world that you're talking about is
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.920]   going to be driven partly by what someone's willing to pay you, but also by the profits
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:47.920]   of the underlying companies.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.360]   Sorry, that's a tangent that we get down.
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   >> Right.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.360]   And that's an important point.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.640]   And actually, I can't think of which one, but on one of my posts I talk about that.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.840]   The analogy I use is a glass of beer.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.920]   You have the beer and then you have the foam on top.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:11.360]   And the beer itself is the real, hardcore, tangible value of a stock, and in my particular
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.880]   what I was talking about.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:19.280]   And the foam on top is all the trading noise that goes on day to day over the course.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:25.200]   And most frequently, your beer is in a mug so you can't see exactly how much foam there
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:28.400]   is compared to how much beer.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   But anyway, backing up.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   >> I wish I hadn't interrupted you.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   >> Yeah, no, that's just it.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   But backing up to it for a second.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:41.840]   So if you own the Total Stock Market Index Fund, which is my preference, BTSAX, you
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.440]   will know at almost any given point precisely what somebody will pay you for it.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.000]   Let's all use that terminology.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.280]   What it's worth, what somebody will pay you for it at that moment in time.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.440]   And that's a cool thing to know, but it can also be a scary thing to know.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:02.820]   Because if it bumps up tomorrow or for the next week, you'll have this feeling of euphoria.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:08.240]   If it drifts down for some reason over the next day or week or months or whatever, it
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.040]   can be terrifying.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:14.240]   And so you tend to see that as a risky thing.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:20.080]   The truth is that from point A today to point B, say, 10 years out, it is almost inevitably
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.800]   going to be much higher and it will make you a lot of money, probably much more money than
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800]   your house will.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.600]   Now, you look at your house.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:32.840]   You cannot in any precise way know what your house is worth day to day.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:33.840]   Now it fluctuates.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.000]   The reality in the real world, it fluctuates day to day.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.600]   I mean, your house today is not worth exactly what it's going to be worth tomorrow or the
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   day before.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.160]   So it does fluctuate, but there's no way that the market can precisely tell you what
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.760]   that fluctuation is going on is.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.840]   And therefore it appears not to be there.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.440]   And it appears to be a much more stable kind of investment.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.680]   And I think that's one of the reasons that people are so psychologically comfortable
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.680]   owning houses.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.800]   Intellectually, they may understand all the risks that we talked about in the post you
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.120]   read.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.200]   But emotionally, because it doesn't seem to vary unless we get this huge down draft
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.200]   that we had where just everybody was aware that their house was going down in value because
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.640]   they could see it in their neighbors.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.440]   But most people day to day don't know or care what their house is worth.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.720]   And if they did, there's no real precise way to look at it very day to day.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.680]   I mean, yeah, you can look at similar houses, but that's not the same level of precision
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.040]   that you get in the reporting that's in the stock market.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:43.320]   And therefore that mutual fund looks a lot more volatile than the house in ways that
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320]   it really isn't.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320]   Does that make any sense?
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.800]   >> It absolutely does.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.560]   And I think that's key.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:56.000]   One of the biggest influences on people's decisions is, I mean, it's a whole study of
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   behavioral finance.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:06.560]   And I think that you are accurately assessing one of the major differences between real
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.680]   estate and stocks.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:13.040]   And it comes down to how people perceive risk.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:18.760]   Some people would -- you would probably be one to say who would be able to accept that,
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:24.640]   hey, owning one house in one town in one neighborhood, that's incredibly risky.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.040]   Both from something happens to the neighborhood, something happens from that to that house,
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.280]   something happens to this region.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   That's very risky.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.600]   >> Something happens to my life that makes me want to not live in that particular area
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.600]   anymore?
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.600]   >> Absolutely.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.880]   Versus, I mean, I don't know how many companies VTSAX, which you've mentioned owns, but it's
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880]   several thousand companies.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   >> It's about 3,300.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:46.880]   >> Okay.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.880]   So there we go.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.880]   3,300 companies.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:56.880]   So you would look at -- some people would look at that and say, I would much rather
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.040]   own a tiny little piece of 3,300 different companies, which all own plenty of real estate
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.520]   themselves versus one little house.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.480]   But other people say that would be so risky to own that, those 3,300 companies, because
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.440]   what if that goes up or down?
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.560]   It's a matter of understanding what's actually there.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.480]   And you mentioned -- it was mentioned in your post, and I didn't kind of point it out at
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:27.400]   that time, but one misconception that I'd like to mention and see if you agree, people
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:33.120]   have this idea that houses always go up in value significantly.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.920]   And if you look at the numbers on that, even corrected, you can look at these numbers and
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:45.120]   you can correct it for the massive increases in the '90s and the 2000s.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.440]   But if you look at it on average -- and before we -- I have the numbers.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.200]   I've got the numbers here that you link to in your post so people can follow through
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.480]   to this.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.320]   But if you think about it, what a house is, is it's a place to live, ultimately.
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.520]   So it has a certain amount of utility.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.840]   So the value of that place to live is going to be driven by what the underlying wages
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.840]   are.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:12.040]   So it doesn't matter if I can only afford $1,000 a month just because you want a million
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.140]   dollars for your house, I can't help -- I can't help you.
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:20.200]   But if I'm making a million dollars a year and you want $100,000 for your house, I'm
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:26.200]   probably comfortable offering you $110,000 if I know there's another buyer.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:32.100]   That's why you have places with such high real estate values as compared to other places.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:36.520]   If you look and chart the real estate values versus the wage values, you'll find some correlation.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:42.320]   So California real estate would on average be higher priced than Mississippi real estate.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.360]   And the per capita income of California versus Mississippi -- I haven't checked these numbers,
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.600]   but I feel pretty comfortable saying there's a correlation with California having a higher
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.240]   per capita income.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.120]   So ultimately the true price of real estate in general is going to be driven by the inflation
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.100]   rate and the inflation of wages.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:06.760]   So you link to the article and it says that by Michael Bluejay on his website -- so I
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:15.100]   just use his data -- the price of new homes increased by 5.4% annually from 1963 to 2008
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.760]   on average.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.240]   Obviously that's new homes, but that's what we've got.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:27.760]   So first he points out that the average new home size grew from 983 square feet to 2,349
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.680]   square feet over that 50 year period, or about 1.6% per year on average.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:42.520]   So he takes out 1.6% from 5.4, factors that in, and that's a 4.2% annual growth rate.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:46.700]   When you compare that to inflation, it's 4.4%.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:52.900]   So to me, inflation under his numbers were higher than the growth rate of homes.
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:58.420]   Not to say that you can't make a lot of money in real estate, but it doesn't come from mass
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.900]   appreciation.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:04.860]   It comes from buying at a deal, or it comes from forced appreciation.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.300]   And those are the key levers that if you're going to buy real estate would be valuable
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:10.300]   to look at.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.600]   Number one, is there a way that you can get a deal significantly below the market price,
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.100]   maybe a distressed sale, maybe a foreclosure, maybe somebody that just needs to move, or
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:21.660]   is there a way that you can force appreciation into the property and make the property much
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:22.660]   more valuable?
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.000]   You buy a cheap run down one and fix it up.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.300]   But it's not because necessarily real estate goes up in value.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:34.280]   It's because of the individual -- it goes up in value so much that it's basically the
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:38.680]   inflation rate that it tracks, but it's the individual property.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.880]   I went on for a little bit, but comments, thoughts, do you agree, disagree?
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.880]   No, I absolutely agree.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:49.960]   In fact, as you were talking, it triggers my memory that before 2008, before the housing
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:57.920]   market collapsed, there were people expressing concern about the rise in housing prices,
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.680]   because housing prices were rising pretty dramatically for a while there.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:09.040]   And one of the concerns that these analysts would talk about was the correlation that
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:15.560]   you just referred to between the cost of a house and the average income of the people
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.000]   who lived in the area that potentially had to buy the house.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.640]   And they were noticing that the value of the price of the house was far outstripping the
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.640]   growth in wages.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.920]   And of course, there were several reasons that that continued, at least for a while.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:36.400]   One of the big ones was that lenders were getting more and more generous with their
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.120]   lending terms.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:43.680]   So you needed less and less income to qualify and more and more -- or less and less money
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.760]   to put down.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.720]   So you can suddenly borrow 95 or even 100 percent of the property.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:58.240]   So that allowed housing prices to increase even more beyond where the wages would have
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.240]   indicated.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.720]   But that can't go on forever.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.840]   And that's also one of the factors that caused it to crash, because eventually there's just
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.400]   nobody who can afford them.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.120]   And ultimately, the price of a house is going to be tied to the wages of the people who
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.560]   live in the area that would consider buying that house.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.720]   There was another point I wanted to make, and it slipped my mind.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.200]   Maybe it'll come back to you.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.680]   Yeah, maybe as we talk it'll come back.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:29.440]   I've got a couple of things here, just kind of as we wrap up.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.560]   Believe it or not, we're at, what, an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.520]   Yeah, an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.760]   I don't mean to do these two-hour podcasts, but it seems that I get interested in a conversation
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.800]   and we get back and forth.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.200]   And I've enjoyed it, so I hope the audience has as well.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.080]   Well, you can tell it's hard to get me to talk.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.000]   Me too, right?
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.240]   So I had just a couple of thoughts, and I want to read -- and then maybe these will
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.280]   spark some thoughts, and then I'll let you have the last word.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   But just some suggestions for folks.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.840]   Number one, I'm going to repeat how you said to do the analysis.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   Four things.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.700]   Number one, calculate your opportunity cost.
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.080]   What could you be earning on the money if you were going to invest it?
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.320]   Number two, calculate your utility costs.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320]   Compare those.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:21.160]   Number three, calculate your maintenance, repairs, and insurance, especially with emphasis
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.400]   on maintenance and repairs.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.760]   If you have real data, use that, so your numbers are from real data.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.600]   But many people won't have that.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.200]   Estimate and probably estimate higher than you think.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.120]   And then number four, take into account your taxes and use those four things to figure
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:39.320]   out what the actual cost is between renting and owning.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:43.200]   Now, the key thing is, however, the individual situation.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.400]   So number one is opportunity cost.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.560]   If somebody weren't willing to say, "You know what?
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560]   I've got this.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.560]   I'm going to use your numbers.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.560]   $330,000.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.200]   I'm going to put it into the Vanguard REIT fund, but instead I'm going to buy a boat,"
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.400]   well, now you've got a totally different calculation.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.800]   Or if they said, "You know, I'm just scared to put money into a REIT fund," or, "I'm
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.160]   scared to put money into an index fund that doesn't fit what I'm trying to do, so I
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.160]   need to put it in the bank and now I'm going to earn .01%," different calculations.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.680]   So that's a huge, huge calculation.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.700]   Number two is your utility costs.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:22.080]   So in your calculation in the post, heating was included in the rental but was excluded
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.160]   in the house that you owned.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:28.240]   If you could do something to a house where you completely changed your heating costs
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.280]   or your utility costs, maybe you could build in something like passive solar design to
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.240]   stay warm in the winter or to lower your cost or, I don't know, wood stove or whatever
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.720]   the version is up there in New Hampshire.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   I live in Florida.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:42.160]   We don't worry about cold.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.160]   That would affect it.
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.100]   Number three, maintenance, repairs, and insurance.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:48.600]   This would be where you would have to calculate one individual property.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.920]   Is this property going to need maintenance and have higher amounts or is this thing a
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   gem?
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.200]   What's the insurance cost going to be?
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:01.040]   In Florida, we have hurricanes and I-95 runs right through my town.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:04.880]   East of I-95, insurance rates are significantly higher because it's closer to the coast than
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:05.880]   west of I-95.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.600]   A big deal.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.520]   Taxes, got to look at that and you can affect that based upon where you're going to own.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.800]   So example is I live close between the Palm Beach County and Martin County line here in
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.000]   South Florida.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.520]   So in Palm Beach County, property taxes are 2% per year.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.660]   In Martin County, they're 1% per year.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:27.880]   So maybe by buying smart, somebody could make some differences there.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.840]   Then look at the buying decision.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.760]   You got to look at what am I comparing.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.220]   It could be that if you're comparing a traditional stick-built house to the rent that you come
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:37.840]   out better ahead renting.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.760]   But if you compare that with maybe some sort of new technology, some sort of alternative
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.040]   building, maybe very efficient building technology, maybe there could be a different way to do
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.040]   it.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:52.580]   So think creatively, run the cost for each one and think creatively.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:57.700]   But I've loved this analysis that you've done, Jim, and I think it's been really good.
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:59.100]   What thoughts do you have to wrap us up?
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:01.580]   - Well, first of all, thank you for that.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:05.340]   And I would agree with what you just said.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:09.960]   You made the comment that a lot of people probably don't know what their actual repairs
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.780]   and maintenance costs are.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.780]   That's probably true.
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:19.040]   And if I could make the suggestion, I think that's something that people might want to
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040]   start tracking.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:25.160]   I think a lot of people struggle with this idea that maybe their house isn't a great
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.080]   investment because they really don't know what it costs them.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.640]   And it's not that hard.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.080]   I mean, you can do it on a computer spreadsheet.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.480]   You can do it on a pad of paper.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.280]   Again, as I said earlier in this conversation, I believe in keeping things simple.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:47.200]   And just jot down for a year what you spend on your house so you understand what it's
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.260]   costing you.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:51.240]   And I think that's an eye-opening exercise for people.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:56.240]   I think too often, because there's so much in our culture, because so much money is made
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.780]   when people buy houses, the government likes you to buy houses, the real estate industry
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:07.280]   likes it, the home building industry likes it, the repair industry likes it, the utility.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:15.560]   There's a lot of forces putting forth the idea that houses are a great thing to own.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.560]   And sometimes they are, sometimes they're not.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.200]   You need to understand your own numbers.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.740]   And that starts with keeping track of them.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.000]   The second thing that you mentioned was you might be, instead of buying that fund, you
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.080]   might go out and buy a boat or you might put it in the bank.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.560]   One of the reasons I suggest a proxy is it does matter what you're going to do with the
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.680]   money.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.680]   So when you're running the numbers, and again, remember when I say run the numbers, I'm not
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:45.280]   saying run the numbers and find out a house is a bad idea.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.400]   I'm saying run the numbers so you know.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   And if you run the numbers and you use a different proxy than I do, it might very well, if I
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.960]   used a different proxy on my numbers, like buying a boat or putting it in a savings account,
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.600]   it would be a very, very different result.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.240]   And maybe a result that would say, you know what, if I'm really going to do that, I'm
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.960]   better off staying in this house.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:15.720]   If I were the kind of person who was going to go out and blow the money out of Ferrari,
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.400]   high living, and it would be gone in a few years, then I'm better off staying in the
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.400]   house.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.400]   So it does matter.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:28.920]   That's why I said at the beginning, it's not, I don't care what the academic research shows,
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:36.240]   so much as I care what my real choice, choices in my life that I'm looking at matter.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:42.120]   I don't care so much whether I'm better off renting or owning the specific house I own.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:46.440]   I care, am I better owning this house or am I better renting the apartment that I want
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:47.440]   to rent?
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.960]   Because I care about the real world and my real life, and that's what I would suggest
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:56.840]   that my formula that I put in this post does for people in a way that a lot of calculators
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.840]   don't.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.720]   And I think that's the way people ought to think about it, is how does this really work
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720]   for me?
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.120]   How does it really work in my life?
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.360]   Because that's really what matters.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:18.160]   I think those are awesome, awesome, that's such a great place to leave the show.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:24.000]   And you're ringing my bell as far as what I hope this show can provide for people.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.760]   It's just simply ideas, but at the end of the day, you've got to look at your specific
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.040]   situation and you've got to be your own financial advisor and say, "Here's what is specifically
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:38.000]   appropriate to my situation."
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   So that's awesome.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.160]   >> Right, and if you can look at my situation and adapt it to your needs, then the post
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.360]   I wrote has some value.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.120]   >> And one tiny tip, just because you said to track it.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:54.320]   This is something that I hope these tips are, this may only help one person, but if it does,
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.560]   I hope so.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:03.560]   When you're tracking that, it would be a good idea to record the cost, record the money
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:08.040]   that you spend on your house, that is repairs to the house, and money that you spend on
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:11.080]   your house that's an improvement to the house.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.840]   Now I don't, obviously I can't go into what is a repair and what is an improvement.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.920]   Just think though, is this a repair or is this an improvement?
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:23.280]   Repair is just a straight up expense, but an improvement, if you'll track that separately,
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:26.600]   an improvement will add to your cost basis in a home.
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:33.440]   So let's say that you buy a $250,000 house and then I'm going to use wide numbers to
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.200]   show why this is important.
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:39.960]   If you buy a $250,000 house, you may spend $50,000 during your period of ownership on
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:45.680]   repairs, but if you spend $50,000 significantly improving the property, maybe adding an addition,
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:50.440]   something like that, your tax basis increases to $300,000.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:55.060]   Maybe you spent $50,000 adding an addition and you can turn around and you can sell that
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:53:01.640]   house for, running the math as I go, $550,000.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:08.240]   Well if you didn't track that $50,000, you would have had $300,000 of gain.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.360]   Well you're going to have to pay tax on some of that gain.
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.360]   There is a rule with your personal residence, if you live in the house for two out of five
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:20.200]   years, previous five years, you can exclude up to $250,000 in profit from the sale of
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:26.280]   a home if it's for an individual or for married couples filing jointly, $500,000 of gain.
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:30.940]   So most people usually just simply always fall under those numbers.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:35.060]   But there may be, it's possible that due to something, you may have significantly more
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:40.080]   gain than that and that increased tax basis, knowing it, may help you to avoid paying tax
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   on the gain.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.660]   So a little complicated there at the end, but hopefully that's a little tip.
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:47.860]   Just always mark on your list, is this a repair or is this an improvement, and keep separate
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:53.320]   records so that when it comes time to sell the house, you actually know what the actual
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.600]   accurate tax basis is in the property.
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:56.600]   That's a great point.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:02.460]   It always pays to know what something is costing you and to take a little effort to track it.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.860]   You're absolutely right in everything you just said about how it potentially can affect
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:09.480]   your tax bill when you finally sell.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.880]   Jim, it's been fun and I've enjoyed this.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:17.640]   I think we've given people some valuable info and it's been fun.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.000]   So I just encourage people to go over.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.360]   I'll link to all these blogs that Jim mentioned, these posts that he mentioned in the show.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.200]   I'll link to them in the show notes.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:28.800]   Click over, keep writing, Jim.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:32.640]   I know this is kind of a part-time hobby for you, but I really enjoy some of your writing.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:39.000]   I think you give good information and it's accessible yet accurate.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.920]   So I'd encourage people to sign up, subscribe to your posts, and keep up the good work.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.920]   Well, you're very kind.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.920]   I appreciate it.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.640]   I had a lot of fun doing this with you.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.160]   You're going to send all these people to my blog now just as I'm about to shut it down
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:53.240]   and go to Ecuador for six weeks.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240]   You're retired.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.240]   You're allowed.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.840]   But they can read what's already up there.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.840]   Absolutely.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:03.680]   With that, folks, this has been another episode of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:05.880]   I'd love to hear some feedback from you.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.800]   Shoot me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, or comment on the blog.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.400]   Hoping to adjust this show as we go on into being something that's a valuable resource
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:17.400]   for you.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.080]   I'd love to hear how it could become that.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.040]   So give me some feedback on that way.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:22.640]   Thanks very much.
