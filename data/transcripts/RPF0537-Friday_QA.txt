[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.480]   It's Friday and today, live Q&A.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.240]   insight, education, and encouragement that you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.480]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   I am your host.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400]   I am your fellow journeyman.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280]   I am with you on this path towards financial freedom.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.360]   And these Friday shows are where we get together and discuss the details of how to actually
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   do it practically today.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.840]   Each Friday that I can arrange the technology in order for me to host this call, we get
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.000]   together for a live Q&A call.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   I really enjoy doing these.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.400]   They are my favorite show of the week because I get to interact with you on real circumstances,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.280]   on real questions, on real things that you're facing.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.680]   This is your opportunity to drive the content of the show.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.480]   So if that means that you'd like to ask me advice on something in your own personal life,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.500]   something in your own finances, you can pump me for a little bit of low-cost financial
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   planning I guess.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.240]   If you want to ask me some tactical, technical question on anything related to financial
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.040]   planning or if you want to talk about some bigger picture thing or some philosophical
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.560]   question, if you want to agree with me, disagree with me, that is up to you.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.700]   I just go to a phone line and open them up to you.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.440]   So I'd love for you to join me for a Friday Q&A show if you would like.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.960]   I don't publish the phone number publicly to every listener.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.560]   Rather, what I do is I restrict these calls to patrons of the show, people who go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.040]   and sign up to support Radical Personal Finance there.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.560]   And I would love for you to do that if you would like to do that.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's your best way to get some interaction with me, the best way to have your questions
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   answered.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.160]   And over the years, I guess I've been doing these now, over the years people have asked
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.640]   all kinds of interesting things.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.720]   So there are currently 274 individuals just like you who support Radical Personal Finance
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.000]   at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.320]   I would love for you to join that program and in doing so to be on the next call.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.520]   Let's go first to Matthew.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.240]   Matthew, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.960]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.240]   Absolutely, Joshua.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.600]   Thank you for taking my call today.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   So on the Facebook group, I think a few months back you mentioned that you had finally made
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.280]   the change from the PC world to the Mac world with the acquisition of a new Mac computer.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   And I have been interested in making that change as well, but I've lived in the PC world
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.040]   my whole life and I feel very rooted in it.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   But I would like to think about making that change.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.720]   But from a productivity standpoint, what have you noticed from that change, pros and cons
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.640]   for making it?
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.340]   Good question and a fun one.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.200]   So I'll share just a short bit of my background and why I made the change and then answer
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680]   the question straightforwardly.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.460]   For my entire computing lifetime, I have been a PC user and a Mac admirer.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.440]   But because the cost of entry for the Apple platform is so high, I never could find the
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.940]   ability to really justify it.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.800]   So I admired some of the usefulness of the Apple ecosystem for many years, but I just
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.640]   couldn't justify the money.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.760]   And I always struggled with that because I want to make a good purchase decision.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   I really want to be frugal with my money and I want to do a good job and it just seemed
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   so hard to justify, especially because I was not in media production for most of my career.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.400]   I wasn't producing video or doing artwork where I really needed some kind of tool in
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.440]   the multimedia environment where the Apple approach really shined.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.560]   So when we're talking a decade of being an admirer and never pulling the trigger on it,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.440]   what finally forced me to move was there were three things involved.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   The first thing was that my laptop was just simply really slowing down and it came to
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.980]   the point where I finally concluded that it was hampering my ability to actually produce
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.980]   more work.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.040]   I find it very easy to tell other people that they should invest money in quality tools
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.440]   in order to produce more work.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.560]   It's easy for me to tell other people to spend their money.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.400]   I find it easy to make that intellectual argument very strongly towards others, but I find it
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.180]   a little bit harder when I have to actually open my wallet and put down some hundred dollar
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.360]   bills on the counter.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.480]   I find it a little bit harder to follow through and spend hundreds and thousands of dollars
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.060]   on good tools for my business.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.040]   But I finally reached the point where I could see that it was slowing me down and I needed
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.260]   to upgrade the computer.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.020]   The second factor that had been influential for me was Windows 10 and the complete loss
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.320]   of privacy that Windows 10 afforded.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.640]   I previously had not had a lot of problems with Windows because it was relatively easy
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.480]   to lock down some of the privacy arrangements, but after they came out with Windows 10, after
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.920]   Cortana was fully integrated, after all of the data started being sent to Microsoft and
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.760]   basically every other publisher, I came to the point where I just said, "This is absurd.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.140]   This is obscene and I don't want to do it any longer."
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.280]   So I stayed with Windows 7 for quite a while, but I eventually came to the point where I
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.600]   said, "I can't, in good conscience, I can't participate in this insecure environment.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.640]   It's wrong for all of my data to be sent back to Microsoft."
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.320]   I just didn't want to participate.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.060]   And then the third thing was in the media business, I made a decision that I was going
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.260]   to produce more types of media, especially more video work.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.480]   And I finally said, "Okay, well if I'm going to do that," because basically everybody in
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.040]   the common advice-giving landscape in the world of media, audio creation, video creation,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.440]   et cetera, because basically everybody uses Apple, it's very easy for me to get good advice
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.880]   in using Apple.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   And I would frequently find a Windows program that would work so-so, but because all of
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.120]   the other podcast producers, all the video creators, because everyone else uses Apple,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.920]   they just automatically go and say, "Look, here's the Apple solution."
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   A simple example would be a program like ScreenFlow.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.680]   ScreenFlow is, to my knowledge, a Mac-only application, but it's the program that everybody
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.080]   uses to create great and easy screen recordings on their systems.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.000]   And so I would have to go and find some Windows version of that to make things work.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.260]   And so I came to the point and said, "Well, if I'm going to do more video, do video editing
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.600]   on my computer, it's worth it for me to go ahead and just go ahead and move to Apple."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then the same thing applies in the world of privacy.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.480]   If you care about your data security, then it is a lot easier to be more secure in an
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.080]   Apple environment than in a Windows environment.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.040]   And there are kind of multiple levels to that.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.280]   Let's talk about data security for a moment.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.100]   Windows being the big player, there are many more threats that are targeted towards Windows
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.800]   users than towards Apple users.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.760]   That ratio used to be much stronger because Apple was such a small market share.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.120]   So it used to be that most Apple users came to the point where they just said, "Well,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.920]   I don't have to really worry about viruses.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.840]   I don't have to worry about attacks to my computer because it's not a PC."
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.880]   And PC users were the ones who had to protect against all those.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.760]   That seems to have changed, but it still seems that there are fewer threats for the Apple
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.000]   platform than there are for the Windows platform.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.400]   But especially if you want to move into the world of being a little bit more secure than
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.820]   the standard user.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:16.440]   For example, for a long time, the Mac operating system has allowed you to encrypt your computer
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.960]   with a built-in encryption software.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.120]   Now you can do that today.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.800]   It's called FileVault on the Mac system.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.880]   You can do that today on Windows.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.720]   I think the application is BitLocker that works on Windows.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   But it was a little bit easier to do in the Mac environment.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.440]   And there are all kinds of little interesting applications that you can use in the Mac environment
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.240]   that could work in the Windows environment.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.180]   But most of the people who are interested in greater privacy and security for their
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.360]   computer seem to gravitate towards the Mac.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.960]   And with that being an increasing concern of mine, I decided to go ahead and pull the
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   trigger.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:09:00.260]   So what I did to try to minimize the problems as far as the transition was to try to get
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.840]   something that was good enough, that was good at what I needed to do, but to get a deal
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   on it.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.320]   So what I wound up doing is I was able to buy a scratch and dent laptop that had been
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.020]   returned to a retail store.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.020]   So it was the latest.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.680]   It was a good MacBook Pro.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.440]   But I was able to get a scratched model.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.840]   Somebody had bought it, had returned it, had some scratches on the bottom of it.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   And I saved a significant discount from getting that.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.520]   As far as the transition, the transition I have found to be very easy.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.720]   It required the purchase of a few new applications, which was fine.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   I was intending to buy those applications anyway.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:45.200]   And it's required learning a few of the peculiarities with the Apple system.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.960]   But it's been relatively simple.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.320]   There's not a big learning curve.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   For somebody who is a native or almost native computer user, it's not like you can't figure
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   it out.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   It's relatively straightforward to set up.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.000]   So I've had no problem with the productivity in terms of learning how to do it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.640]   It has measurably and massively increased my own personal productivity by just having
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.920]   a faster machine.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.560]   It takes so much less time for me to process audio files and do some of the work that I
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.400]   do on a daily basis than it did in the Windows environment.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.280]   However, that's not due to moving over into the Mac OS.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.000]   That's due to upgrading the computer.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.040]   So I could have gotten those exact same things from just simply upgrading into a Windows
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.160]   machine.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.640]   There wasn't that much of a difference in terms of it's not the Mac OS that made me
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   more productive.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.800]   It was the upgrade in processor speed, etc.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   So I'm very happy with it.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:51.560]   Those privacy and kind of just OS security features are valuable enough to me that I'm
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   happy with it.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.680]   However, I do think that I'm going to move on to at some point in the coming years, I
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.760]   think I'm going to move on from the Apple ecosystem and go ahead and upgrade my own
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.800]   skills and move into the Linux system in the future.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:16.280]   What I find deeply frustrating is how everybody wants my data.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.780]   It used to be, in my understanding, it used to be that the Windows platform was a little
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.780]   bit stronger.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.200]   Sorry, was the worst and Apple was much superior.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.720]   But now I can't open up my computer without again and again Apple wanting more of my stuff,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.440]   wanting me to integrate my phone in my computer, wanting me to connect and send back all this
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.120]   stuff to the home office.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.520]   I can't download an application from the App Store.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.560]   I can't install something from the App Store without being totally verified through the
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   whole system.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.200]   I think that's just unacceptable with the increasing risk of hacking, with the increasing
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.040]   risk to data security, with the constant and never-ending breaches that we're all engaged
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.000]   in just again and again.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.400]   I'm coming to the point where I'm fed up with it.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   What I've realized is I'm not going to complain about it.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:14.840]   I just need to upgrade my own technical skills and move into the future.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:21.080]   I guess I left the 80% and moved into the 20% with the move to Mac.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.520]   Now I guess I'm going to move into the 1.1% of the computing population at some point
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.160]   moving on to Linux.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.120]   That's the direction that I'm going.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.640]   I've been happy with it.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.040]   It's been really good, but I'm probably not going to stick around too long with some of
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.600]   the changes even that Apple is making from the perspective of privacy and security.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Awesome.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.960]   Thank you, Joshua, for taking that.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.400]   You made a point earlier in your talk that talking about investing in productivity tools,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.560]   I wish that I just recently made the change from being a standard W2 employee to being
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   a business owner.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.160]   That's one thing that I wish I would have known as an employee because I think most
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.800]   of the times whatever company we work for, we just get whatever productivity tools they
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   have.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   There are so many tools out there that come in at very low cost that help increase your
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:20.160]   productivity so much that I even think as looking, even if you look into it from a personal
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.000]   employee standpoint and you can't "ride it off" or whatever, I still think it's worth
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.400]   your time to even look into that.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.160]   That's something I wish that I would have paid more attention to, but thank you so much,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.680]   Joshua, for answering that.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.720]   I've been quite curious in making that transition because you hit a great point too halfway
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.240]   through the talk or another great point that it is difficult when you actually go to look
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.040]   for tutorials and the moment that you say that it's in a Mac environment, you have to
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.400]   "Okay, I can't pay attention to this.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.360]   I've got to go find something else."
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.400]   From a creative standpoint, it does seem like most of the tutorials are in the Mac world,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.920]   but thank you so much for answering my question.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.080]   It seems as though the thing that finally got me is anytime you switch platforms, you
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   say, "Well, what am I going to lose?
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.760]   Am I going to lose the ability to run an application that matters?"
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.760]   Some people will lose that.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:23.800]   For example, there are Windows applications that are required in order for you to function.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:32.760]   If that's the case, if you are in a situation where you have to use that platform, then
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.160]   you better stick with the Windows.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.920]   But basically, I came to—and the same thing with Apple.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.400]   There are programs that only work in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.760]   But the advantage that's been around for at least the last decade—I'm no Mac expert—is
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:57.560]   that if you run a Mac, you can run Windows within that and you can run Windows applications.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.640]   To my knowledge, that's not possible in the other direction or at least it wasn't in years
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.280]   past.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:11.320]   You can usually do that and you can move over into Mac and still retain some of your Windows
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   options.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   I haven't needed to actually do that.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.320]   I thought I was going to go ahead and set up Windows, but there hasn't been a single
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.960]   application that I haven't found a superior option for in the Mac environment.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.460]   Back to tools, I know that it does make a big difference and it's hard to swallow it,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.460]   but if you actually look at it, in the early years of a career especially, investing in
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.960]   tools is perhaps the best investment that an individual can make.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:45.800]   Because if you buy a $500 tool that allows you to produce an extra $100 per week of output,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.080]   your return on investment of that over the course of a year is huge.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.840]   It's absolutely massive.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:59.720]   So if you think about it in terms of—I like to use the example of somebody who is a tradesperson
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.440]   where their acquisition of tools is fundamental to their work.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:13.240]   Somebody is a mechanic on vehicles or they're a carpenter or they're a specialized type
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.320]   of construction person.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.480]   In this situation, the tools are required in order for you to do your job and they're
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.680]   one of the best investments in the early years because they speed things up.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.480]   Now it's harder for me to look at my computer and see in it the value that a specialized
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:36.880]   set of wrenches can make for an automobile mechanic or a really great set of saws and
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.840]   specialized tools would be for a construction worker, but it is exactly the same thing.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:51.800]   And it's one of those things that should be done early because it leads to big impacts
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.240]   in the short term that will create more productivity down the road.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.800]   And the earlier you invest in those, the more you can enjoy them and the longer that it'll
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   work.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   So I recommend it and keep in touch.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.480]   Ask me that in a couple of years and we'll see if I actually make the transition to Linux.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.640]   Matthew, you got another question?
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   We'll come back to that at the end of the show.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.120]   Zach, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   ZACHARY LITMAN: Thanks.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.160]   So I have a blog about CLEP and studying for CLEP exams and I haven't done much to work
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.600]   on it, but I'm getting a lot of emails from people, new subscribers, comments, and all
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   sorts of questions.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.000]   So I'm not doing that much, so I'm kind of wondering, like, people seem hungry for this,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.960]   so what should I be doing to take advantage of this?
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   DAVE SMITH: Zach, I mentioned you on last week's show.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   Did you hear that?
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   ZACHARY LITMAN: Yeah, I heard that.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   I did.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   That was so cool.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   DAVE SMITH: Yeah.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.560]   So just for a little bit of background for new listeners, Zach has been a longtime listener
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.920]   to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.440]   I think I've recorded two episodes based upon your email questions and you wrote in to me
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.040]   about the question of saying, "I'm a 13-year-old young man.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.480]   What tips for success would you have?"
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:11.400]   And I talked about how I would use that foundation and encourage you to build towards financial
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.920]   independence by about the age of 30.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:20.440]   And a primary component of that that I recommended to you was to focus on your education, on
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.520]   building education, and on doing it in an intelligent way.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:35.240]   And so as a component of that, you decided to work and to build towards trying to achieve
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.100]   your bachelor's degree by the age of 18, primarily through distance learning.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.640]   And this is doable for you because you are educated at home.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.120]   And so you've been writing about that.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.440]   And what's your website about that, Zach?
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   What's the URL, please?
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   ZACHARY LITOWSKI: bachelorsby18.wordpress.com.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   DAVE SMITH: Great.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440]   So bachelorsby18.wordpress.com.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:19:01.840]   And there, you're talking about you're chronicling your journey and you're laying out the approach
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.320]   that you're taking towards that goal.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.680]   So the goal is to finish an accredited bachelor's degree by the age of 18 with a total amount
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.720]   of money spent on it of about $10,000.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.240]   So that's the background for new readers.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.480]   So you're starting to get a little bit of traction.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.320]   You're writing about this publicly.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   And the question is, how do you grow it?
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   Is that right?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   ZACHARY LITOWSKI: Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   DAVE SMITH: Right.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:32.440]   So the king in the world of the internet, the key thing to always focus on is service
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.480]   and just simply providing something that is useful and helpful for people.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.360]   There are all kinds of-- I don't like the word tricks.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.160]   Let me use the word tactics and techniques that can be applied to decent content to make
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   it better.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.000]   You will become familiar with terms like search engine optimization and different approaches
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.240]   to that.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.840]   Here's my analysis of those circumstances.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   It is possible to use techniques such as modern search engine optimization techniques to market
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.160]   a mediocre site and to draw a lot of people to it.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.120]   And there are some approaches where that really makes a difference.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.600]   But at the end of the day, it's more satisfying and easier just to produce something that's
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.000]   good.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And if you'll produce something that is good and that is useful and that serves people,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   in time, the internet works.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.040]   People will find it, and they'll refer people to it.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.280]   And that's basically-- that gives you a good strength where you know that if it's good,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.840]   it'll stand through as search engines change, as the way people use the internet changes.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.200]   It will go on over time.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.560]   It'll actually work.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.400]   So I've come to the conviction that if I could only focus on one thing or the other, I'm
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.700]   going to focus on trying to produce something that's fundamentally valuable.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.680]   And if I produce something that's fundamentally valuable, each person that finds it valuable
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.840]   will share that.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.960]   That's the approach I've taken with radical personal finance.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:11.720]   I've just said, I'm going to focus on doing the very best that I can and let my audience
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.200]   help me by publicizing it.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   And that has worked.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.640]   Now, I don't think it should be done all of one or the other.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.160]   And that's one mistake, because I've erred too much in my own work.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.640]   I've erred too much on just trying to produce something that's good and not enough on publicizing
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.840]   it.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.480]   But the best course is just to focus on providing something that's good.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.440]   And so when you want to do that, you've got to focus on who am I trying to serve and what
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.560]   is my purpose.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.620]   And the best way that I know to do that is to teach, is to focus on teaching.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:51.000]   And so if you are, you're currently 14 years old and you're working on this goal of bachelor's
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.800]   degree by 18, what I would recommend is the easiest and the best thing to do is focus
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.360]   on teaching somebody who's just a little bit behind you.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.640]   So pretend that you're speaking to your 10-year-old brother and you're trying to say, "Okay, with
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.300]   my 10-year-old brother, what would I encourage them to be doing?"
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.580]   And that way, you don't have to worry about trying to reach somebody who's old.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.560]   So for example, you at 14 years old, if you set out and say, "My goal is to write to a
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.860]   65-year-old grandfather and to try to teach that 65-year-old grandfather what they should
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.580]   do with their grandson," that's going to be hard for you to do.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.680]   But if you'll just focus on teaching somebody who's just a little bit behind you, a 10-year-old,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.320]   a 12-year-old, and share with them what you're learning and give your advice to them, what
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.420]   happens is the 10 and 12-year-old will find you, the 35-year-old parent of the 10 and
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.280]   12-year-old will find you, and the 65-year-old grandparent will find you.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.940]   So all three of those will find you and they'll appreciate the simplicity.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.340]   So the first thing that I would focus on is, one, serving somebody.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.660]   And the easiest way to do that is just to imagine somebody, a sibling, a friend who's
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.100]   two years behind you, three years behind you, something like that, and to teach them what
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.220]   you're learning.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.660]   And not to put on airs about it, but just to teach them what you're learning.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.820]   And so when you write an article, let's say that you are working on CLEP exams.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.300]   A CLEP exam is an exam that you can sign up to take, which will allow you to basically
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.620]   quiz out of a semester of school.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.700]   Well, there are, how many CLEP exams are there available, Zach?
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.700]   33, I think.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.660]   Okay, so there are 33 CLEP exams.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.420]   So if you think about a concept like, okay, there are 33 CLEP exams, and if you're trying
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:33.620]   to give advice to somebody who is two years behind you, then you would write an article
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.140]   and you would say, "Here are the 33 CLEP exams," and you would explain what they are.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.660]   And then you would analyze those 33 exams and you would say, "How many of these 33 exams
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.740]   should be taken or could be taken?"
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.840]   And you would perhaps rank them in order of easiest to hardest, and you would explain
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.460]   how to intelligently proceed through them.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.300]   You would investigate any scheduling and say, "If you're going to take these at 14 years
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.180]   old, if you're going to start at 14, you would need to take these exams in your 14th year,
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.980]   in your 15th year, in your 16th year, you take these," and you lay those things out.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.940]   And so basically what you do is you answer your questions, but you phrase them in terms
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.780]   of advice to somebody else.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.320]   And I've found that to be one of the most effective ways for you to learn is by teaching.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.340]   If you study educational philosophy, one of the things that I feel like we've really lost
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.840]   is the value of the so-called one-room schoolhouse.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.780]   If you were to go back 200 years and look at how students studied, they studied in the
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.420]   one-room schoolhouse, and again, that's kind of proverbial one-room schoolhouse.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.260]   It was literal in some contexts, but it wasn't literal in others.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.880]   And the idea was that you had, instead of having age-segregated learning where the 10-year-olds
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.980]   are put with the 10-year-olds and the 12-year-olds are put with the 12-year-olds, you had age-integrated
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:53.160]   learning where you had older children and younger children working together.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.480]   This is the way it was in my family's schoolhouse when I was growing up.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.220]   I was the youngest of seven children, and we were educated at home, which meant, and
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:09.620]   my mom was a trained teacher in the normal teacher education systems, and so she ran
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.880]   her homeschool in a very structured way.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   She would have her desk.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.840]   We all had our own desks, but it meant that I could hear what was happening with the older
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.360]   students and they could hear what was happening with me.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.340]   If I'm studying phonics to learn how to read, one of my older siblings would have also been
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.480]   studying biology at a high school level.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.640]   And the best way to do this in the way that it was done previously is once somebody passed
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.520]   through, let's say, the third grade, they would also, as part of their work, they would
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.080]   help somebody who was in second grade or first grade do their reading.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.920]   And I think this is really valuable as an educational philosophy because it helps to
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.000]   cement the knowledge and the learning.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.120]   I forget the numbers off the top of my head, but there are statistics that educational
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.240]   researchers and philosophers have used that identify the amount of learning, amount of
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.480]   things you retain if you read, the amount that you retain if you speak, or sorry, if
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.800]   you listen, and the amount that you retain if you teach.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.880]   And the highest way to retain is by teaching.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.800]   And so in any context, anything that you want to learn, one of the best ways to do this
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.240]   is to teach it.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.620]   I've used the advice of in studying for something that if you want to study for something, go
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.280]   and teach it to others, or if you don't have that opportunity, teach it to the wall.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   So if you're going to take an exam for, let's say, you're going to sit for the CLEP exam
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   in chemistry.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.960]   Well, let's say that chemistry is a difficult subject for you.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.880]   One of the best ways that you can handle that and learn it is to say, "I'm going to study
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.040]   this chapter of my CLEP preparation textbook.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.000]   I'm going to learn this about chemistry, and then I'm just going to, in the privacy of
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.280]   my bedroom, I'm going to stand up and I'm going to deliver a short lecture on what this
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   chapter speaks about."
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.200]   And if you can close the book and just with a few written notes, lecture that chapter
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:08.640]   to the wall, you will cement that learning in your brain in a much deeper way, and you
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   can be confident that you've mastered the material.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.580]   So when you go and sit for the actual exam, you'll find it very easy to do.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.860]   So philosophically, this is one of the most important things of ways to learn is by teaching.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.260]   You can do it individually like that, lecturing to the wall in your bedroom.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.240]   You can do it in writing.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.780]   You can do this in really any subject.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.020]   But what's happened in...
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.860]   The reason I'm going on about this is because we've lost this in much of modern US-American
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860]   systems.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:41.900]   What we do is instead of expecting others to teach, we expect each person just to sit
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.380]   and learn from an expert.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:49.300]   So instead of everybody interacting with their fellow learners, we constantly look to experts.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.600]   And this is a problem in education.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.100]   It results in one teacher lecturing to 20 to 100 students, but those 20 to 100 students
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.940]   don't really grasp the material, most of them, because they're not involved really in teaching
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.060]   it to others.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.460]   It results in challenges in business where everyone's always looking to the expert.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.480]   It results in a collapse in churches.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.040]   If you look at the way that many modern US-American churches function, it's one person standing
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.700]   and lecturing to hundreds of people, and those hundreds of people are passive participants...
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.020]   Or sorry, passive onlookers instead of being active participants because they're not involved
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.260]   in teaching others.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.140]   And this leads to a very weak, structured society.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.940]   So let me bring it back to your specific question.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.940]   Focus on teaching the things that you're trying to learn.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.060]   And that's essentially what a good writing assignment is.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.740]   And what I would recommend to you is that you view your blog as an outlet for your writing,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.980]   as an outlet for you to say, "What question do I have?"
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.540]   One of the most valuable ways that you can train yourself throughout your lifetime is
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.060]   to make a habit of journaling.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.460]   And many people look at journaling in a flawed way.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:04.380]   I used to try to sit down and say, "Dear diary, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.380]   Here's what happened today."
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.540]   And I've never in my life been able to keep that kind of journal.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.900]   It has never been interesting to me.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.500]   And I've had a dozen times where I would say, "I'm going to journal every day," and I just
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.220]   didn't have anything interesting to say.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   Same.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.220]   Right.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.740]   And it's not to say that that's not important.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.820]   In my own family, one of my sisters died when she was 14 years old.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.340]   And one of the things that we always appreciated is that she was a faithful and committed personal
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.580]   journaler.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:37.100]   So when she died, we had a stack of her notebooks for, I don't know how many years, but many
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   years, up to the time when she was 14.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.940]   And it was a great joy to be able to read those journals and get to know who she was
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.740]   based upon her dear diary entries.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.540]   And so when I was growing up, knowing the value of those journals to my family, I tried
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.540]   to do that.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   I just never did it.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.580]   Here's what I've learned, is that I can journal well if I tackle a problem.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.820]   And so I learned to just say, "Write at the top of a page what the problem is that I'm
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.900]   working on.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.960]   And then write below that what my solutions are."
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.260]   And that's basically one of the functions that a blog can be.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.740]   And that's what my podcast is.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.380]   Frequently I'll choose a topic and I'll say, "Here's my topic.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.380]   Here's my premise."
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:24.380]   And then I'll prepare the show notes in advance that are essentially me talking through the
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:29.440]   problem and trying to prove or disprove my premise or my thesis.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.780]   And so if you approach your blog in that way, you'll produce valuable, helpful content.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.540]   It'll be most helpful to you if nobody reads, but it will have the side benefit of helping
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.740]   others.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.580]   And I think if you do that consistently and effectively, that'll cement the foundation
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.300]   for your platform to grow.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.500]   And then after you have that habit, then you can come back and say, "Well, what else can
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.060]   I do to share that with others?"
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.740]   The short answer is you just interact and make friends with others online and you say,
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.900]   "Here's what I'm doing."
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:09.260]   And then if you read a question that somebody has, instead of responding to it there on
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:15.420]   their website or writing them an email, you write it with your own public answer to that
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   question.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.180]   And what I encourage you, Zach, is don't be scared of the question.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.180]   So for example, if you are trying to...
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:28.580]   If you're focused on earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18, you should think
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.500]   about the problems with that plan and you should write about them.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.680]   So you should say, "Well, what's the downside if I am able to successfully accomplish my
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.540]   goal of earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18 through distance learning for a
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.580]   total of $10,000?"
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:51.060]   Then you should then say, "What am I giving up by doing this?"
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.220]   And you should write about that.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.140]   And that's a good, valuable public blog post that you can share with others.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.780]   And what you'll learn is that as you share these ideas in public, and what I would encourage
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:07.580]   you, Zach, at 14, is I would encourage you to be very cautious, to keep your public sharing
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:14.020]   of ideas focused on a specific topic, such as bachelor's by 18, rather than things that
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.180]   are very personal.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.620]   Because the internet can be a wonderful place, but it can also be a very dangerous place.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.580]   But if you write about the problems of gaining a degree by distance study at 18 and what
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:32.900]   you're giving up by not going to the local government college from 18 to 22, then you'll
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.420]   start to get comments and feedback from your listeners and they'll ask good questions.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.700]   And then you can take that, develop it into the next question, develop it into the next
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.220]   point of contact.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   And the person who will win from that approach is you.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.900]   Your listeners will benefit, but the one who wins the most will be you.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.700]   Wow, thanks.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.900]   Any follow-up questions or is that enough for today?
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:01.460]   I think that's it, but it's really cool because as I've been writing on there, I get emails
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.620]   from people who are like, "Thanks, this is so helpful.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.100]   I see your blog everywhere."
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.540]   Or someone on the forum was like, "I'd like to thank Zach for helping me pass this exam."
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.860]   So it's just cool to be already seeing people passing exams from the blog.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.100]   My operating mindset is very simple.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.140]   I believe that these words are absolutely true.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.900]   Jesus said this, "The greatest among you will be the servant of all."
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:34.220]   And if you just simply focus on serving, as Jesus taught, being a servant to all, if you
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.540]   focus on serving, everything works out.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.700]   And a good writer, I think, focuses on serving their audience.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.300]   It's hard to hit that 100% because you don't know whether what you're saying does serve
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.140]   the audience or not.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.860]   And I have found that to be very challenging in my work.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.180]   You don't know in advance if what you're doing is serving.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.820]   But if you just have that servant's heart and you maintain that attitude of saying,
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.780]   "How can I be of service?"
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.940]   If you do that, that will be helpful to other people.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:10.300]   And as one of my favorite quotes by Zig Ziglar, as he rephrased what Jesus said in this way,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.220]   he said, "You can have everything in life you want if you just help enough other people
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.740]   get what they want."
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.540]   That's just a rephrasing of what Jesus taught, that the greatest among you must be the servant
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.180]   of all.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.700]   If you keep that philosophy, what you'll see is it's really true.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:32.220]   At every stage, the person who serves the most people is the one who gains the most
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.220]   benefits.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.660]   And you can see this work out on the macro scale.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:44.140]   Even in capitalism, you can see it work out in basically every area of our society.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:49.740]   A company that serves the most customers effectively is a company that, in a free market system,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.060]   absent government coercion, that's a company that will, over the long term, be built on
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   a strong foundation.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:01.740]   So just focus on serving, and what you'll find, I think, is that everything becomes
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.260]   simpler and you always have a foundation to go back to.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.780]   Andy in Indiana, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.660]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.660]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.540]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.460]   I really appreciate this opportunity to call in and get some advice.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.540]   I have a young friend of mine who is in an excellent financial position, and I've kind
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.940]   of wanted to get your input on if there was anything special you'd recommend that he be
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.500]   doing at this stage.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:36.100]   So he's 18, graduated from high school, has a job with a local company where they will
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:42.700]   pay for his college education, basically whatever he wants to do that's related to the work
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:48.300]   that they do, which he wants to get an engineering degree, which is related, up to $7,000 a year
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.700]   as long as he's an employee.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.820]   And then he also is working full-time with them, making about $40,000 a year, and is
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.900]   able to live with his parents.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:03.180]   So I guess kind of the Mr. Money Mustache thing would be just throw it all in a 401(k)
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.860]   and a Vanguard account, and I wondered if you had any more suggestions for somebody
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.260]   that has that kind of income and low expenses.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.500]   What a phenomenal situation to be in.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   How did he find...
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.680]   Do you know anything about the background?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.940]   How he found this job?
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.660]   What he did to come to his boss's approval?
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:25.900]   Were they willing to approve this tremendous situation he's in?
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.980]   I actually work for the same company.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.740]   I'm actually finishing the same apprenticeship program he's in.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.980]   I'm just quite a bit older.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.940]   The company across the board will pay for any of their employees to get education.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.220]   That's just a standard employee benefit.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:49.540]   And then the program he's in is an apprenticeship where he's apprenticing as a drafter.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:55.920]   So he does CAD drawing for this engineering company.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.180]   And then four years of on-the-job training, certain educational requirements that they
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:07.060]   have, which are part of a Bachelor's of Engineering degree, and then you work full-time in that
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.060]   apprenticeship.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.060]   That is wonderful.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:22.300]   If I could just wave my hands and rearrange the US-American culture without forcing people
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.660]   into a certain path, but rather encourage just a complete transformation of the normal
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.100]   process, what you're describing is, in my mind, ideal.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.220]   It's what I hope that my children would be able to find and develop in the future.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.980]   I see so many benefits in what you're describing.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:47.340]   Let me just quickly enumerate those before answering your advice, just from the philosophical
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   perspective.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:54.180]   Well, there are a few major problems that I see that face young men and women in this
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:00.100]   delicate transitional age, 18, 16, 19, 20.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:06.940]   It's an age at which there are a lot of questions, and it's an age at which either major mistakes
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.300]   can be made or major benefits can be had.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:21.700]   If you look at them and analyze them, they fall into a few key areas.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.660]   And so let's talk them through.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:30.660]   One would be educational, in terms of what's the education that people are getting.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.100]   Our current society has big questions about it.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.820]   It's really messed up in the way that we approach education, because education usually lacks
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.260]   context and meaning.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:50.800]   If a young man or woman is not trained in, is not active in a specific area, they usually
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.140]   just go based upon, "Well, what sounds fun to me?
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.100]   What job would sound interesting?
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.980]   What career sounds fun?"
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:04.040]   And you see kind of an increasing aimlessness amongst young men and young women, especially
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.900]   as it relates to college.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:11.300]   Frequently, people will be undeclared in their major, "I'm just kind of exploring things."
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:17.060]   But exploring things in a college class can be either helpful or non-helpful.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.860]   For your college career to be based upon exploration can be unhelpful.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.740]   But if you have a career that's established and defined in purpose, then taking a little
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.960]   bit of exploration with things that interest you and enjoying the benefit of learning at
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.980]   that age can be really helpful.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:37.300]   But educationally, there's a lot more value in study if it's connected to a career, if
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.100]   it's connected to a purpose.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.980]   And so for somebody who is currently working and is apprenticed in an engineering firm,
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:50.600]   they're a junior drafter and they're learning on the job, that gives them the ability in
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:56.700]   their formal studies to apply what they're studying and actually have context and reason
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.900]   for it.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.260]   And in the way that our culture is structured, where many firms don't want to work with people
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:10.140]   who are students while they're in school, really the traditional area of this was agriculture,
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.540]   where a farmer would send his son off to agriculture school.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.060]   Well, at least he could come home and say, "Dad, here's what I'm learning," and they
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.460]   could start to apply the different techniques.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.780]   But that should be in most businesses.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:25.460]   So I love the apprentice model from an educational perspective because it allows there to be
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:30.700]   meaning and context with learning as related to the job.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:36.060]   So the job gains because the firm is getting the benefit of the current academic knowledge
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.580]   and the student gains because they see meaning and application in what they're learning.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.740]   One of my biggest regrets about my personal degree, my final, my cumulative bachelor's
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.300]   degree was in international business.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.980]   I never found any relevance in studying business.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.020]   It was always intellectual knowledge that didn't have any context.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.780]   But when I got my master's degree in financial planning, I used that information every day.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:07.260]   And for me, the educational balance of my bachelor's degree and my master's degree were
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.500]   night and day in terms of their impact on me.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.100]   The second, of course, is financial.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.660]   And what you described, I really love because instead of being an unproductive leech where
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.780]   the only benefit that a young man has here in this context is to spend money, spend money,
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.380]   spend money, then there's actually an earning component as well.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:35.460]   So they can retain that self-worth of actually earning and being productive while also learning.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:41.240]   And because they're earning, it gives a balance to their ability to interact normally financially
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.400]   with the world.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.880]   If you take somebody totally out of the workforce and they have no income, it leads to challenges
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.500]   of how do you actually structure your life?
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.780]   How much money can you afford?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.620]   How much money can you not afford?
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.260]   When I was in college, one of the great mistakes I made, my first year I worked my way through,
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.220]   but most of my work was spent paying for tuition.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.560]   My second year, I stopped working and I started borrowing.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.380]   But what happened was because I was borrowing, I kind of felt like, "Well, it's no big deal.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.980]   When I graduate from college, I'm going to have this great high-paying job, so I might
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.020]   as well just spend as much money now as it takes for me to enjoy my life."
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:21.220]   And so I spent, I dramatically overspent because I was spending free money, money that I got
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.780]   on student loans.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.980]   And so if you can avoid that and you have somebody that's earning, then they're able
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:31.300]   to still put constraints on their budget and have the benefit, of course, of all of the
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.740]   financial benefits, which we'll get to, of their situation.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.260]   And then the third thing is just the moral aspect of a young man's life.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.940]   It's very, very bad and destructive for young men and women to have 168 hours a week available
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:50.660]   to them, of which only perhaps 12 to 18 hours are committed in class.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:59.140]   That leads to so much free time and it's fundamentally destructive to most or many students' lives,
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.860]   where it leads to idleness, it leads to bad choices, it leads to just a very, very bad
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.100]   indulgence of hedonism frequently, which leads to moral rot.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.860]   And so one of the most important things, I think, for young men and women is to maintain
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.180]   themselves very busy.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:22.420]   And I find for myself that if I put in structure for myself, a busy structure, it helps me
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.900]   to stay out of the ditch, it helps me to keep on the straight and narrow.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.740]   If I remove those time constraints, if I remove that busy structure to my life, then it's
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   very easy for me to wind up in a ditch.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:39.420]   So I love everything that you've said without my actually answering your question yet.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.100]   I love what you're describing, Andy.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.020]   I did think, Joshua, while you were speaking, one comment that you asked about how he was
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.020]   able to get into that position.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:54.100]   And I think it may be helpful to put this to mention, like the job that he has is not
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.820]   a blue-collar job, or I mean, sorry, it's not a white-collar job.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.780]   It's not a guy who's doing an engineering job.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.780]   He's in a union apprenticeship that if he does everything right and works really hard
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:09.820]   in 15 years, he'll top out making $70,000, $75,000 a year.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:15.540]   And almost everybody in that program, because I'm actually in the same union program at
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:22.380]   the moment myself, is from a blue-collar background, has no aspirations to get a college degree,
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.700]   has no aspirations to move up within the company.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:31.820]   They just are intending to top out in that union job, which is a very good job, don't
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:37.140]   get me wrong, but where he's looking to maybe get an engineering degree and move on, he
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.140]   will have to leave the union.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:44.940]   So to get somebody from a white-collar background looking for a good job in this company, I
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:50.900]   very much doubt any of them would actually look at the program that he's in.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.680]   Usually you need somebody younger to take advantage of that, but there are so many opportunities
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.500]   right now for people to get great jobs, earning good amounts of money if they're willing to
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.980]   work and if they're willing to get their hands dirty in the nature of their business.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:12.460]   And so as far as career advice, what I would say is basically the perfect approach for
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:19.080]   somebody like him is one, do good work and keep your job and learn on the job and study
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:27.060]   whatever's necessary on the job so that you actually can just excel at the requirements
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   of your work.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:33.540]   Two, get the engineering degree, because an engineering degree is a hard science degree,
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.380]   which is very valuable in the marketplace.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:40.860]   It's valuable because it imparts practical tools and it separates and sets apart the
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:48.300]   student from somebody who's pursuing some random degree in sociology or communications
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.780]   theory or something that doesn't have very much practical application.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:46:02.980]   Engineering has a basic corpus of academic knowledge that can be applied in various specialties,
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:10.560]   and so that sets him apart in terms of his basic, the value of that education.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:17.100]   Number three is I would do self-study in business, and the best recommendation I would have for
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:24.580]   him would be pick up Josh Kaufman's book, The Personal MBA, and read that book as just
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:36.740]   a pithy, hardcore summary of basic business concepts, and then in personal reading, work
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:41.460]   through his suggested book list of the Personal MBA book list.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.180]   And if I were him, I would probably, after finishing the MBA degree, I would go ahead
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:53.580]   and take advantage of my educational velocity and just finish some distance learning MBA.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.220]   There are a number of MBA programs that can be done entirely through distance learning
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:06.420]   without interfering with the day-to-day career, and they're inexpensive to get, but an engineer
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:12.760]   with an MBA is a very marketable individual in the job marketplace.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.740]   That would be kind of my suggestion for him.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.980]   Any comment on that before I go on to financial planning?
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.300]   No, that sounds like a great plan.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.980]   So here would be my comments on financial planning.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.700]   We're in the world of, is there anything wrong with this plan, for example?
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:36.820]   Is there anything wrong with this young man putting the majority of his investments into
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.180]   the Vanguard Total Money Index Fund, as my friend Jim Collins would recommend?
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.560]   No, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.920]   Is there anything wrong with this young man buying a house and living in it or renting
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   it out?
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   No, there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:58.540]   So the first thing we would need to do is identify what are his interests and what's
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.860]   his natural bent?
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.400]   What is he naturally drawn to?
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.460]   That would be important, because in terms of identifying what's the right move for his
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.780]   money, he can't do that without knowledge of who he is.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:18.140]   If he's a handy guy, he's working in a blue collar trade, and he's a handy guy and he
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:26.620]   has a good amount of money, he could be a great fit for buying a semi-dilapidated duplex,
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:32.860]   triplex, quadruplex, moving into one bedroom of a quadplex, renting out the other three
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.060]   units and one or two of the bedrooms in his own personal unit.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.040]   That could be a tremendous use of his money.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.340]   He could put himself in a situation where a couple years from now he strokes a check
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:50.380]   for $150,000 of cash and buys that, and it would be a tremendous use of his money.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.580]   But if he has no interest in real estate, has no desire to learn about how to do it,
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.660]   then that's probably not a good move.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.140]   If he's entirely interested in his corporate career, it's not bad for him to put all his
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:06.340]   money in a total stock market index fund and just to focus on his corporate career.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.900]   That's a really simple, easy process.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.620]   On the other hand, if he has interest in entrepreneurship, he may be able to use his engineering degree
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:18.260]   to get in with maybe somebody else that he meets and they want to start a new company.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:24.740]   In that case, he finds some outlet for the money in his personal life.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.700]   You can't really give good financial advice without the context of the individual nature
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.560]   of the investor or the individual nature of the person.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.380]   Some people are well-suited to stock market investing.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.060]   They have nerves of steel.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.740]   They're knowledgeable about it.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.660]   They're not going to sell when the market dips.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:48.100]   They're not going to get greedy when Bitcoin is shooting off and the S&P 500 is stagnant.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.660]   They're good fits for the stock market.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:57.120]   Some people are good fits for some unique trading strategies within the market.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   They enjoy it.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.120]   They study it.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   They want to spend their time doing it.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.940]   Some people are not good temperamental fits for that, and they're really best at buying
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.260]   local houses and fixing them up.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.940]   You have to know about the investor individually.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.880]   Let me give you the things I do think are important.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.380]   Number one, I think the first thing for a young man to focus on is, to the best degree
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.340]   that he knows, to choose location.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:25.540]   In the current situation, he's able to live with his parents and he has a great job and
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.620]   a great college.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.900]   He probably shouldn't make any changes.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.980]   That's the perfect scenario in my opinion.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:36.100]   But if he does want to live in a different location for some reason, it's best to make
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   those transitions as early in life as possible because locational stability is very valuable,
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.460]   but it has to be started at an early age.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.180]   But the earlier it starts, the better.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:51.740]   A 50-year-old who's been in a local community for 30 years and who runs a local business
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:57.580]   and who's been active in the local community will have a much stronger base to their life
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.380]   than a 50-year-old who just moved into the town two years prior.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:07.740]   If there's any uncertainty about location, then the person should choose that as clearly
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.780]   as they know.
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   With regard to money, the first focus with money should be to save and to establish for
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.500]   that location, to save and to figure out what needs to be done to be in that location.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.900]   The second thing is career choice.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.660]   What career choice is available to them?
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:33.540]   If somebody is not well-established in a particular career, then they should focus on exploring
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.540]   that career.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.380]   Now, it sounds like he's got a good start, but there may be more things to do with money
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.420]   related to that career in the days to come.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:47.020]   And so if he needs to pay for his own MBA or if he needs to pay for something outside
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:53.300]   of what's provided for this job, he should be available and aware of it and have money
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.860]   saved for that goal and for that benefit.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.220]   The third thing is personal relationships.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:05.620]   So one of the best focuses of his time should be into establishing his personal relationships
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:13.140]   and making sure that he makes few decisions without having those big things squared away.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:19.300]   I've come to the conviction through personal experience and through study that to encourage
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:27.060]   somebody to invest in any kind of outside investment until they have the basic structure
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:32.860]   of their life established is probably unwise.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.460]   And I don't know any way to prove any hard numbers, but I'll tell you the two that I've
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.260]   shared on the show that I think are really important.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.700]   The numbers are $10,000 and $100,000.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.580]   The first goal, I don't think any investment should be made until a young man or woman
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.500]   has $10,000 cash in the bank and is debt free.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   If you have $10,000 cash in the bank and you're debt free, there is almost no life decision
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.860]   that you couldn't make.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.660]   You can move across the country, you can change jobs, you can change careers.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.140]   You'll be scrambling a little bit.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.980]   $10,000 might only cover your income for a few months, but you can do that if you're
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.220]   $10,000 and debt free.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.860]   So that should be his first goal.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.440]   The better goal, I think, is $100,000 and debt free.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.500]   If you have $100,000 of cash in the bank and you're debt free, there's no limit on your
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.200]   ability to marry.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:28.780]   There's no limit on your ability to buy property, to start businesses, to change location, anything.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:35.780]   And in terms of the strength, the emotional strength that somebody has by having $100,000
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:41.740]   in the bank being debt free, I don't think you can match that with the fact of somebody
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:47.540]   being having the money in a mutual fund or having the money in real estate or really
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.540]   anything.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.100]   So those would be my first pieces of advice to him.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:55.860]   Clarify where he wants to live, the career that he wants to be involved in, and what
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.820]   the prospects are for his marriage relationships.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:03.580]   Set a clear goal of building the first $10,000 in the bank and then $100,000 in the bank
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.700]   and debt free.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:10.740]   And then once those goals are met, to apply that diligence to figuring out what the path
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.020]   to financial independence is going to be.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.220]   And here I'd recommend episode 460 of the show, which I did, which was called How to
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:22.780]   Decide What to Invest In, which walks somebody through that thinking process to say, "Okay,
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:26.680]   I've got this base, this foundation.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.840]   Now where do I go?"
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:36.260]   In the early years, I made the mistake of following basic financial planning books,
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:41.940]   which said, "Put all your money in a Roth IRA, put all your money into mutual funds."
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:47.900]   And I didn't enjoy the stability of life that I would have if somebody had just told me,
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.020]   "First $10,000, then $100,000 in the bank."
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:57.560]   And now in my early 30s with a young family, I wish I had followed a different path.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.900]   Because although I made a little bit of money on stocks and although I made a little bit
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:10.880]   of money on various other investments, the emotional and life security gained by having
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:17.740]   money in the bank and being debt free, those are things that I would not trade for a slightly
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.900]   higher rate of return in stocks at this stage of life.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:29.300]   I'm against basically all of financial advice in that, but it has been a source of great
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.060]   satisfaction and peace to me to go against it.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.900]   And all I can do is speak from experience and from a little bit of analysis.
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.900]   Those would be my thoughts, Andy.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:46.420]   So this is a rough map in my head with what he's able to save of $1,500 or $2,000 a month.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:54.380]   Would you recommend he basically puts that all in a savings account in the bank for the
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.380]   next four or five years until he's got $100,000?
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.740]   Am I understanding that correctly?
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   Basically yes.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.780]   And here's where I think it is valuable to say, is this a hard and fast rule?
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.300]   No, I don't think so.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:14.060]   So what could I imagine in terms of, let's say, fast forward a year.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.220]   Because if he doesn't have, absolutely it should be $10,000 in the bank.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:24.620]   Every young man or woman should maintain $10,000 in cash in an emergency fund as quickly as
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.900]   they can.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.100]   But there could come a point where, let's say, two years from now he realizes that this
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:36.660]   company, although it's a great deal and he's enjoying it now, two years from now he realizes
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.300]   this company and this industry is not for him.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:44.780]   Well, he should cut bait and move on to the next thing that might be for him.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.460]   He should go explore that as quickly as possible.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:51.420]   And just because they'll pay him an extra $7,000 for tuition doesn't mean he should
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.060]   stay there if he realizes that the career is not for him.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.060]   Time's a wasting.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.940]   He may need to go and try something else and something different.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:04.100]   So I wouldn't stick with the career and stick with the college plan just so I could
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.260]   get to the financial goal.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.220]   I would say, let me fix that because that's prior to the financial goal.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:14.540]   So another example would be, let's say that he takes an interest in something like real
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.540]   estate investing.
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.300]   Well, I wouldn't encourage him to go out and buy a house if he doesn't have $10,000
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.300]   in the bank.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.980]   But let's say, fast forward two years and he's got $35,000 in the bank.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.900]   And he and his dad are looking around.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.020]   They find a property and he's studied.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.860]   He's been reading his books, et cetera.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.620]   And he's figured out, listen, here's what I can do.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.180]   Dad will lend me $20,000.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.220]   I've got $20,000 here.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.180]   We'll make a $40,000 down payment and the owner will hold the financing.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180]   This would be a great place.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:46.180]   I'll move in there and I'll put a bunch of buddies from college in the other units.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.060]   Then I wouldn't say that he has to wait to make that decision until he has $100,000 in
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.060]   the bank.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.340]   But I would caution him to do it too fast.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:57.940]   And that's where I don't know how to put more – I don't know how to make a hard line.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.740]   I don't think a hard line should be drawn.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.620]   It's a matter of what's the current goal.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.980]   Same thing with like let's say that he meets a girl and he wants to get married.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.980]   He should get married.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:10.900]   He shouldn't wait on saving until I have $100,000 in the bank.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.260]   If he decides, hey, this is a girl I want to marry, he should marry.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.700]   And so maybe he takes money from his savings to buy a ring, pay for a wedding, have a nice
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.300]   honeymoon, whatever they decide is important.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.740]   That's more important than reaching the $100,000 goal.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:30.460]   But conceptually I'd want to move towards that foundation as quickly as possible over
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.460]   time.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:40.100]   But not put significant assets into Roth or 401(k) or other mutual funds until you've
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.100]   got that.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.760]   So I wouldn't focus heavily on it.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.300]   And here's where you get into a little bit of nuance, which is hard.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:55.380]   If his company has a 401(k) and if he gets a match on the money, then I think that would
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.340]   be worth participating in up to the match.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.420]   That's fine.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:04.860]   That's usually a small amount of money and that's relatively meaningless.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.540]   Using a Roth IRA, should he put money in a Roth IRA?
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.540]   I think so.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.120]   I don't see any reason not to.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.960]   If he puts $5,000 into a Roth IRA, there's no problem.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.500]   There are no penalties for him to withdraw his original contributions at any time.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.340]   And so I would encourage him to use a Roth IRA.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:29.200]   But I would be slow to invest all the money into stocks until I really had built up savings.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.180]   And so there's nothing wrong with those things.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.160]   I'm trying to lay out what I see as the big picture goal.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.860]   And then those just simple tactics come in.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.860]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.860]   Use a Roth IRA.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.140]   Use a 401(k) if you have it.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.140]   I don't have any problem with that.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.580]   What I have a problem with, let me clarify.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:48.360]   What I have a problem with is focusing first and foremost on the Roth IRA as a way of leading
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:53.220]   to wealth rather than focusing on life stability because that's what I did and I regret.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.340]   When I was 18 years old, I had read a book.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.580]   I read various books and they said, "Put money in a Roth IRA."
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.620]   And so on my 18th birthday, I sat down.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620]   I filled out the paperwork.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:06.020]   Of course, I could have done before 18, but for me, that 18th birthday was just a day
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.020]   that I did.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.900]   So I filled out a paperwork for a Roth IRA.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.060]   I opened a local mutual fund and I started putting, I think, a couple hundred dollars
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:17.380]   a month into the mutual fund with a mutual fund company in the Roth IRA.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.700]   The problem was I didn't have a purpose for that beyond retirement and retirement didn't
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.180]   matter to me.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.420]   What I came to realize was that by viewing that as retirement, yeah, it was fine that
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.680]   I saved up some money and I have some money in a Roth IRA.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:35.780]   And yes, I could go and take the money out and use it for my own personal expenses.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:42.500]   But what I missed by focusing only on age 65 retirement, I missed having the money available
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:49.860]   for myself to make intelligent career choices, to make intelligent choices with my marriage
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.260]   and having a clear financial goals early on in my marriage.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:01:01.820]   I missed having the foundation to pursue some personal things that I could have pursued.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:09.960]   Now I look back and I realize a few different occasions where I was feeling pinched financially,
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.340]   but I wasn't going to touch the money in the Roth IRA because once I put it in, I'm going
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.420]   to leave it alone.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:20.700]   There were times at which I should have used gaps in my life to further my long-term career
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.640]   ambitions instead of just having money in a Roth IRA.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.200]   That was a very verbose way of answering the question, but that's what I want to protect
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   young people from.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.560]   I want to teach young people how to use money, but to use it not just for this ultimate goal
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.680]   of till 65.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:42.640]   I want them to apply that focus and to adjust it not from 65, but to apply it to now, which
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.960]   will lead to 65 working well.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.720]   I was very disciplined about putting money in a mutual fund for retirement because I
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.880]   knew how compound interest charts worked.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.600]   But what I found is that just because I could look at the compound interest chart and see,
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.120]   "Well, look, I'm going to be so much richer at 65 because I started at 18," I made a lot
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.440]   of mistakes from 18 to 20, till now.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.880]   I'm not immune to mistakes, but I made a lot of mistakes during that 18 to 25-year timeline
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.280]   that I now regret.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.140]   I wish I had done things differently knowing what I now know.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.140]   That's my answer.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.140]   All right.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.140]   Thanks, Seth.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.140]   Thank you.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.320]   My hope is that he's a learner.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.960]   The only way I know how to handle those things is to encourage him to be exposed to different
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:34.520]   ideas and to think carefully about what he's working towards and why, and then go from
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520]   there.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.720]   Matthew, back to you for your final question, which I didn't expect to be so appropriate
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.760]   given that previous call.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.240]   But go ahead with your second question for today's show, please.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.520]   Absolutely.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.400]   The one question that I run into all the time when I'm reading a new blog or a new book,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.800]   and I continually find myself asking, "Who has had a significant influence on the author's
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.600]   life while I'm reading?"
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.860]   Now you can typically find out after reading a little bit of their writing, but it never
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:06.520]   is really explicitly stated by the author.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.840]   Also know that most people have thousands of different influencers that have shaped
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.240]   the way that they think.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.280]   However, with the Pareto principle, there are only a few influencers that make up the
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   80%.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.920]   My question is, who would be the top five people that have had the most influence on
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   your life?
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.160]   I don't know if five is the right number, so feel free to choose three or ten or whatever
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.520]   works out better for you.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.760]   So here, it's a good question, and it lines perfectly with what I just went through on
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.320]   the previous call.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.960]   Let me lay out five, because of course we all have hundreds, and I could trace things
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.640]   that I appreciate about all kinds of people.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.080]   One thing I am good at is I'm good at reading people that I disagree with and trying to
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.240]   just learn just a little bit and gain from that.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.480]   I don't think that anyone...
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:59.400]   I don't have a monopoly on wisdom, and so I try to plunder the Egyptians and take anything
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:05.240]   I can from anywhere I can, take wisdom and insight from anywhere.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.480]   And I also think that it's hard to overstate the importance of timing.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.580]   A lot of people's influences come down to the time at which they're exposed to something
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.280]   or to somebody.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:24.840]   And so I'll restrict this to finances, but explain just a few influences.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.000]   So the first, and I'll do this chronologically in terms of my own thinking.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.720]   Some of my early influences on wealth and kind of wealth building were get-rich-quick
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.960]   gurus.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.680]   When I was younger and in high school, I wanted to get rich, and of course it's relatively
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.320]   easy to find the get-rich-quick gurus at that stage.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:54.800]   And so from the shady ones, I'm going to intentionally avoid naming names, just because I don't wish
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   to...
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.280]   Well, I'm going to avoid naming names.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.720]   But from the popular ones at my era, there were a number of gurus that laid out certain
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.240]   things that said, "I'll name...
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   It's not that all bad."
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.800]   So examples from the early days would be Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.320]   Robert Kiyosaki was extremely influential.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.800]   He came to his height of fame right at the time at which I was paying attention to finances.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.480]   And so I remember I was with a whole group of peers that were reading Rich Dad, Poor
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   Dad.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   It was passed all around everywhere.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.600]   We were all thinking about, "How do I move into the B or the I quadrant, and how do we
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.940]   get rich with these things?"
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.840]   That led me to the world of real estate gurus.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.680]   There were other people as well, the multiple streams of income, Robert Allen, kind of the
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.680]   gurus.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.480]   I moved into the real estate guru world from randomly going to a seminar and starting to
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.080]   move into that world.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.520]   And everything was about, "How do you get rich, and how do you get rich quick?"
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.680]   And that was a big, big focus of mine, is how do I get rich, and how do I get rich quick?
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:07.040]   And I'm very appreciative of some of the things that I learned from many of those people.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.800]   But today I look at it, and I realize that I didn't know what I didn't know.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.160]   I didn't know how to spot danger.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:18.440]   I didn't know how to spot charlatans who were just seeking to defraud me, and who were
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:26.240]   painting it as so easy to get rich that I didn't know.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.920]   They painted it so easy, and they focused on the lust for wealth rather than the principles
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.560]   that would lead to wealth.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.440]   I remember this so clearly.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.000]   When I was in my early years in college, I went to a real estate seminar down in Miami.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.960]   It was a three-day seminar that I had gone to, and this was a big and very fraudulent
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.760]   industry during that time period.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:54.040]   But I went to this seminar down in Miami, and the presenter of the seminar was a—it
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.800]   was for a Russ Whitney seminar.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.680]   Russ Whitney's organization was huge at the time.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.720]   It later went on to collapse.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.320]   He ran into some legal trouble.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.680]   I haven't heard—I haven't followed the cases that have come since then.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.720]   But it was a presenter in the Russ Whitney seminar world.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.560]   I remember so clearly, in hindsight now, I can analyze what was done at that seminar,
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.620]   where everything that led was about, "Look at me.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.620]   Look how rich I am."
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.360]   The presenter came in and looked sharp.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.080]   He was wearing his beautiful suit and red tie, just the power suit.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.800]   He looked sharp.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.600]   Everything that started the seminar was all about how much money he had.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:47.080]   It's printed clearly on my memory, the picture that he showed of his provost or prevo, his
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.760]   big old provost coach, these million-dollar bus motorhomes that he owned, and that he
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.440]   parked in front of the hotel.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.580]   His saying at the seminar was, he said, "My driver drives my bus down.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:05.940]   The driver stays in the hotel, and I stay in my million-dollar prevo bus because I don't
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.040]   want to stay in the hotel room.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   I'm more comfortable in my own space."
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.240]   Now I can clearly understand the psychological manipulation that was happening there, because
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.320]   the point of that seminar—it was of moderate cost—was to go on and sell the $30,000 real
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.860]   estate coaching package.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.100]   But I didn't see it at the time.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.680]   I didn't have the filters.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.140]   I was gullible and naive.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:39.180]   I was looking at this, and then they start showing the deals of, "Here's the picture.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.500]   I bought this house for $60,000, and then I flipped it and fixed it up, and I sold it
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   for $180,000."
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:50.620]   It's just this ongoing lifestyle salesmanship that really was influential on me.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:56.300]   It was only by the grace of God and the intervention of my dad, who, when I was about to sign myself
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:01.500]   up for $30,000 on my credit card, to join the real estate coaching, who forcefully put
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.860]   his foot down and said, "Joshua, that is stupid.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.860]   Don't do it."
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.980]   Thankfully, I listened to him and didn't do it.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.580]   I'm so grateful for that, because I went on and watched a number of my friends who pursued
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:17.220]   it, and two that I've had contact with that went into the real estate business.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.820]   Both of them went bankrupt.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.160]   One of them fought his way out of it, and one of them didn't.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.580]   It was a difficult time.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.500]   But there were a bunch of gurus at that time that had an influence on me.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.760]   The next person that was influential was Dave Ramsey.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.700]   In the midst of all that guruness and all the get-rich-quick, then I was given by my
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.140]   brother a copy of Dave Ramsey's book, The Total Money Makeover.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.340]   I was at the time a finance and accounting major in college.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:55.660]   I read the book, and it was a transformative influence on me, because what Ramsey said
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.780]   was, he presented a simple plan.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.980]   The statement that that book focused heavily on was peace.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.440]   His first book, or one of his earlier books, was Financial Peace.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.580]   He made the point, he said, "If you don't have any payments, how much money do you have?
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.940]   If you didn't have any payments in a month, how much money would you have every month?"
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:21.540]   At that time, I had put myself deeply into debt with credit cards and student loans,
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.220]   and that statement just really made sense to me.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:33.360]   His plan was so simple that I understood it, and it spurred me to action.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:40.420]   To this day, I don't think there's anybody better than Ramsey in his ability to give
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.540]   a simple plan that stirs people to action.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:49.620]   I say that after a decade of combating him as a ... Not a decade, excuse me, that was
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.340]   a wrong timeline.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.900]   After a decade of influence, I spent six years as a financial advisor, and I was really disgusted
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.100]   with Ramsey during that time, because I would have all kinds of technical arguments with
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.100]   him.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.780]   I would be upset at the technical financial planning statements he would make about investments
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:11.220]   and investment returns, or about insurance.
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:15.020]   I sold whole life insurance, and he hated hates whole life insurance, and different
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.660]   things like that.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:20.140]   Those technical things are relatively meaningless in the grand scheme.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:25.300]   He is brilliant at creating a simple plan.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.020]   In my earlier years as a financial advisor, I thought, "Well, the technical argument is
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.020]   the key one."
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.980]   Like in the previous call, "Well, it's all about putting money in the Roth IRA."
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.500]   No, it's not.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.340]   If you just put some structure in place, you can use a Roth or not use a Roth, but that's
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.180]   not the thing.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.020]   His baby steps were so influential in my life.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:53.060]   They led to my getting out of debt, which was really important at a certain stage.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.340]   Without his baby steps, I couldn't have become a financial advisor, because I would have
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:03.980]   been in debt and not been able to make the lean early years as a financial advisor.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.700]   His influence was really, really important.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:11.780]   To this day, Ramsey does so much good.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:18.460]   If somebody just followed the Ramsey plan, it's hard to see the error in it.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.500]   It's really hard to see it.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.060]   The technical side of me wants so much to argue with him and to talk about, "Look, I
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.660]   can make it better, and I can do this trick and that trick."
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.940]   What I've learned is it doesn't so much come down to tactic and technique.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.940]   It comes down to behavior.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.460]   He does so much good.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.540]   I've wondered at various times if I should go and work or try to go and work with him.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:41.980]   I don't have any contact.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.500]   I met him a few years ago when I was in Nashville and talked with a couple of his team, but
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.540]   I have no contact with his organization.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:52.180]   They do so much good that today, even though I might have a good friendly argument with
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:59.580]   him in terms of his approach and some of the technical things, he's brilliant.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:04.600]   I love how he helps people focus on behavior.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.940]   If people just followed his plan, there aren't a lot of errors in it.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.820]   He was very influential to my financial philosophy.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:19.620]   As a financial advisor, in interacting with people, I started to see how the solutions
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.660]   weren't technical.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.180]   They were behavioral.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.780]   For a long time, I would buy his books by the case, and I would give them to clients
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.860]   that were in debt that I couldn't afford to help.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.340]   They didn't have any money.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.140]   I couldn't help them, so I just gave them a book and said, "Here, maybe this will help
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.140]   you."
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.860]   The other influence in the financial perspective was Tom Stanley.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:43.180]   I'd been aware of Tom Stanley at an earlier age in terms of—I forget the year in which
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:51.100]   Millionaire Next Door became popular, but it was about the time that I was paying attention
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.940]   to this, maybe a little bit before me.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:58.620]   That was one of the canon of personal finance literature that was influential with me.
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.060]   What I went on to do was I didn't stop with The Millionaire Next Door, but I started to
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.340]   read his technical books.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.300]   He wrote three books prior to Millionaire Next Door, or I don't remember the timeline,
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.380]   but he wrote three books.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.700]   One was called Marketing to the Affluent.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.340]   One was called Selling to the Affluent.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.300]   One was called Networking with the Affluent.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:25.780]   Those books, as a financial advisor, were helpful to me in seeking to build my—I tried
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.300]   to use them as a platform for my business to try to understand who is the millionaire
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.900]   next door and try to work with those millionaires next door.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.500]   In doing that, I came in contact with a lot of millionaires next door.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:45.620]   I realized that what I wanted in terms of their wealth or what I wanted in terms of
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:51.660]   finance, I didn't want to be the ostentatious, flashy real estate guy.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:57.620]   I wanted to be the guy who—I think so clearly of a friend of mine.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.620]   He was a real estate investor.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.060]   I've tried and tried to get him on the show.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.260]   He refuses, but he was a real estate investor.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:10.980]   He just basically lived his life in a pair of cargo shorts and a polo shirt and a pair
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.820]   of boat shoes, has a nice yacht, has a nice normal house that he lives in, but he's
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:15.820]   insanely wealthy.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:20.740]   I know a bunch of these guys that are insanely wealthy and their life and their lifestyle
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:29.860]   of freedom based upon true frugality and outward frugality, it changed me because I recognized
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.660]   that's really, really valuable.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.700]   They don't have the baggage of public wealth.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:43.300]   Rather, they have the enjoyment of wealth without it coming with any curses.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.660]   Usually, they do it in all different businesses.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:48.900]   They do it in all different industries, but I learned that from Stanley.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:54.480]   Stanley and his profiles of people were really, really impactful.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.620]   His later work was also really good.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.740]   I wish that he were still around.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.780]   It's my regret that I never, although I had a little interaction with him, I really
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.620]   wanted to get him on the show and oh well.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.620]   Stanley was helpful to me.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.420]   Someday soon, I'll do a show.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:16.620]   The title is Lifestyles of the Frugal and Obscure because that really is, I believe,
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.620]   transformative.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:23.820]   The next person who was influential in terms of a chronological impact for me was a man
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.100]   in Gary North.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:31.060]   I stumbled across Gary North in my interest in economics when I was a financial advisor.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.100]   This was probably almost a decade ago.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.720]   I stumbled across his website and I started reading his stuff.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:46.260]   Because I was interested in his economic analysis, I became familiar with his work.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:51.540]   In reading his work, he would make allusions to things that didn't make sense to me but
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.460]   that I was attracted to.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:00.980]   Specifically, his hardcore writing on the intersection of Christian theology, economics,
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.500]   and personal finance, that that intersection to me was fascinating because I'd always had
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.980]   an interest in economics.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:13.380]   I had enjoyed economics classes in college, although I was trained from a mainstream Keynesian
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.860]   perspective, just like most college economic students are.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.540]   I'd always had an interest in personal finance, but much of the personal finance work was
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.900]   outside of Christian theology.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.460]   And then much of the personal finance work in Christian theology was so mediocre that
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.060]   it's just, I had a hard time relating to it.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:38.740]   Larry Burkett, for example, was a long-time Christian guy in the world of Christian financial
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.740]   advice.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.740]   He did a good job.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.140]   I'm not accusing him of being mediocre.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:48.940]   But it seemed like most of my interest would wind up with secular writers or writers who
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.540]   didn't explicitly appeal to Christianity.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.580]   And I always felt like there's something more here.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:56.080]   There's something deeper.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.660]   When I read the Bible, it's like there's something that I want to understand a little bit deeper.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.580]   But I couldn't find, it was hard for me to access.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:11.820]   And it seems like the trouble with reading the Bible and reading any particular verse
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:17.180]   is you can often find any verse or two that lays out what you want to believe, that appeals
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.740]   to your own confirmation bias.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:23.580]   And it's much harder to take it as a whole and say, "Well, what's happening as a whole?"
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   And so I started to learn that from North, and I started to read his economic commentaries.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:34.180]   He wrote, so his background, he started when he was in his early 20s, in his mid-late 70s
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.180]   at this point.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:39.960]   But he started writing an economic commentary on the Bible in his mid-20s, and he's worked
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.580]   on it for 50 years.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.900]   He's written something, I mean, he's written 60 books, something like that.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:55.100]   But he's written a verse-by-verse commentary on the economics of the Bible, and he wrote
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:00.900]   30,000 pages to prepare for his ultimate last few books, which he's been writing, which
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:06.340]   are basically the capstone books, summarizing and synthesizing what he learned from his
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.700]   50-year study of economics.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:15.900]   And his work was very helpful to me philosophically and financially because of various philosophical
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.340]   conflicts I had.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:25.680]   When I was in college, I had socialist professors, I had some conservative professors, but conservatism
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.180]   as a political philosophy has never made sense to me.
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:32.000]   I can't understand it having a firm foundation.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.540]   So I had a bunch of socialist professors, but I also started reading in libertarianism.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:40.140]   And I didn't know how to interact with these things.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:49.180]   And North wrote extensively on an interaction with Jim Wallace, who is a prominent Christian,
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.220]   a mainstream Protestant Christian who is very prominent in an aspect of Christian theology
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:20:00.540]   that's called--not liberation theology--anyway, very prominent in kind of a socialist Christian
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.540]   message.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:05.300]   And I always struggled to figure out, how on earth do I integrate that with what I see
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.160]   in scripture as well?
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.820]   And so North's writing through that was influential to me and helpful to me.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:18.420]   I have struggled with a lot of what he has written because he exposed me to a number
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.860]   of things that I disagreed with but couldn't argue against.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.380]   And I still struggle with that.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:31.220]   I've read his recent books on Christian economics, and it's kind of one of those things where
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:37.140]   I wanted to believe, I want to--my confirmation bias wants me to accept what he says, but
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:41.020]   I have a hard time embracing it fully for various reasons.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:44.340]   I've been intending for a long time to get him on the show and ask him some of my questions,
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.440]   and I intend to do that if he'll grant the interview.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.680]   But he was influential for me in a period of time, kind of buttressing my willingness
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:21:01.440]   to defend intellectually things that I believe personally and not to shy away from basing
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.540]   everything on a biblical worldview.
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:10.340]   It was through North's writings that I wound up being exposed to an aspect of Christian
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:17.080]   apologetics that was championed by a man named Cornelius Van Till, who defended--he's dead
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:23.680]   now, but he defended a method of Christian apologetics that is called presuppositional
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.120]   apologetics.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.760]   And that led me--I'd studied other apologetics methods as well, but it was the work of Cornelius
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:38.600]   Van Till, which was popularly championed by Greg Bonson before he died, that led me to
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:46.640]   kind of a deeper interaction with the intellectual presuppositions of political philosophy, and
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.400]   especially as it relates to finance.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.140]   So you'll often hear some of that in my discussions, and those are the influences that were helpful
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.140]   to me.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.560]   Let me move on.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.640]   Finally, the fifth probably very influential person for me was reading Jacob Lund Fisker's
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.740]   book, Early Retirement Extreme, and his website.
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:14.640]   Because what Fisker unlocked for me was the mechanics of how financial independence could
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.740]   be achieved without relying on get-rich-quick schemes.
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:28.160]   And it's hard to describe how stupid I felt--I've described it in previous shows, but I felt
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:36.340]   so stupid when here I was, a financial planner, the CFP and a master's degree in financial
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:40.460]   planning and blah blah blah, I know how to run a financial calculator, and I had never
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:49.140]   sat down and understood the chart of two financial freedom and financial independence.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:55.800]   And that was basically the final--that was one of the most influential things on me,
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.160]   where I understood the separation of income and expenses and how that related to wealth.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.760]   And his work was so influential on me.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.800]   It was also influential because I appreciated his engagement with other topics.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:17.980]   His engagement with conservationism, environmentalism and conservationist approaches, his engagement
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.640]   with a bunch of things.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.480]   And so Fisker was very influential to me and really, really helpful because he kind of
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.760]   made that final unlocking of things.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:38.140]   And so if I were to go back and I were to trace my own--the development of my own personal
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:45.360]   opinions, those would be the intellectual thought leaders or the intellectual people
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.300]   that had profound influence on me.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.640]   One was all the get-rich-quick gurus, two was Dave Ramsey, three was Tom Stanley, four
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.640]   was Gary North, and five was Jacob Lund Fisker.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:04.040]   And then that was all buttressed by my academic studies in financial planning, where I was
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.640]   exposed to new areas as well.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.600]   But those would be the five people that I would trace as having been deeply influential
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.400]   on my own financial philosophy.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   Oh, that's--yeah, that's an excellent way of actually thinking about things chronologically
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   too.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.360]   It's encouraged me to sit down and actually make a note of that as well, to think about
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.040]   it from a chronological perspective.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.640]   Because if you were thinking about just a top five right off the top of your head, you
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.040]   would not think of the earlier years, because that's obviously--it's shaped and molded who
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.720]   you are today, but it wouldn't be who you would choose if you were telling me, "Here's
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.840]   the five people to go study."
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.840]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.800]   It's an excellent way of looking at it.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   Right, right.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:55.560]   And that chronology, I could trace the various challenges and struggles that I've had in
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.240]   different areas of my own philosophy.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.920]   Let me give you an example.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.200]   When I was younger--let's start with the Get Rich Quick guys, Get Rich Quick gurus.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:15.480]   The Get Rich Quick gurus advertise hedonism as their primary advertising mechanism.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.640]   It's all about, "Look at me, look at the car I drive, look at the house I live in," et
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   cetera.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.660]   I was raised with Christian parents who were not hedonists.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:30.160]   My parents always gave a huge amount of money, gave significantly, and they met the needs
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.480]   of their family, but they never focused on consumption.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.800]   But in that normal kind of adolescent and post-adolescent reaction against that, I was
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.960]   interested in getting rich so I can have fancy things.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:49.480]   I used to make my lookbook of my $150,000 cars and my mansion on the water and all of
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   that stuff.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.560]   That was important to me.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.460]   But then there was a time where, going through college, when I was born again towards the
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.000]   end of college, that my heart totally transformed.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.160]   And then at that point in time, I was left struggling, saying, "Well, I don't have this
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.200]   desire anymore to get rich quick, but I don't know what to do."
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.280]   And so that kind of naturally led into some of those other influences.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:20.360]   And so it was in understanding that frugality, for example, that I could be very content
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:27.880]   with frugality, but recognizing that there was no reason in the world why I couldn't
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:36.040]   earn $2 million a year, live on $50,000 per year, and give away or invest intelligently
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.760]   the other remainder.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.880]   There wasn't any reason why I couldn't do that.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:47.800]   And that solved for me some major personal, intellectual, and philosophical inconsistencies,
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.440]   things I struggled with to try to figure out, "How does this reconcile?
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.160]   How does this go together?"
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:27:00.360]   And so basically, how I have found that I learn is, when I have a question, I start
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.560]   studying the question.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.360]   And then all of a sudden, I'll often find somebody who speaks to that question.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.800]   It may have been somebody that's speaking today, or it may have been somebody that spoke
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.960]   1,000 years ago.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.240]   But often, before you ask the question, you didn't need the answer.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.880]   And so it's once you ask the question that you come along and there's, "Oh, okay, I see
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.880]   this.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.760]   Here's how this can work out."
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:30.680]   And so for me, each of those people, I can identify for you now, post hoc, I can identify
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:38.960]   the specific struggle I had, the problem that I couldn't fix, that each of those men influenced
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.200]   me in, that helped me to reconcile the seeming contradiction.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:52.080]   Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time today to explain that.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.520]   And thank you for taking my call.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520]   My pleasure.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.560]   Well, thanks for calling it, and we'll look forward to your questions in the future.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:03.000]   Thank you for being a faithful caller to these Friday Q&A shows.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.760]   I always enjoy the interaction that we have here.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.080]   As I hit the music, my closing comments would be this.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:20.920]   If you are facing a question or a challenge, don't be scared of it, but lean into it.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.440]   Don't be scared of questions.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:28.760]   Now, I say that out of a philosophical conviction that truth exists.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.080]   It exists outside of the human experience.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.900]   And so that means that there should be nothing that it needs to be scared of.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:42.040]   Truth exists independently of human knowledge and independently of human existence.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.240]   That's given me that philosophical and religious presupposition has given me always the confidence
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:54.960]   to press forward and try to say, if I'm having a problem understanding an interaction with
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   something, I can fix it.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   It can be solved.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.920]   I just need to understand what the question is.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.160]   So in your own intellectual journey, I have many questions of my own still today.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.560]   And I think everyone I've talked to who's old and learned usually winds up at the end
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:13.960]   of their life, they wind up learning that they have many questions.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.600]   You don't ever resolve all your questions.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.040]   And I don't expect to ever resolve all of my questions.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.600]   What you can do is you can use the study of the questions that you have, of the contradictions.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   You can use the studies that you have to help you to look at your questions, help you to
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:38.040]   answer them, and help to advance the total knowledge of humanity and help to lay a marker
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.200]   down for others.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.880]   If you come along and if I were to trace some of the influential thinkers, whether it's
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:50.560]   religious, financial, philosophical, whatever, you can come down and you can look and you
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.680]   can trace the threads of conversation over thousands of years that have influenced who
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.560]   you and I are today.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.720]   Now some of those threads are true and valid and some of them are not.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720]   Don't be scared of them.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.520]   If you have a financial problem, lean into it and start studying.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.080]   And I think that you'll be able to trace those thinkers for yourself.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:14.080]   I wish you all a very happy Friday, a very good Friday, a very happy good Friday.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.080]   And thank you for listening.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.000]   I look forward to speaking with you on next week's Q&A call.
