[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980]   I'm going to ask you a question. What's the most common question you get asked in a call?
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.160]   We get together for a live Q&A call and I really enjoy doing these. They are my favorite show of the week.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.920]   because I get to interact with you on real circumstances, on real questions, on real things that you're facing.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.240]   This is your opportunity to drive the content of the show.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.420]   So if that means that you'd like to ask me advice on something in your own personal life, something in your own finances,
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.960]   you can pump me for a little bit of low-cost financial planning, I guess.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.800]   If you want to ask me some tactical, technical question on anything related to financial planning, I can ask you.

[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   Over the years, I guess I've been doing these now, over the years, people have asked all kinds of interesting things.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.840]   So there are currently 274 individuals just like you who support Radical Personal Finance at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   I would love for you to join that program and in doing so to be on the next call.

[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:23.860]   So thank you for taking my call today. So on the Facebook group, I think a few months back, you mentioned that you had finally made the change from the PC world to the Mac world with the acquisition of a new Mac computer.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.860]   I have been interested in making that change as well, but I've lived in the PC world my whole life and I feel very rooted in it. But I would like to think about making that change.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.900]   From a productivity standpoint, what have you noticed from that change, pros and cons from making it?
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   From a productivity standpoint, what have you noticed from that change, pros and cons from making it?
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.900]   Good question and a fun one. So I'll share just a short bit of my background and why I made the change and then answer the question straightforwardly.

I still think it's worth your time to even look into that. That's something I wish that I would have paid more attention to but thank you so much, Joshua. So I'm going to end my presentation here.

So,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:51.300]   you write an article, let's say that you are working on CLEP exams. A CLEP exam is an exam that you can sign up to take, which will allow you to basically quiz out of a semester of school. Well, there are, how many CLEP exams are there available, Zach?
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   33, I think.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:14.420]  .
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:21.400]   Okay. So, there are 33 CLEP exams. So, if you think about a concept like, okay, there are 33 CLEP exams, and if you're trying to give advice to somebody who is two years behind you, then you would write an article and you would say, "Here are the 33 CLEP exams." And you would explain what they are. And then you would analyze those 33 exams, and you would say how many of these 33 exams should be taken or could be taken. And you would perhaps rank them in order of easiest to hardest. And you would explain how to intelligently proceed through them. You would investigate any schedule. You would have to do that. You would have to do that.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:27:16.600]  . I've used the advice of studying for something that if you want to study for something, go and teach it to others. Or if you don't have that opportunity, teach it to the wall. So, if you're going to take an exam for, let's say you're going to sit for the CLEP exam in chemistry. Well, let's say that chemistry is a difficult subject for you. One of the best ways that you can handle that and learn it is to say, "I'm going to study this chapter of my CLEP preparation textbook.

[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.420]   This is one of the most important things of ways to learn is by teaching.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.820]   You can do it individually like that lecturing to the wall in your bedroom.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.820]   You can do it in writing.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.820]   You can do this in really any subject.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:05.020]   But what's happened in the reason I'm going on about this is because we've lost this in much of modern US American systems.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:12.960]   What we do is instead of expecting others to teach, we expect each person just to sit and learn from an expert.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   So instead of everybody in the room, we expect each person to sit and learn from an expert.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   So instead of everybody in the room, we expect each person just to sit and learn from an expert.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   So instead of everybody in the room, we expect each person just to sit and learn from an expert.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   So instead of everybody in the room, we expect each person just to sit and learn from an expert.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:42.240]   I'm not sure if you can see this, but we're constantly looking at experts.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.340]   So instead of everybody interacting with their fellow learners, we constantly look to experts.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:42.440]   And this is a problem in education.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:42.440]   It results in one teacher lecturing to 20 to 100 students.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:42.540]   But those 20 to 100 students don't really grasp the material most of them because they're not involved really in teaching it to others.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.540]   It results in challenges in business where everyone's always looking to the expert.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.540]   It results in the collapse in churches if you look at the way that many modern US American churches function.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.560]   and the collapse in the collapse in churches if you look at the way that many modern US American churches function.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.840]   It's one person standing and lecturing to hundreds of people.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.000]   And those hundreds of people are passive participants,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.040]   or sorry, passive onlookers instead of being active participants
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.960]   because they're not involved in teaching others.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.860]   And this leads to a very weak structured society.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.340]   So let me bring it back to your specific question.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.600]   Focus on teaching the things that you're trying to learn.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.660]   And that's essentially what a good writing assignment is.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.140]   And what I would recommend to you is that you view your blog
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.140]   as an outlet for your own personal learning.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.160]   And that's essentially what a good writing assignment is.

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   And that's essentially what a good writing assignment is.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   You write it with your own public answer to that question.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   And what I encourage you, Zach, is don't be scared of the question.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   So for example, if you are trying to, if you are, excuse me,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   If you're focused on earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   You should think about the problems with that plan.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   And you should write about them.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   So you should say, well, what's the downside if I am able to successfully accomplish my goal of earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18 through distance learning for a total of 18 years?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   So you should say, well, what's the downside if I am able to successfully accomplish my goal of earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18 through distance learning for a total of 18 years?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   So you should say, well, what's the downside if I am able to successfully accomplish my goal of earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 18 years?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:42.540]  , and you should then say, what am I giving up by doing this?
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   And you should write about that.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   And that's a good valuable public blog post that you can share with others.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   And what you'll learn is that as you share these ideas in public. And what I would encourage you, Zach, as at 14, is I would encourage you to be very cautious to keep your public sharing of ideas focused on a specific topic, such as Bachelors by 18,
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   and what I would encourage you to be very cautious to keep your public sharing of ideas focused on a specific topic such as Bachelors by 18,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   The internet can be a wonderful place, but it can also be a very dangerous place.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   If you write about the problems of gaining a degree by distance study at 18 and what you're giving up by not going to the local government college from 18 to 22,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   Then you'll start to get comments and feedback from your listeners and they'll ask good questions.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   And then you can take that, develop it into the next question, develop it into the next point of contact.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:42.580]  ,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   And then you can take that, develop it into the next question,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   and then you can take that, develop it into the next question,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   and then you can take that, develop it into the next question,

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   and then you can take that, develop it into the next question, and then you can take that as well as well as well as you can.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   I think that's a good question. And I think that's really cool that's really cool. I think that's really cool that you already seen people passing exams are like passing exams.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.580]  , but I think that's really cool that's really cool that's a lot of the best.

[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:51.540]   and I'm going to talk about what sounds fun to me, what job would sound interesting, what career sounds fun. And you see kind of an increasing aimlessness amongst young men and young women, especially as it relates to college. Frequently, people will be undeclared in their major. I'm just kind of exploring things. But exploring things in a college class can be either helpful or non-helpful. For your college career to be based upon exploration can be unhelpful. But if you have a career,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   and
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   that's established and defined in purpose, then taking a little bit of exploration with things that interest you and enjoying the benefit of learning at that age can be really helpful. But educationally, there's a lot more value in study if it's connected to a career, if it's connected to a purpose. And so for somebody who is currently working and is apprenticed in an engineering firm, they're a junior drafter, and they're learning on the job, that gives them the ability in their formal studies
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   to be able to do what they want to do. And so for somebody who is currently working and is apprenticed in an engineering firm, they're a junior drafter, and they're learning on the job, that gives them the ability in their formal studies

Money that I got on student loans. And so if you can avoid that and you have somebody that's earning, then they're able to still put constraints on their, on their budget and have the benefit of course, of all the financial benefits, which we'll get to of their situation.

[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:50.980]  , but then there was a time where going through college, when I was born again towards the end of college, that my heart totally transformed. And then at that point in time, I was left struggling saying, well, I don't have this desire anymore to get rich quick, but I don't know what to do. And so that kind of naturally led into some of those other influences. And so it was in understanding that frugality, for example, that I could be very content with frugality,
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:50.980]   And so it was in understanding that frugality, for example, that I could be very content with frugality, but I could be very content with frugality,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   I couldn't live, I couldn't earn $2 million a year, live on $50,000 per year, and give away or invest intelligently the other, you know, the remainder. There wasn't any reason why I couldn't do that. And that solved for me some major personal intellectual and philosophical inconsistencies, things I struggled with, try to figure out how does this reconcile? Where does this go? Where does this go?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   I couldn't live, I couldn't earn $2 million a year, live on $50,000 per year, and give away or invest intelligently the other, you know, the remainder.

[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:51.020]  , and there's, oh, okay, I see this.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:51.020]   Here's how this can, you know, I'm not going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details, but I'm going to go through all the details,
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   I can identify for you now, post hoc, I can identify the specific struggle I had, the problem that I couldn't fix, that each of those men influenced me in, that helped me to reconcile the seeming contradiction.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time today to explain that.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   I appreciate you taking the time today to explain that.

[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:58.080]   Now, I say that out of a philosophical conviction that truth exists.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.800]   It exists outside of the human experience.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.120]   So that means that there should be nothing that it needs to be scared of.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.200]   Truth exists independently of human knowledge and independently of human existence.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:18.940]   And that's given me, that philosophical and religious presupposition has given me always the confidence to press forward and try to say,
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.080]   If I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a,
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:21.080]   That's given me, that philosophical and religious presupposition has given me always the confidence to press forward and try to say,
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:21.080]   If I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a,
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:21.080]   That's given me, that philosophical and religious presupposition has given me always the confidence to press forward and try to say,
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   If I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a, if I'm having a,
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   It can be solved.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   It can be solved.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   It can be solved.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   I just need to understand what the question is.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   So in your own intellectual journey, I have many questions of my own still today.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   And I think everyone I've talked to who's old and learned usually winds up at the end of their life. They wind up learning that they have many questions. You don't ever resolve all your questions. And I don't expect ever resolve all of my questions. What you can do is you can use the study of the questions that you have.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   You can use the study of the questions that you have.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   You can use the study of the questions that you have. You can use the study of the questions that you have.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:30:21.120]  , of the contradictions. You can use the studies that you have to help you to look at your questions,
