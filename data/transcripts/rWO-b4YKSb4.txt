[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300]   To get started, the first thing we need to do is install the Python client, wandb.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.380]   We can do so by calling pip install wandb.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.940]   After you've created an account, you can log in locally by calling wandb.login in Python
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.020]   or calling wandb.login from a terminal.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.780]   You can then follow the link to get your API key and paste it in the box shown.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.380]   This is the same code as in our previous video, where we're using print to log our metrics
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.700]   and our config values are hardcoded.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.800]   This is that same training script, but slightly refactored to use Weights & Biases.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.420]   To tell Weights & Biases that we'd like to begin to capture details of the code we're
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.200]   running, we want to tell it to create a run.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.740]   A run is how Weights & Biases organizes the details of every time that you run your code.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.060]   To create a run, we just call wandb.init.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.900]   We've also refactored this code to gather all of our configs at the top of the script
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.100]   and then pass that to wandb.init.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.780]   We're also referencing that same config whenever we're using those values throughout our script.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.580]   Here is that same script, but refactored even further so that rather than printing our epochs
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.120]   and our loss throughout training, we're passing it to wandb.log in a dictionary.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.280]   This is where we put metrics from our run, like the model training or validation loss,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600]   and we can call this many times when running the script.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.000]   And Weights & Biases will store and visualize the history of each of the different metrics
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400]   as we log them.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.100]   Once we've done all this, we're a long way towards having reproducible experiments.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.160]   In the next video, I'll run this script and I'll show you how we can get insights from
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   the Weights & Biases workspace.
