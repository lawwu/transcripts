[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Our next question comes from LifehackerAddict928.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   LifehackerAddict asks, "How do I overcome productivity prong?"
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   He elaborates here, and I think this is useful to hear about his relationship with this.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   He says, "Do you have any thoughts and suggestions on how I could overcome productivity prong for good?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I have practiced time blocking fairly successfully for quite some time now.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I use a straightforward set of tools to do it to avoid productivity prong distractions.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I do not want to be about which tool to use, but I still struggle with a persistent,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   nagging feeling that I might be missing out big time by not using various apps or keyboard shortcuts, etc."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Alright, this is a good question because there is a subset of people who really do struggle with this.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   The core claim of productivity prong, which by the way, if you want to find out more about,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I wrote an article called "The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   It came out last summer in The New Yorker.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   My editor and I were excited to get the term "productivity prong" into the hallowed pages of The New Yorker after 100 years.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   So I don't know if that's a high point or a low point, but read that article for the whole history of this movement.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   But the core message, if I'm just going to summarize it, is that with the right tools,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   with the right configuration, with the right software, you can make work easy.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You can make producing very high impact, high value results, something that is a walk in the park.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   The tool can somehow take off of your plate the cognitive strain of producing really good output.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I call shenanigans on that notion. It's not going to do it.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Here is what you get with better tools, better configurations, better software.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You can get at max a 20% improvement in the difficulty of getting your work done.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That 20% matters. It's nice.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I like that when I use Scrivener to write an article instead of Word, I can have two panes.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And on one pane I have the notes from my research, and on the other pane is the section of the article I'm writing,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and I can therefore type verbatim from my notes into the article I'm writing.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   That makes my life 20% easier.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   But it's still really hard to write an article.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And I wrote seven books without having Scrivener.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yeah, it would have been a little bit easier, but it doesn't make the work itself easy.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's the key thing to keep in mind when you're thinking about productivity habits or tools.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   You want a good set of them because you don't want to keep track of things in your mind.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You want to be intentional about your work. That really matters.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You want to get rid of friction you don't need, but don't sell yourself on the image that the tools itself is going to make hard work not hard.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Nothing can do that for you. Hard work in the end is going to be hard.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Now productivity prong hit its peak in the first decade of the 2000s,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   but there is a particular thread of it that I think has come back in recent years.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's something I've been talking about a lot on this show,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   which is over promising about what a note-taking system called Zettelkasten can actually offer.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   There's this really interesting approach to note-taking that I've talked about on this show.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   If you look at my interview with Srini Rao from a couple months ago, we got into it,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and it's a really interesting way of taking notes where you link your notes with links like you would web pages.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You create a conceptual map of different ideas, a perfectly fine way to take notes.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm messing around with it myself.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   There is, however, an extreme view of what is possible of Zettelkasten that is brewing out there,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   where the actual art of having original creative thoughts is being offloaded, according to the scheme, to the note-taking system itself.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   There's an extreme version of this out there where people think that if you're just creating notes and making good links,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   eventually you will be able to survey those links, to surf or navigate those links,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and have really original creative connections come up, and you'll have really brilliant thoughts,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and a book or an article will just fall out of your complex web of notes.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I just don't think that's going to happen.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I've been writing books and articles my entire adult life,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and there really is no shortcut to this very human and very cognitively demanding task of thinking and sorting through all this stuff you know,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   these expert schemas you have in your mind for what articles are,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   all these hundreds or thousands of articles you've read in your life,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and slowly trying to accrete something that could actually work as a piece.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   That's never going to just fall out as a side effect of you using a software tool properly.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So I give that example just to emphasize that the productivity-prone mindset is still out there.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So life hacker addict, care about your tools, care in particular about the types of things I talk about,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   which is less about tools and more about being intentional with your time and organized with your information.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's all great, but also be ready that hard work is going to be hard, and that's not a bug, that's a feature.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   There's no miracle out there, so stop wasting time seeking that miracle.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Spend that time instead doing the hard work right in front of you.
