[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Is there a place that someone looking for some travel inspiration can take from you?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.840]   I think the second city, like as a general rule, it's going to be more affordable,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   you're going to have less foreigners, so more of a chance to meet local people who maybe aren't
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.560]   overwhelmed with how many foreigners there are. So like right now in Korea, I'm talking to you
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.320]   from Busan, which is the second city, and I can list a lot of advantages over going to Seoul
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   because of how more of an authentic experience I'm having, but still having the comforts of
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.240]   being in a city. Obviously you're going to be even more authentic if you go to a village somewhere,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.280]   but the city life I happen to enjoy, so the second city in a lot of countries, I'm a huge fan of
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.480]   basing myself there for a certain period of time to get to know the culture in a different way,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   and generally I tend to be one of the few foreigners who is in that city to be able to
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520]   have a bit more of an authentic experience.
