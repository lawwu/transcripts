I thought it was bad, but now it gets worse. My goodness. Okay. I get it. Your car broke down. Did you not think of fixing the car instead of buying a $51,000 pickup truck?

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:49.320]   and you've never thought about saving money. Did you never think about the fact that cars might break? You know what cars cost money, vehicles require repair, and your body requires food. My goodness. My four-year-old has better forethought than you do.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   and you've never thought about saving money. Did you never think about the fact that cars might break? You know what cars cost money, vehicles require repair, and your body requires food. My goodness. My four-year-old has better forethought than you do.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.160]   Thank goodness. $51,000.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.560]   Yeah, I know you were tired of trying to figure out a ride or figure out how to borrow a car, but man, you could rent a car for cheaper than this thing. Okay, hold on. Let's see here.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.960]   $51,000. So in the first year you own this thing, this stupid truck is going to lose 20% of its value in the first year.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.760]   Maybe even more, because after all, it's a pickup truck. Okay. Well, maybe, I guess there's a little bit of an argument that pickup trucks sometimes...
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Okay. Well, maybe, I guess there's a little bit of an argument that pickup trucks sometimes...
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Okay. Well, maybe, I guess there's a little bit of an argument that pickup trucks sometimes...
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Okay. Well, maybe, I guess there's a little bit of an argument that pickup trucks sometimes...
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:46.200]  , no, no, not this brand. No, not this brand. At least a Toyota pickup truck. If you bought a new one, it would have been a better buy than in the used market, but you bought a domestic pickup truck.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Come on. All right, so $50,000. Let's just keep it simple. $50,000. 20% of that truck's value means that you're going to lose $10,000 this year.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:06:14.640]   And you didn't stop and calculate the fact that you're going to lose $10,000 this year on this stupid pickup truck. That's over $800 per month, every single month. Now let's do some math. You earn $34,000 per year. Yes, I know exactly how much you earn because the idiot leaves your personal documents lying around your house. And of course, I happen to care about money. So when I see check...
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   Anyway, I should have paid for it.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   Anyway, I should have paid for it. So when I see check...
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   Anyway, I should have paid for it. So when I see check...
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:43.080]  , whatever. You really should take better care of your stuff. $34,000 per year. That's because you make $16 an hour because you spend all your time hanging out on Facebook and hanging out on YouTube, reading car magazines and having to spend enough time to open a book and learn how to get a decent job. So this month you're going to spend...let's see, what? How many hours? Okay, so $10,000, $830,000.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:07:12.480]   $833 per month divided by $16 an hour. That means that this month you're going to spend 52 hours working a job that you hate. So your fat, shiny truck can sit there in the parking lot in the hot sun all day getting its paint messed up because you bought this stupid domestic truck. They can't even put a paint job on the thing. You never looked around and looked at it. But wait, it's worth it. You pot this thing with...
