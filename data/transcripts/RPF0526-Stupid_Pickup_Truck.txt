[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   Are you kidding me?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.280]   Arrghh!
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.400]   I cannot believe you are so stupid!
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.760]   Arrgh!
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.200]   I wanna punch you right now!
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   You idiot!
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200]   You idiot!
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   You idiot!
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   You bought a stupid pickup truck!
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.160]   And a new one!
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   Brand new!
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.160]   Look at this stupid thing!
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160]   Oh, here you are at the dealership.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   Oh look I got a...
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160]   Oh my goodness.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.360]   I'm flipping through Facebook here and I see your stupid post about you standing there
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.920]   with that goofy smile on your face about "Hey guys, we bought a stupid pickup truck!"
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.720]   Well you didn't say stupid, you thought it looked nice.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.320]   "Had some problems with the other car and decided it was time for a change."
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   Pfft!
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.480]   You freaking idiot.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.480]   I cannot believe it.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.200]   And you'd be so stupid as to post it on Facebook.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   Arrgh!
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   Man!
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   Do you not have a brain?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   Do you not think?
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   Do you not...
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   Arrgh!
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280]   I wish I could tell this to your face but you're so stupid you would think I was being
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.120]   mean to you.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   Do you have no brain?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   Does your brain not work?
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.040]   Have you never thought about your finances?
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.200]   Have you never considered a single financial decision in your life?
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.780]   Maybe I'm being too hasty.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780]   After all I mean...
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.780]   Hold on.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.140]   I don't know everything about your finances.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.920]   After all I'm not your banker.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.740]   There might be something I don't know.
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.740]   Maybe...
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.740]   Did anybody die?
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740]   No, I don't see any.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.800]   Nobody died.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200]   Did somebody give you a big gift?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   No, that's a big gift.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   You would have...
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   I know you pretty well.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   You would have told me about it.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   No.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   You freaking idiot.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.140]   I cannot believe it.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.480]   You financed a stupid thing.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.920]   Oh, it makes sense.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.600]   Eighty-five percent of people who go out and buy a new car use financing because they're
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   idiots and have no money.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.260]   You know who uses financing to buy consumer crap?
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.240]   Like cars and trucks and motorcycles and all the other stupid consumer-grade crap?
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   Idiots.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   And idiots wind up broke every single time, all the time, because they're idiots.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040]   Yes, that includes you.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   Thank goodness.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   Let's go see.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   I wonder if...
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   Is there...
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   I wonder how...
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   Fifty-one thousand...
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Hold on.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   Which model is it?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.480]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.640]   That's what this stupid thing costs.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   Here I am on trucar.com and...
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   Hold on.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   Did I get the...
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   No, it's the other...
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   Okay.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   I got to get the crew cap.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Was it last...
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.720]   No, it's this year's model.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.520]   You couldn't even be smart enough to go and buy last year's model at the dealership or
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.440]   go at the end of the year when you could have...
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   Come on.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.020]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.840]   Do you know what you could do with fifty-one thousand dollars?
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   How do I know?
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Trucar.com, duh.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.520]   You're so stupid you didn't even think of shopping around.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.760]   You didn't think, "Oh, maybe I should go and actually do some research and pit a dealer
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.880]   against each other and use the internet.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.160]   After all, what is this internet thing that actually gets me good deals on stuff?"
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.800]   You wandered into the truck dealership and you wandered out with a truck.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.040]   No plan, no negotiating, no prearranged financing.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   You didn't go to your bank, your credit union.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.720]   You took the stupid loan that they sold you in the dealership, you idiot.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   They saw you coming and they started laughing.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.840]   They put you over their knee and they haven't stopped laughing yet.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.400]   Man, could you not be a little bit more intelligent?
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   I am so sick and tired of hearing about your problems and then you do something like this.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.680]   I thought it was bad, but now it gets worse.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   My goodness.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.880]   Okay, I get it.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.840]   Your car broke down.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.640]   Did you not think of fixing the car instead of buying a fifty-one thousand dollar pickup
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   truck?
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   I've spent a decent amount of money at the mechanic in my day, but I've never spent
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.960]   fifty-one thousand dollars there.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.040]   Oh, of course, you didn't have the money to fix it.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.960]   Yeah, because you're an idiot and you've never thought about saving money.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.400]   Did you never think about the fact that cars might break?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   You know what?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   Cars cost money.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.360]   Vehicles require repair and your body requires food.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   My goodness.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   My four-year-old has better forethought than you do.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.680]   Thank goodness.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.760]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.400]   Yeah, I know you're tired of trying to figure out a ride or figure out how to borrow a car,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.920]   but man, you could rent a car for cheaper than this thing.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   Okay, hold on.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Let's see here.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   Fifty-one thousand dollars.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.440]   So in the first year you own this thing, this stupid truck is going to lose twenty percent
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.680]   of its value in the first year.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.040]   Maybe even more because after all it's a pickup truck.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.960]   Okay, well maybe I guess there's a little bit of an argument that a pickup truck sometimes
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.440]   ... No, not this brand.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.160]   At least a Toyota pickup truck.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   If you bought a new one, it would have been a better buy than in the used market, but
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.640]   no, you bought a domestic pickup truck.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.080]   These things are ... Come on.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.120]   All right, so fifty-one ... Let's just keep it simple.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   Fifty thousand dollars.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.920]   Twenty percent of that truck's value means that you're going to lose ten thousand dollars
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   this year.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   Ten thousand dollars.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.080]   Are you such an idiot that you didn't stop and calculate the fact that you're going to
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.960]   lose ten thousand dollars this year on this stupid pickup truck?
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.760]   That's over eight hundred dollars per month.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.600]   Every single month.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.360]   Now let's do some math.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.840]   You earn thirty-four thousand dollars per year.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.440]   Yes, I know exactly how much you earn because the idiot leaves your personal documents lying
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.120]   around your house and of course I happen to care about money, so when I see ... Anyway,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.400]   whatever, you really should take better care of your stuff.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   Thirty-four thousand dollars per year.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.040]   That's because you make sixteen dollars an hour because you spend all your time hanging
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.000]   out on Facebook and hanging out on YouTube, reading car magazines and hadn't spent enough
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.120]   time open a book and learn how to get a decent job.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.520]   This month you're going to spend ... Let's see.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.640]   How many hours?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.880]   Okay, so thirty ... Ten thousand dollars.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.560]   Eight hundred and thirty-three dollars per month divided by sixteen dollars an hour.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   That means that this month you're going to spend fifty-two hours working a job that you
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   hate so your fat, shiny truck can sit there in the parking lot in the hot sun all day
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.240]   getting its paint messed up because you bought this stupid domestic truck.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.360]   They can't even put a paint job on the things.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.480]   You never looked around and looked at ... Okay.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.360]   But wait, it's worse.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   You bought this thing with post-tax dollars.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.480]   That's because after all, thirty-four thousand dollars a year, sixteen dollars an hour, you're
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   actually only making about thirteen dollars an hour if we factor in your employment taxes
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.400]   and your income taxes.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.680]   Oh, and it's worse than that because not only are you losing over eight hundred dollars
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:38.160]   a month on depreciation, but we have to add in financing costs because you bought a new
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.960]   one and we got to add in high insurance because you got to pay this big old insurance.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   Oh, and gap insurance.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.080]   I forgot about that because you didn't put any money down.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.200]   I bet you we're over a thousand bucks a month here.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   Very conservative.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   It's probably more.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   Okay.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   A thousand dollars a month.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Be conservative.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Be conservative.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   Over a thousand dollars a month in flat costs plus the cost of fuel and you bought a pickup
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   truck.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   Well, whatever.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   A thousand dollars a month.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   Okay.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   Thirteen dollars an hour.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   A thousand dollars a month.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   Do you know what that means?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.560]   That if you're making thirteen dollars an hour and spending a thousand dollars a month
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:33.480]   on this stupid piece of junk, that's over seventy-six hours this month that you're going
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.480]   to be working to pay for that stupid thing.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.600]   Man, do you not think?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   Seventy-six hours.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Over seventy-six hours.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.720]   That's almost two weeks of your life this month spent working to pay for this truck.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.920]   Do you realize that you only have about four weeks a month to work and you're spending
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.960]   almost half of them to pay for this truck?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.640]   Let's do this.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.280]   How many hours are you going to drive the truck this month?
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.400]   Let's say you live about twenty minutes from work.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.720]   Let's say that you drive one hour every single day.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   One hour of driving every single day.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.240]   Seven days per week to work, to the lake, whatever.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.280]   Seven days per week.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.200]   That's thirty-one days per month.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   At thirty-one hours of driving per month, you're going to be spending more time at your
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:32.080]   job working at a job you hate to earn the money to pay for a pickup truck that sits
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.240]   in the parking lot and gets destroyed by the sun than you are going to be actually driving
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   that thing.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.440]   You know, that's probably even too conservative.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.880]   That's less than that.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.440]   You're spending more time.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.240]   That's insane.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.880]   You are an idiot.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   You bought a pickup truck.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   Okay, fine.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.440]   Okay, I know you needed a car, but you bought a pickup truck?
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.800]   Do you know how stupid that pickup truck is?
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.040]   That is like the dumbest vehicle in the world for a dude like you to drive.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.580]   You live in Florida.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.240]   You have no ice, no snow, and it barely rains.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   And when it does rain, it's during the day when you're at work anyway because you're
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.240]   an idiot and you drive a pickup truck.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.800]   You don't need a pickup truck.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.040]   You live in a townhouse.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.960]   You don't live at the top of a mountain where you need a high-clearance, four-wheel-drive
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.760]   vehicle to get you up the mountain.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.480]   You live in a townhouse in Florida on paved roads.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.360]   My grandmother on her tricycle could get across the lawn.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   You think you need a pickup truck?
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.640]   Well, at least you bought a two-wheel-drive truck.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.280]   That was smart.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.560]   After all, two-wheel-drive truck has less issues.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.120]   It's a little more efficient to own, costs a little bit less.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.360]   But you know what?
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.560]   The whole reason you bought this truck was to make yourself feel like a man, and you
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   bought a two-wheel-drive truck, so now you look like a dweeb.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.840]   If you bought the thing for sex appeal because you wanted to drive a pickup truck, at least
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.040]   you could have been a self-respecting man who went all the way and bought a decent-looking
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.600]   pickup truck.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.040]   But now, no, you bought a two-wheel-drive pickup truck, and now you don't have the
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.720]   money to make it actually look cool.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.640]   You look like every other idiot driving a two-wheel-drive pickup truck.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   Maybe you can lower it.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640]   Oh, you're white.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.280]   You're not going to lower it.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   That doesn't work.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.400]   You're going to have to get yours and put on some stupid mud tires.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   Call up Fabtech or Fastech or whatever.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   Maybe you could put a topper on it, at least make it semi-useful.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.000]   I'll try you out with that stupid pickup truck.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.160]   No, no, because if you put a topper on it, you'll look like a dweeb.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.840]   You're going to go and get some stupid tonneau cover, and you bought a new one, so now you
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.000]   can't just go on Craigslist and pay $100 to get something that some other idiot is
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   selling.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Maybe you're going to go down to A.R.E. or whatever and pay $1,000 to get a custom-matched
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   paint cover.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   No, you don't have $1,000.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Oh, you're going to buy some stupid rubber thing that a thief can slice with a nail clipper.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   Steal all your stuff because you bought a pickup truck.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.400]   Oh, you put the stupid boxes in the thing.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.200]   Yeah, because the pickup truck is the most worthless vehicle ever.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.000]   It has no place to put things, and so you've got to buy extra boxes that look like they
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.840]   were manufactured in 1962 to put them in the bed, actually have a place to lock it up.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.360]   At least you bought a crew cab.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.880]   I'll give you that.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   After all, you aren't married.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.880]   Your wife wants kids.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.360]   Then again, have you never in your life tried to put a kid in a car seat?
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.760]   Have you never in your life tried to actually accomplish the contortions that are required
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.880]   with the giant car seats to get the kid into the thing when you got the stupid little weird
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.760]   door on the back of a crew cab of a pickup truck and you curled around it to buckle the
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.080]   kid in?
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   There's a reason many vans have sliding doors, just saying.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   You idiot.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.500]   Don't you know Home Depot rents pickup trucks?
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.400]   If you actually needed a pickup truck, you could just trot down to Home Depot or Lowe's
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.640]   and rent the stupid thing.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.600]   It's $19 plus what?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.800]   $50 will get you everything you need to know.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.520]   If you need a bigger one, uhaul.com, duh.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.400]   You won't even use the stupid new pickup truck because you're scared to scratch the bed.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:24.040]   Either you're not going to use it or you're going to wander down and pay $1,000 to protect
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   the bed.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.600]   That's how worthless these things are.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.720]   Or you could have bought a trailer.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   My goodness, $300, $400.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.200]   You could buy yourself a cheap utility trailer and it would have worked great.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.880]   Whole lot smarter than a stupid pickup truck.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880]   Come on, man.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.920]   At least if you were going to buy a pickup truck, you could have bought an intelligent
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   one.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   I will give you that you bought a crew cab.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   That was good.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   Okay.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.440]   But you could have at least bought a smaller one.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.360]   Dude, you're not a contractor.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.620]   You're not a farmer.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.440]   You don't haul tractors.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   What do you need?
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.920]   A pickup truck that'll haul a 24,000 pound trailer or carry 7,000 pounds of cargo in
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   the bed?
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.640]   You're a dude who drives to work from your little townhouse and you bought a pickup truck.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.240]   At least buy a smaller one or a cheaper one or a used one.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.640]   Or at least if you're going to buy a pickup truck, buy a sexy one.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.680]   You could have bought one that was more fuel efficient.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.640]   You don't need a V8.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.520]   You're not towing anything.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.320]   You could have bought one that was actually going to last you a long time, hand it down
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   to your kids.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.280]   Grandkids have a useful vehicle around the house, but no.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   You bought a Chevrolet.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.120]   Well, I can't keep a company out of bankruptcy.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.960]   At least they're making better cars than they used to.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.760]   But any of those options would have required a little bit of forethought, a little bit
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.280]   of planning, which my friend, I love you, but this is not your forte.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.840]   I wonder how much your interest payment is.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.280]   I wonder, are they doing any deals?
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.680]   I don't see no 0%.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   No special end of the year closeouts, no holiday sales.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.440]   Why did you buy this now?
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.440]   Oh yeah, your car broke.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   Oh.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.080]   I wonder, did you, no, you're not a member of a credit union.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.520]   Could have gotten a cheap loan from a credit union, but no, you're an idiot working with
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.640]   a bank.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   You know what?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:29.720]   You don't make enough money to qualify for this loan.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.080]   Your wife's got that dead end job and you've got this $34,000 a year, mostly dead end job.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.480]   You don't make enough money to, I bet, you know what?
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.540]   Tell me you didn't.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.920]   You co-signed it, didn't you?
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   Who was it?
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   Who?
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.920]   Your dad?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.880]   No, he would be smarter than that.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.960]   Your wife's dad co-signed for you.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.280]   Are you kidding me?
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.440]   What a sucker you are.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.080]   You have no self-respect.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.920]   This whole giant financial system wants to throw money at you and you're such an idiot.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.320]   You can't figure out how to get your own money.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   Now you got to go into business with your father-in-law?
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.920]   What a sucker he is.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.480]   He'll be paying that debt.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.800]   He's not realized that you're an idiot.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.160]   You can't seem to pay your bills.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.320]   You can't seem to think ahead.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   Thank goodness.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.920]   You're screwing up your marriage.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.640]   Man, I want so much better for you, but dude, you are screwing up your marriage by making
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.400]   stupid decisions like buying a pickup truck.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.360]   I've seen this again and again and again.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.040]   Why can we not say something?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.400]   No, if I put this, it'll just start an argument.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.600]   Dude, listen to me.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.080]   Your wife wants to have a baby.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.400]   She says that all the time.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.280]   She wants to have a baby.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.060]   Most women do.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.800]   But she feels insecure about it because you can't afford it.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.960]   Do you know why you can't afford it?
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.120]   Because your stupid pickup truck is stealing all your money.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.740]   Do you want to know why your sex life sucks?
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.920]   Because the insecurity that she feels makes her feel unsafe.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.280]   When she feels unsafe, this hurts her self-confidence.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.600]   The loss of self-confidence makes her feel unattractive.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.280]   When she feels unattractive, she's not sexually confident.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.580]   When she's not sexually ... You finish the rest.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.540]   Why is she not attracted to you?
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:32.300]   Because you're an idiot and you don't give her any decent reason to do it.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.540]   Your wife wants 2.7 children, or at least that's what every other woman reports.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.240]   I don't know what her exactly, that's between you and her, but on average, she wants 2.7
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   children.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.620]   But you don't have the money to pay for them.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.680]   So you'll send mama off to work because you're too impotent to earn a decent income and too
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   much of an idiot to make a plan for the future.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.660]   You know what she finds sexy?
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.420]   A man with a plan.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.680]   There was a time in which you actually had a plan.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.220]   You actually tried, but now you're an idiot and your plan goes as far as, "Oh, our car
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.220]   broke so let's go buy a pickup truck."
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.660]   You ain't got no plan because you're acting like a childish idiot.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.900]   At least a child is cute.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.780]   At least a child can be encouraged and directed, but you're a grown man.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.780]   You're not cute.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.140]   You're an idiot.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.700]   You wonder why she doesn't find you attractive?
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.860]   Because you don't make a freaking plan.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   You know who has a plan, buddy?
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   Mama's boss.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.420]   After all, why do you think he's a boss?
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.620]   Because he actually made a plan and followed it.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.660]   You know what mama finds sexy?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.340]   A man with a plan.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.580]   Not a man with a pickup truck, a man with a plan.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.940]   Do you see where I'm going here?
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.380]   Oh, Joshua, too strong.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.780]   Tell me, have you never in your life sat down for a beer with a divorced man and asked him
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.780]   how it happened?
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.300]   Oh, wait, I forgot you can't afford beer because you have a pickup truck.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   Have you never turned on the internet?
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.380]   Have you never listened to a country song?
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.140]   You never wondered why country songs are filled with guys with pickup trucks who come home
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.260]   to find their wife in bed with another man and thought there might be a connection?
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.260]   Stupid pickup trucks.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.260]   Hey, she likes it.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.580]   Oh, you say she likes it.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.380]   She likes it because she's hoping it'll make you happy.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.860]   She's likes it because she's hoping it'll make you feel more self-confident so that
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:31.100]   you'll actually make a plan, go for a promotion, get a better job, because all those things
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.060]   would actually increase your sex appeal and she wants you to be happy.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.300]   She's thinking maybe a pickup truck would be fun, maybe it'll help you.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:45.420]   But dude, listen, when you bought a pickup truck, she wasn't seeing it sit in the parking
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.340]   lot, get destroyed by the sun.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.580]   She was thinking of it hooked up to a wakeboarding boat, parked down at the boat ramp.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.460]   She was imagining herself out on the wakeboarding boat and imagining how great you'll think
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.300]   she looks in her bikini on the tube behind.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.500]   But you didn't think about that when you bought the stupid pickup truck.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.860]   You could have paid $2,000 and bought a pickup truck that was cheap and that was old and
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.700]   could tow your boat down to the boat ramp and you would have had enough money to buy
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.120]   a boat.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.100]   But now you're broke.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.620]   You have no money to buy a boat because you're broke because you bought the stupid pickup
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.620]   truck.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.200]   Heck, if you'd made a plan, you could have realized that there are a bazillion ways where
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.820]   you could actually go out and enjoy a Saturday together that don't cost you a ton of money.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   You actually have some time with her.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.500]   A little bit of time not spent complaining about your stupid dead-end job would sure
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.220]   help your marriage.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.260]   Have you never read a book on foreplay?
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.020]   It doesn't start five minutes before, it starts the morning before.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:51.780]   Do you know that they rent canoes down at the lake for $15 an hour?
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.820]   You don't need a pickup truck to buy a canoe.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.900]   I know you were thinking that.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.540]   You were thinking, "I got to actually own a pickup truck so I can buy a canoe."
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.620]   Just go rent the stupid thing.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.900]   But actually invest some effort.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.900]   Rent the canoe, $15 an hour.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.100]   Want a wakeboarding boat?
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.940]   Rent one of those for $150 a day, gas included and you don't have to wash the thing out when
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.540]   you're done.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.900]   If you did that every single Saturday, four days a month, that would still be less than
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.740]   your stupid pickup truck is costing you this month.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.220]   My goodness.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.260]   I'm being too hard.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.420]   No, I'm not.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:39.060]   If you don't get busy, your stupid pickup truck is going to cost you your life and it
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   may cost you your wife.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:45.020]   That would be a good thing, you have a pickup truck because you need some place to sleep
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.100]   when she walks off with all your money, your house, half your income for the rest of your
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.180]   life because of your emotional abandonment and abuse.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.180]   Doubt me?
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.180]   Good grief.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.940]   Grow a pair of balls, walk down to the local bar and actually talk to some guy who's been
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.940]   there.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.900]   Or if you can't do that, go online.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.020]   Yes, indeed.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.500]   When you spend all your time working to pay for your stupid pickup truck because you thought
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.220]   she wanted a pickup truck, she now interprets that as emotional abandonment and believes
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   it gives her a rock solid reason to get a wee bit closer with her boss.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   Think about it.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.060]   He's not tired from working a job to pay for a pickup truck that's rotting in the parking
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]   lot.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.820]   He is emotionally available.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.340]   He's not an idiot with no plan.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.740]   He's got a plan.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.260]   He's not some broke loser who can't afford to have a baby.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.260]   He actually has money and he has a clue about life.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.260]   You don't.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.900]   Now listen, dude, I'm yelling at you because I love you and I hurt for you and this is
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.860]   just like one thing.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.380]   Do you not see the connection?
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.500]   Do you not see that you've been doing this for a decade?
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.420]   You've never sat down and thought about your money.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   You've never made a plan.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.780]   She wants to buy a house, wants to redecorate the kitchen.
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.060]   I got no money.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:04.580]   It's because you bought a freaking stereo and then you bought a motorcycle and now you
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:14.740]   bought a $51,000 pickup truck.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.100]   You're screwed, buddy.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.620]   You got no way out.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.820]   You're upside down.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.900]   This loan, you'll never sell the thing for what you owe on it.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.900]   I don't know, maybe if you returned it today, you might get your money back.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.900]   No, hold on.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900]   When did you post this on Facebook?
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.340]   No, too late for that.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.620]   You're screwed, buddy.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.340]   There's no escape plan.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.340]   You've been so stupid.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.580]   It's all your fault.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:49.620]   You're going to reap a long, long harvest of pain.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.780]   You could get it together.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:57.180]   You could sell the thing, recognize your loss, stroke a check, chalk it up to stupid tax
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.020]   because you've been stupid, or you can keep going through this pain for a very long time.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.380]   Dude, listen, don't get me wrong.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:10.420]   I think pickup trucks are fine if you're a trucker or a cowboy or you actually need the
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.420]   thing.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.780]   If you want to buy one for fun, go for it, but get rich first, then get a pickup truck.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.740]   Please, dude, I beg you.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.020]   Stop doing stupid stuff with your life.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.020]   Please, stop it.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:35.180]   You keep doing stupid stuff like this again and again and again, and you're going to wind
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:42.340]   up getting screwed again and again and again.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.180]   I got no idea what to tell you about this stupid truck, but dude, what are you going
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.180]   to change?
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.820]   When are you going to think?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.820]   This is all related.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.860]   It's not like pickup trucks and your money are not related.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:02.100]   The reason you're broke is your pickup truck, but the reason you bought your pickup truck
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.220]   is because you don't think about the future.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.820]   You can't delay gratification.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.220]   You can't make a plan to actually save 500 bucks to go to the mechanic because your car
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.340]   is going to break down.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.660]   The fact that you can't think and can't plan ahead is what keeps you from getting educated
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.940]   enough to get a decent job or at least getting a certification so you can add an extra couple
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.940]   bucks an hour.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.940]   Come on, man.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.980]   This is all related.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.700]   You're trying to spend money to make up for your emotional problems, and trust me, I know
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:43.860]   I stepped over the bounds a little bit in talking about your sex life, but a weak, emotionally
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.820]   impotent dude is not generally very attractive to women.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.020]   Now if you fix that, your wife will be fine.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.020]   She loves you, dude.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.020]   She cares about you.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.940]   You don't have to worry about her boss, but as long as you keep acting like an idiot,
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:08.380]   well, if he doesn't, you've got competition.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:15.300]   Then you come crying about how you're broke because you get divorced.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Think you're broke now?
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.820]   You'd be a lot broker then.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:24.860]   Oh, well, if only you'd ask a question.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:30.180]   I could help you, but I've learned stupid people like doing stupid stuff.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.900]   They don't ask people for help.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:39.380]   I'll just keep on being my boring old self and enjoy my little pickup truck that actually
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.740]   pulls something that was cheap.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.380]   I'll enjoy having money in the bank.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.260]   My wife and I will have great sex.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.260]   We'll enjoy a nice house.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.900]   Actually, the time and the money to use the thing, your problem.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   Whatever.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.060]   Make your bed and lie in it.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.820]   It's a free world.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.820]   Libraries exist.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820]   Internet exists.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.900]   Dude, there's freaking podcasts, YouTube channels all over the place.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.260]   But listen, could take an interest.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.460]   Anyway, better stop while I'm behind.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460]   Whatever, dude.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:23.300]   Wish you all the best.
