[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   What advice do you have for someone trying to figure out
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.280]   what could be their side hustle?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.680]   - I think the important thing is think about
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.340]   what you're getting asked to do constantly in your life.
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.920]   What are your friends asking you for help with?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.180]   What are the things that you're spending
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.720]   your quality time doing?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.020]   What are those things and can you monetize them?
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.520]   I've literally tried to monetize
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.940]   everything I love in this life.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.320]   And while that might sound like really creepy or cheesy,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.440]   it works for me.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.720]   I think it's like, what are the things that you enjoy?
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.400]   What are the things that people consider you
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.040]   an unofficial expert in?
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   And what are the businesses or side hustles
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.720]   that you would want to spend all day,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.640]   Saturday and Sunday doing?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.960]   Once you start to think about that,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840]   you might come closer to an idea.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.880]   The other thing to think about that I love to do
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.840]   is start tracking problems that you have every single day.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.500]   What are the mini problems you have
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.600]   from the second you wake up
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.520]   till the time you go to sleep?
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.440]   Businesses are created because of problems
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.400]   need to be solved.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600]   And if you start monitoring and figuring out
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.240]   what the common problems you or your friends have,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.180]   you might find yourself a really cool untapped business idea.
