[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's Q&A.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And for the first time, it's actually the live Q&A,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   where you can hear kind of that whole, you know,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   caller and host type of interaction.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Kind of cool, huh?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host here with you
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   today to answer your questions, although I'm not actually
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   answering them today.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   This show today is a little different than normal.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   This is the audio of that all-patron call
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   that I did a couple weeks ago.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   This is where, as a bonus for all patrons of the show,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I did about a two-hour Q&A.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And this is the audio from that call.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   A lot of good questions, hopefully some good answers,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   but that's up to you to decide.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Going to go ahead and release this audio.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I was thinking about just making it a patron-only file
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   or releasing it for the general public.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I decided to go ahead and release it for the general public.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   This is a little bit different from the normal style
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   of the show.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   This is not quite as polished.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   This is simply the unedited audio from the conference call.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So this was my first time hosting a large conference call
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   like this, so I was a little bit unsure of the etiquette
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   of how to ask the next person to go and all of those things.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So forgive my stumbling starts.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm getting a little bit better.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I've done three of them since then for patrons again.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But this one, I thought it was just interesting.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   There were some interesting questions.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I thought it'd be fun to go ahead and release to you all.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So I'm going to release the audio for, again,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   forgive my stumbling starts and also forgive the audio quality.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   The audio quality is not up to my usual standard simply due
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   to it being on a phone line.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And I didn't record the high-fidelity audio on my end.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I just recorded the phone line.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So it should be legible for you, but enjoy that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Before we get to that, two quick things.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And actually, I'm going to skip the ending announcements today,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and I'm just going to play this Q&A and not do a closeout for you.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But two things.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Let's take care of the sponsors of the day.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Sponsor of the day number one is Patrick Snow, the publishing doctor.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Patrick was recently on the show.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It was episode number 252, immediately before this one.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So he was on the show with a full interview talking about publishing
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   your own book.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I definitely would strongly recommend if you've ever thought about
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   publishing a book or if this is something that you might be interested in,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   check out that interview with Patrick and consider speaking with him to see
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   if he might be able to help you publish your book.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Patrick is my publishing coach working on the first Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   book, and he is helping me with that process.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'm publishing it myself and going through all that process with him.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   He's got all of the -- it's been great.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   He's got all the resources.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He's got all the guidance.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He's got all the suppliers.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   He's even got the templates of how to actually write a book.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So if you don't know how to approach it, he'll teach you actually the process
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   of how to actually sit down and begin your writing process.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And don't necessarily just sit down in front of a blank page.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's kind of a difficult way to do it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Connect with him and see if he might be able to help you out.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   A place to check him out is PatrickSnow.com, or if you're interested in
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   publishing, go to ThePublishingDoctor.com.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's also another interview that he's published on The Publishing Doctor
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   that you would enjoy listening to on the right-hand side.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   There is an interview with him talking about publishing and speaking.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The best way to get in touch with Patrick, if you're interested,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   he will offer you a complimentary 30- to 60-minute consultation to find out
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   your situation and see if he might be able to help you or not.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The best way to do that is to text him at 206-310-1200, 206-310-1200.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And that phone number will be in the show notes for today's show.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So again, with your phone, just pull up the show notes, click on that text
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   number, and shoot him a text message, and send him your name and your area
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   code -- excuse me, your time zone, name and your time zone, and he will
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   arrange a time to connect with you.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Sponsor of the day number two is You Need a Budget.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   This is the budgeting software that I use to run my personal family budget,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   and it is excellent.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Budgeting is one of the foundational skills.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It is one of those core attributes.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   If you look at any of the work on millionaires, millionaires all -- I shouldn't
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   say all -- a very high proportion of millionaires report having a budget,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   much higher than people who are not rich.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So budgeting is one of the core skills, but it's challenging to do when you've
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   got all these different accounts and you've got the money and the bank
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   account.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's easy if you just had dollar bills sitting on your desk, but it's hard
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   when it's just money sitting in your bank account.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You Need a Budget is the budgeting software system that makes that easy.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   They've got a really great computer program.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   They've got a really great smartphone apps.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It is excellent, excellent, excellent.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   When I found You Need a Budget for the second time, I immediately knew that
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   it was really good, and I switched all of my personal accounting over to the
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You Need a Budget software.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   If you'd like to listen to an hour-long interview and discussion and hear my
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   own personal story with You Need a Budget, listen to episode 246 of the show
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   with the founder of You Need a Budget, a man named Jesse Mecham.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Or if you'd just like to give it a shot, try a 30-day free trial at
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   So just type in radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab, Y-N-A-B, acronym for
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You Need a Budget, and you'll be able to download the software.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's the full version of the software, no hidden features or anything like that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's the full version, 30 days.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It'll work for you with 100% functionality for 30 days.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   If you don't like it after 30 days, then just cancel it and take it off, and
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   then you won't pay anything.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You don't even have to put your credit card number in to activate it.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But after 30 days, if you want to continue using it, then you'll pay for the
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   software then.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I can't remember.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's like $60, something like that.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So well worth it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Well worth it.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Check it out, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Only other announcements since I'm going to skip the ending announcements today.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   If you like the show, please tell a friend.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Tell them to search their app store on their phone for Radical Personal Finance
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and consider becoming a patron of the show also.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   This phone call that you're about to hear was a recording, again, of a
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   conference call that I did for all patrons.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And that was a unique thing for all patrons.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But I'm also doing, continuing to do these phone calls every week during
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   October and November for patrons who are supporting the show at $10 a month
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and up.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   So if that is you, go ahead and check the Patreon page for the information.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And if that's not you, go ahead and join.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And I will be hosting the audio of these calls on the Patreon page of the
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   past ones so that you can listen to those bonus episodes.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And if you go ahead and join now at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   you'll be able to join the weekly calls here during the month of October
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and November.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And so with that, here is the call.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   [Phone ringing]
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   There we go.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And we're going to get started.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So I'm not -- this is just simply a phone only.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'm not going to be sharing a screen.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's actually one of the things that reasons why I'm doing a phone
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   conference.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I realized I've been offering for all the patrons of the show a monthly Q&A
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   call.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And what I intended to do was I intended to do that as a Google Hangout.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And I never grew up in the era of phone conferences.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   For me, you know, doing a conference is just always a video conference.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   But with moving the last couple of months and various things,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   it's been challenging for me to do the video thing consistently.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It requires me to have a good internet connection.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It requires me to put on a shirt that I feel happy, you know,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   showing up on a video camera with.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It requires me to have a good background.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And so what I decided to do is instead of doing the video conference,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   just do a phone conference.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And so I wanted to do it today because I missed some of the patron benefits.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I'm here to answer questions one by one.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'll answer as many questions as I can.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And I'll answer as many questions as I can.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I'll spend as much time here as I can, and we'll just see how it goes.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But I'm fully available to you guys.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I hope it's easier for you to call in and easy for me to answer.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Let me start with just who would like to ask a question,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and we'll kick it off and get right to the content.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Who wants to go first?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Yeah, Susan, go ahead.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's kind of a question, kind of a comment.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And maybe this just applies to me because I'm older,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   but I'm not as technically savvy.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   But I was wondering if maybe, like,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   with all of the different technologies that you're using,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and I think kind of the Facebook one that you were planning on doing,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   are you still planning on doing that, like, every other Friday or something?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Because I haven't -- and I know you've been having problems,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   but I don't know if it ever worked.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I don't know, like -- I was wondering if you can do step-by-step instructions
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   on how to get into some of this stuff and what we're supposed to do
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and what level of person it's for, patron it's for.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Right.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So with the patron program,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   the basic thing that I was looking to do with the patron program,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   most of the content is found on the actual Patreon site.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And I have been slow on delivering the content.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I've just been overwhelmed on my end.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And over the last month especially,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I've made good progress on really increasing things.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   But on the patron site, if you go right to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   that works in many ways almost like a Facebook wall does.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So that's where I'm posting the show episode that's coming up,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   taking specific questions on there.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   You can comment and coordinate with other people who are patrons of the show.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   At the $25 and up level, that is where there's access to the Facebook group.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So if you are at the $25 and up level
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and you don't have access to the private Facebook group,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   then make sure that you email me,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, and I'll make sure that you have access.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I try to do a good job of staying on top of that.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And then in that group, there's over 60, about 65 members there right now,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   all of whom are interacting and answering each other's questions,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   some really smart people there.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And then that's where I try to spend a good time every other day or so,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   going into that group and trying to answer questions there personally.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So some of what you're talking about was me trying to do Google Hangouts.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And the Google Hangout system was just a disaster.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It always had problems.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I never got the right people invited.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It just didn't work.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And so I scrapped that whole thing and gone to this for now.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And we'll see if I switch to another platform in the future.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   That help, Susan?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Yeah, I guess that didn't answer the question,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   because I guess I need to up my level, because I was thinking.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I thought the $10 got to at least the Facebook, but I guess not.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   But that gets you something, obviously, right?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Right.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   The reason for the confusion may have been what I did with the original
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   people who signed up for the original membership program.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Then with that group of people, I was charging $10.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And so all of those people were grandfathered in at the $25 level.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The $10 a month gets you access to the live monthly Hangout,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and that's what I haven't been able to deliver the last two months.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So going forward over the next eight weeks, once a week,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I'm going to be doing one of these conference calls,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and that's open to the $10 and up level,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   where I'll be answering as many questions.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   We can talk specific -- not specific,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and answer any question, and I'll do my best to help out.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So next question.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Hey, Josh.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Josh, I'm up.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   This is Nate.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Can you hear me all right?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Nate, I can hear you.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Welcome.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Let's go with your question first.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So I wanted to ask you a question related to social capital
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   versus financial capital.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Right.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I don't know if you want me to provide some context
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   on how that relates to my situation?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah, please do.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Okay.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Basically, your podcast has had a major impact on my life this last year,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   probably 75% of the reason why I was able to quit my job.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And just from listening to your podcast,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I'm super stoked to be a member, a supporter.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I really appreciate everything you do.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And I'd kind of like to just get your advice on our situation.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I kind of consider us cash flow retired at this point.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   We don't have huge savings or investments or anything,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   but I have some online businesses.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I sell handmade products on a couple different websites through Etsy
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and others and covers all of our expenses plus a couple thousand dollars a month
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   that we're able to save.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   At this point, it only takes four to ten hours per week to manage everything,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   so I have a lot of free time on my hands.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   My wife doesn't need to really work, so she has a lot of free time on her hands.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   It's myself, my daughter, and we've got another one on the way in March.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Congrats.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Thank you.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   But we've just been using our time to develop fun hobbies that are financially
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   beneficial, which we kind of learned through your interview with Jacob Lund Fisker.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So we're focusing on valuable hobbies like biking, filmmaking, gardening.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I'm just getting into hunting and foraging, permaculture-type stuff.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And your interview with Curtis Stone has got me now interested in this urban
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   farming thing.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And I've sort of launched one this year,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   HugsFarm.com, Hugs Urban Farm, it's an urban farming thing.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And I'm getting a lot of pushback from my wife because she sees all the huge time
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that it's taking me, the huge time commitment and the low payout.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And it's really good work.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I really enjoy being out in the sun, and I'm definitely starting to see some of
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   the social capital that comes along with it.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But it's a huge input, and my process for making my handmade products online is
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   totally repeatable.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I have it like fully systemized.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I'm an engineer nerd type person.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And in a few weeks, I can get another one of those going that's making good
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   profit.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And then I'm still around to hang out with her more and stuff.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   But yeah, I'm just trying to kind of struggle to make a strong case of how the
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   social capital is worth a lot to my wife.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   So I was wondering what your opinion is on that, the social capital versus
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   financial capital, and any opinions on situations when one might be worth
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   pursuing over the other, et cetera.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Is she upset about the fact that she thinks you should be making more money
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   with your time?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Is that what the conflict is?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think she just -- she's kind of a wanderlust, and she likes to travel around.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And we've been doing quite a bit of traveling these last couple years.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And the farming, the gardening thing, and pulling on that and starting to sell
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   the restaurants, it's just putting a lot of time into it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And I love it.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But she's more time of her just hanging out with Josie by herself now rather
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   than having me around.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And they hang out with us too on the farm, but she's a 2-1/2-year-old, so she's
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   more ripping stuff out of the ground and destroying it than helping.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So I'm just trying to make the case of how -- what your opinion is of how, if I
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   keep building this and develop good relationships in the community, is that worth
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   more, you think, than pursuing like real financial independence, I guess it
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   would be, where I should just keep trying to build the online businesses and get
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   us to a place where we can just be considered financially retired on paper, I
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   guess?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   What's your primary reason for doing the farming?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   What's motivating you to do it?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Well, I started doing it just as a value-added hobby.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Growing our own food, hunting our own food, stuff like that, it just -- it pays
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   dividends and it's -- I enjoy it a lot.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I've always kind of been -- I grew up on a little bit of a hobby farm, so I've
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   always enjoyed that connection to my food.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And then I just started selling stuff to a couple chefs I knew in town, sort of
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   friends of mine, and there was more demand, and now I'm getting -- I have
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   press -- there's a magazine in town that's published an article on our farm, and
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   it's kind of like building itself.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And I really enjoy it, so I kind of feel compelled to keep it going.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And I just love it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I mean, and Michelle likes it, too.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   My wife likes it a lot when she's helping.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   She just struggles with, you know, having a two-and-a-half-year-old now, another
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   one on the way, so she's kind of tied up with that more.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And we switch off every once in a while, but I just work a lot faster, more
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   efficiently, and more organized than her, so I've been doing the majority of it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Right.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So here are some thoughts that occur to me in thinking about the question.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I don't think of it being a social capital versus financial capital.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   The point that I try to make on the show and that I see is that we don't do a very
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   good job in our culture of recognizing the value of social capital.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   We're trained to only measure things in terms of financial results.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   But if you look at life a little bit more broadly, you can see that social capital
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   does have a tremendous value, and I'll give you two examples at opposite ends of
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   the spectrum.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   When I graduated from college, I decided I wanted to go on a road trip, and I had
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   some time off.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I quit my job, and I wanted to go travel.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   So I went on Facebook, and I sent a mass email to everyone in my email address
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   book.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I went on Facebook.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I Facebooked every one of my friends, and I said, "I'm taking a road trip.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I want to come visit you if I'm able to, and where do you live, and can I come see
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   you?"
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And I got back dozens and dozens of responses.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I took those responses.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I charted them on a map of the places where I had an invitation to come and spend
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   the night.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I charted them on a map with people that I knew, and that was how I set out my
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   itinerary, was I went from place to place, a friend's house to friend's house.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Usually stayed one night, sometimes two, sometimes three, but usually I just
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   stopped and kind of went on to the next place.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And I traveled for just under two months.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I went from Florida as far west as Colorado and up to Canada, and then all the
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   way back to Florida.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And I didn't spend a night paying for lodging, and I didn't sleep in my car.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I stayed at a friend's house every night.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And so the point of that is that just simply by just knowing casual acquaintances
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   and friends across the country, that I didn't need to spend $50 a night or $800
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   a night for hotel stays.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So if I were to take that and add it on to what I do now with Radical Personal
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Finance, now that effect would be even more amplified.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And so even though with Radical Personal Finance I'm not yet making a million
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   dollars a year with it, it's allowed me to build a worldwide network where I've
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   received invitations from people all over the world to come stay with them.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And if I wanted to go and travel with my family, then I guarantee all of you on
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   the call today and many people all around the world, if they knew I were coming
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   to Italy or knew I was coming to Georgia or knew wherever, I would have
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   invitations, and many of you would invite us to stay the night.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Many of you would feed us dinner.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   So there's a real social benefit to this business, and that was something that
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I didn't have with my previous firm.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So I walked away from more money at my previous firm, but now I have the
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   potential to make more money now, and I have a much broader range of benefits.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So from the little scale to the big scale, a few weeks ago I read a book called
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "Clinton Cash," and it was all about President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and what they've been doing since Bill Clinton was out of office.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And one of the things that he's done is he's leveraged his connections and his
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   place of being the president, and he's leveraged that to, I think, build a
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   network of--I don't remember the exact numbers, but something that went from
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   being worth a few million bucks when he left office to being worth, I think,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   $300 million, something like that, with speaking fees.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   He's gotten paid speaking fees as high as, I think, $1 million to go and give
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   a single individual one-hour speech around the world.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Now, what he was actually doing in that talk was he wasn't just getting paid
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   for the content of the hour, but he, according to the author Peter Schweitzer,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   wrote the book, and this is the case he sets to prove, he's peddling his
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   influence, and he is selling his influence around the world and selling the
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   influence of his wife as Secretary of State, and that has resulted in him and
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   his foundation and them becoming very, very wealthy because of the influence
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   that they're peddling.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   So my point with demonstrating social capital is that if you look at the world,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   if you don't have social capital, then you've got to rely entirely on financial
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   capital.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   If you don't have friends around the country, you've got to pay for a night
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   in a hotel all around the country.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But if you have friends all around the country, you don't really have to stay
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   in a hotel and you can leverage your friends.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   This is what poor people can do, and this is also what rich people do.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   If you look at the things that people get done, the person who, you know, for
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   example, if you're going to join a board, a nonprofit board, your requirements
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   to join a board are the ability to leverage influence.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Either that influence comes from your ability to write big checks or that
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   influence comes from your ability to compel other people and encourage and
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   persuade other people to write big checks.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So the point is to demonstrate that building social capital is valuable and
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   you don't just have to be a millionaire.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   If you can control the money, partly through social capital, you can accomplish
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   massive change even if you're not rich.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So that's one aspect of it.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   When it comes to actually deciding what to do, I think a thoughtful way to
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   approach that would be to say, "Let me get clear on what the change is that I'm
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   actually trying to accomplish, and let me see how can I affect it."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   If you look at the way that the mega-rich people run their money, you go through
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   a series of steps.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   The first step is building basic financial security, and you can go back to my,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   you know, seven steps of financial security.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I won't go through that whole thing.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Basically, you go through financial security, you go through some, you know,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   getting out of debt, you go through some basics of building a comfortable,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   luxurious lifestyle for yourself, and then you go through maintaining
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   financial independence.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Once you get to financial independence, what you find is that people spend their
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   time and their money investing in the causes of change that are important to them.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So whether it's Bill and Melinda Gates trying to wipe out, you know, various
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   diseases and trying to vaccinate every child throughout the world, or whether
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   it's Warren Buffett trying to, you know, contributing millions of dollars to
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Planned Parenthood, and thanks to his wife, Suzy, because that was a cause for him,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   or whether it's the local business person who's trying to accomplish something,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   you see that people focus on the change that they want to see.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So my point is, why should I bother to wait to be a mega-billionaire?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I don't need to be a mega-billionaire to make a change.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So when you come down to something like urban farming, the reason that that's
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   important to me is because I see that one of the causes that I want to promulgate
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   is personal freedom, self-reliance, and independence, and that's the anarchist
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   streak that I have to encourage people to be able to provide for themselves.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   So when people take over control of their own food supply and are able to feed
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   their families, when people take and build community in their local space of--
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   when people take and build community in their local space, what they're actually
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   doing is they're taking back sovereignty over their own situation,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and taking back control over their food might lead them to setting up
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   a local economy. Setting up a local economy might lead them to get out
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   of other systems that I don't particularly love that run our nation
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   on a national basis. So even if you look at social capital, I've been able
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   to leverage the message that was important to me of urban farming
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   and local autonomous food production without having to go into it myself.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So you've got to look at your life and ask yourself, "Why am I doing
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   what I'm doing?" If your family is suffering because of your building
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   a local farm, well, I wouldn't make that trade. I'm not doing local farming
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   myself because at the moment I have much bigger opportunities
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   with radical personal finance. And if I spend time out in the yard,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   digging in my yard, that's time that I can't be putting into another project
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   where I can reach thousands more people. But I'm still accomplishing
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   with the leverage of my social capital. I'm still influencing people like you
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and several others who write me notes and giving them an opportunity
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   for an independent business that they can do in their own backyard.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And that's helping them to build financial independence,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and that's accomplishing my goals. So my goals are to help people
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   build independence, and the farming is just a tool in that.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Go back to your goals. Consider what your goals are, and then ask yourself,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   "Is what I'm doing, how does it fit into that in the scope of my life?"
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Is that helpful, Nate?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   That's extremely helpful and extremely valuable. But I don't know
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   if I can repeat all that to my wife. Can you send me that recording?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I think right now it should be recording, so I think we're good.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Cool. Yeah, I really like the idea you said about building a local economy
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and how through social capital you are essentially building a local economy.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And organizing and running a local economy is just guaranteed to trickle down
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   into wealth in your life. And sometimes I hate this.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I hate to equate friendships with calling it capital, equating it with financial means,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   but it just feels good, so that's why I've been doing it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It's obvious how good it feels, and you just start to realize it's more about money.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But it's really helpful how you kind of explain how the financial rewards
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   pretty much always come from doing that.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Right. Thank you so much.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Good. I hope it's useful.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I wrote down your website. Tell me again. It was hugsurbanfarm.com?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   It's actually just hugsfarm.com.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You'll see Hugs Urban Farm, our logo on there and everything when you go there.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Hugsurbanfarm@gmail.com is just my email.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Cool, man. Keep up the good work. That's awesome to hear.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And if I can help in any way, once you get it going, let me know.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   As far as track your numbers, track your experience, and maybe I'll have you on the show.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   We'll do an interview at some point to share it with others.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Since the Curtis Stone interview, I know of at least a half a dozen listeners
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   who have started their own urban farm, started microgreens businesses, things like that,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   to bring in some extra money and start to build a little bit of autonomy for themselves.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   I love hearing those stories.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I'm just getting the microgreens going right now and winding down the farm for the season.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I'm super psyched, and I'll definitely keep in touch.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   If you ever want to hear more about stuff I'm doing with Handmade, that's really cool, too.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I kind of etched it all out, sent it to my little brother and sister, so I've got an outline.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   It's kind of fun to talk about, too.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Shoot it over, and then I'll read the outline, and we'll correspond,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and maybe that will be helpful to other people on the show.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So, yeah, shoot me an email. Awesome.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   All right, thanks, Josh. I appreciate everything.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   No problem. Next question. Who's got a question?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Joshua, this is Mark from Grand Rapids.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Hey, Mark.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I have a question about--hi.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I have a specific question about when you would want to consider gifting appreciated assets
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   from a taxable account in lieu of doing a cash donation.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   When is that beneficial to a dual-income family, so in a high-tax bracket?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I don't know if you need more details than that or not to answer the question.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I've heard about this as a strategy, but I don't really know too much about it
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   or when we'd want to consider that.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   It's a simple answer, so let me just give you the simple answer,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   and if I need more details, I'll tell you.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   The rule with appreciated assets is, number one, you gift them when you don't want to own them anymore.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   So if you know that I don't want to own them and I want to make the gift,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   then you look to say, "What's the best asset for me to give?"
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   An appreciated asset, let's say that you've got $100 of cost basis,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   you paid $100 for it, and the asset is worth $200.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   So you want to give a contribution of $200 to a charity.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   If you sell the asset in the open market for $200,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   then you're going to incur the tax on $100 worth of gain.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   So you sell it for $200, you pay the tax at $15, and you can only give $185 to the charity.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   If you gift the appreciated asset, the $200 to the charity,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   you can give them $200 and you take the full deduction of $200,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   whatever the fair market value is of the asset.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   So the rule is you always gift appreciated assets instead of cash
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   if you have them to give and you decide if you want to get rid of them.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Let me give you the other side so it's clear.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   If you have depreciated assets, you paid $200 for the investment,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   you lost money, and now it's worth $100,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   then the rule with depreciated assets is you always sell the asset first,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   take the loss on your taxes, and then gift the cash.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   So if you sell the asset for $100, then you recognize the $100 loss,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   and then you go ahead and give the $100 to the charity.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   So if you don't want to own the asset, if you're happy with it,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and if the charity actually has the ability to receive the asset,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   take care of the title transfer, and sell it,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   then you always want to gift the appreciated asset and not cash.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Okay. So the key piece to that seems to be if you want to sell it anyway,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   but what if it's just depreciated?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   I mean, is there any advantage to -- if we can do either,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   we can give to the charity from cash or we can sell some of our --
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   or not sell but transfer some of our appreciated assets directly to the charity.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Is there any benefit to doing that,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   or is it only if you wanted to get rid of it anyway?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   What type of asset and what type of dollar value?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Let's say $2,000, and it's a mutual fund in a taxable Vanguard account,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   just an index fund.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And what's the appreciation in the account?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   What's the cost basis of the account?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   This is hypothetical, but --
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Okay.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   So I guess pick a number.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Let's say it's 30% higher than when I bought it a couple years ago.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   All right.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Well, if we're talking about --
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   so usually when people are going to get into the world of gifting appreciated
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   assets, most of the time you're going to be dealing in, okay,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I've got a $200,000 piece of property,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   or I've got a $60,000 classic car or something like that,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   where you're talking larger numbers.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   If you're talking about a couple thousand bucks, in the scale of your life,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   it's probably not that big a deal.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And so look at what the actual benefit is of the transaction
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   and ask yourself if it's worth it.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Let's say that we're talking about a $2,000 gift, and you've got a 30% gain.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So let's say your cost basis is $1,500.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Well, if you gift a $2,000 asset -- excuse me,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   if you gift a $2,000 appreciated asset to the charity,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   then you're going to avoid paying the tax on the $500 worth of gain.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Well, if you're paying a 15% long-term capital gains rate,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that's saving you 75 bucks.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So is the savings of 75 bucks worth the hassle of doing the paperwork and all
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   of that?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I would probably -- maybe, maybe not.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   But that is that you're basically just saving the tax on the appreciated
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   asset.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So it's got to be worth the hassle to deal with it.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   If it's a marketable security, you can just go out and buy the same thing.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   You can give the $2,000 and then take cash from your checking account
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and go and buy the Vanguard mutual fund again at current rates.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Then, yeah, there's no reason not to.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   It's just worth the hassle.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Usually with appreciated assets, you're going to get into that when we're
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   talking a $50,000 piece of land and you don't want to recognize it and pay
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   $5,000 of capital gain.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Sure.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   I think I understand.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And I guess to be a little bit more specific,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   so instead of doing like a monthly gift to our church of cash,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I was thinking of instead either doing a monthly or annual,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   if it's easier, just an annual one-time gift of $2,000,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   $3,000 or whatever.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   If I could find a way to automate that like I do with just the cash gift,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   would that be something to do if it wasn't too much of a hassle?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It sounds like, hey, if it's not too much of a hassle,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   it would be beneficial on your taxes to be able to do that.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Like you said, I would just go -- I'd still have the cash then that I would
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   have otherwise donated, so I would just go and buy more of the Vanguard fund
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   or whatever to replace it in my account.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   It sounds like there is some benefit there.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It's just a question of how much it is.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Right, right.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And it's got to be practicality.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Is the church a big church where they've got somebody who's used to that,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   or is it a small church, 200 people type of thing?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I know they do have the capabilities, but since I've never done it,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I don't know how well it works or if it's a manual process
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   or if I can just tell Vanguard here, send it here every month or what.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And that's something I'll have to do some research on.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   But, yeah, thanks for your call on that.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It could totally work.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   My guess is, depending on the size of the church,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   so some churches would have the staff and the infrastructure ready
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   where they could actually do that.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   But a small church is probably going to be more hassle,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   and basically what you'd be doing is asking, say, the treasurer
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   or somebody like that who might be a part-time volunteer
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   to do a bunch of paperwork, title transfer, liquidate the asset.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And if you're doing it for $75, I think it's probably more hassle
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   than it's worth.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   But if you're doing it as a one-time thing, you've got a $10,000 inheritance
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   or whatever, then do that.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   So just ask yourself if it's worth the scale.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Conceptually, it'll work.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Do you have any plans to do a podcast on charitable giving in general,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   like different strategies and things?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I've got like six books that I want to go through
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and talk about charitable strategies.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   The challenge for me is simply at this point in time figuring out
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   what's the next thing that I should really be focused on
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and what's the priority.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   So at some point I will, yeah.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   But in essence, it's simple.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Appreciated assets always give the asset, not the cash.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Depreciate it, sell the asset, give the cash.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Awesome.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Cool.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You're welcome, man.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Next question.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Who wants to go?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It's Nick here.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Nobody else has something to ask?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   All right.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Go, Nick.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I've got like four questions I owe you answers on Q&A,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and I apologize.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   They're on my list, and I haven't done them yet.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   That's okay.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Some of those I can be patient on.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I was thinking just based on listening to some other people's questions,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I guess I had a pointed question here.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Depending on how I calculate things and how my expenses go the next few years,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I'm anywhere from, you know, four to 14 years from financial independence,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   depending on how things go, at least what I consider to be financially independent.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And I have a whole range of questions about, you know,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   becoming self-employed from being a current employee and all that stuff.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   But one thing that's kind of been gnawing at the back of my mind is about once --
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   let's say tomorrow magically I hit the number that's in my head to become
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   financially independent, and I wanted to flip the switch
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   and turn those, you know, savings vehicles into distributions to myself
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   to start living off of that money.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   The reason I'm curious about it so early is just because it's always a mental
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   weight on me to know if once I hit that number if it's actually going to mean
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   anything.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And specifically, let's say I have, say, half of my money in, you know,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Vanguard index funds, and the other half are between me and my wife are in IRAs
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and 401(k)s that, you know, the financial institutions that our company has picked.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   What is the -- other than changing from, say, you know, 95% stocks and 5% bonds
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   in my Vanguard index funds and maybe switching around the allocations
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   appropriately, what is the actual distribution of income look like from having,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   say, you know, a pot of savings to actually living off of that savings?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   What are the mechanisms that happen there when you make that switch?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   If that question makes sense.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Right. I understand.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   By the way, first of all, congratulations on the baby.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I forgot to say that.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Thanks. Thank you.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   I got the email.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I appreciate your letting me know.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Yeah, that's one of the reasons my expenses are unknown for foreseeable next year.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   We'll see how they level out with my cash flow statements.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Indeed. Indeed.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   The making of that switch is -- the answer to the question is the frustrating answer of it depends.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   But I'm going to give you some scenarios so that it's not -- and I'll just leave it as it depends.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   It depends on what are the sources of income.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   It depends on what is the age of retirement.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   It depends on what's the makeup of the assets.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And it depends on what is the goal of -- what are you actually going to do
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   during financial independence.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   You've got to realize with regard to the financial independence community, almost nobody actually fully retires.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   So the number of people who are actually following the plan of saying I've saved a million dollars
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and now I'm going to sit back and do nothing, almost nobody actually does that.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Almost everybody who becomes financially independent continues to work in some way
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   or has some source of income and they just have the confidence and the satisfaction of knowing,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   well, at least I don't have to.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   I'm doing this because I want to and not because I have to.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And you can go through everything --
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Yeah, that's exactly where I'm trying to get to, just to have those bases covered
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   so I can go do more meaningful work in the world and affect more people possibly,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   including making my own work more rewarding.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   That's exactly my goal.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Right. I guess I can't divorce that from the actual distribution because it will affect --
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Right. And so what I am convinced of, and this is my opinion,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I'm convinced we ought to at least acknowledge that.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And as proof of that, for example, I just interviewed a couple of weeks ago from FinCon,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I just interviewed Brandon, a mad scientist, and his wife, Jill,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   and I'm going to be playing that interview at some point on the show in the next few weeks at least.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And so Brandon, he hit his financial independence date and he's still working
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   because his employer offered him a job and he likes doing it and his wife is working.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   So even though he has the ability, he's actually still saving,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   even though he hit financial independence.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Jacob, early retirement extreme, he took a job, not because he had to, but he took a job.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Pete, Mr. Money Mustache, he makes more money now on his blog than he ever did before as an engineer.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And I'm sure, although he doesn't say this on the blog and I have no inside knowledge,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   I would be willing to bet a good amount of money that he's not living off of his index funds,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   that he's spending the money from his earned income.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   And so what this opens up, I believe, is that you don't have to wait to be, you know,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   to have the $1.925 million to pretend like you're financially independent.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   You need $30,000 or $130,000 or $430,000 to get you through.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Now, what you really need is what you're asking about, which is the income plan.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And that's where it comes down to what are the numbers.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   The reality is most people who are pursuing this early retirement,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   early financial independence lifestyle, they're going to be earning something.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And so what I would be concerned, what I wouldn't want to see doing,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   let's say that you were a 65-year-old retiree.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   As a 65-year-old retiree, then the planning process is a little bit simpler.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   We know what your Social Security distributions are.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   We generally are going to be able to sketch out a lifestyle that is going to be fairly --
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   you're going to have a good sense of where you are.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Most people who are 65 years old and retiring aren't sitting down and saying,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   well, I don't know, I might have more kids, we might want to move, I might want to pay for this.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Most retirees, they've had those major expenses.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And so we can sketch out you want to live on $5,000 a month.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   And then you say, based on our assets, we're going to set up -- you've got Social Security of $2,000 a month.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   We're going to set up annuity payments of $2,000 a month.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   That gives you a baseline income of $4,000.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Then we're going to take X percent distributions from the 401(k),
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and that's going to cover you anywhere on the extra $2,000.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   If you have lots of surplus of money, retirement planning is easy.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   So for people that have $5 million in the bank and they want to spend $8,000 a month,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   that's easy because you don't have to worry about fluctuation.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And you can put a lot of -- you can keep the account invested aggressively.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   You can keep it primarily in stocks.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Because you've got such a margin of safety, you can go for highest overall rate of return.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   When people are just barely squeaking by with retirement, they just have enough,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   then what happens is you actually have to go safer in order to guarantee that minimum lifestyle.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And so the flexibility, if somebody is willing to be flexible with their income,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   the toughest type of traditional retirement planning to do is somebody who is not willing to be flexible with their income.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   I've got to have $5,000 a month.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   If the market's down and I have $3,000 a month, that's a total failure.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I've got to have this level.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Well, in that case, you move in the direction of safer investments, less volatility,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   more fixed products, annuity products, guaranteed streams of income, things like that,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   because they're not willing to be flexible.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   You have somebody that says, "Hey, I could live on three or I could live on seven,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   and it's not really that big of a deal."
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Now you can go away from guaranteed products.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   You can go to a more volatile investment portfolio,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   which in the aggregate will produce a higher total return with more fluctuation.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   For the early retiree, you can do the same exact thing.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   All right, I'd like to spend $4,000 a month.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   I could get by on three because I have no debt or minimum mortgage, but I'd like to make seven.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I think I might make a couple thousand dollars a month with this part-time deal.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   In that case, I would just be okay with doing from time to time distributions from a stock portfolio,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   where you look and say, "What's the dividend rate of my portfolio?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Could I live on the dividends, or do I have a piece of real estate,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and so I can keep invested for maximum return?"
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   If I were, say, how old are you going to be in four or five years, Nick?
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   About 41.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Okay, so if I were 41, and I were, without giving away any of your personal details,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   if I were going to be 40, and that was what I was shooting for for my financial independence day,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   knowing that I've got a couple of part-time businesses,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   what I would do is I would have some assets that are very, very stable from a cash flow perspective.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   I would probably do that with a couple of pieces of real estate.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   If you're okay with a little bit of management or something like that,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   because that's very, very stable from an income perspective,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   then I would set up the taxable portfolio,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and I would try to see if I were willing to live on just the dividends plus a little bit.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Then I would keep enough money in cash to know that I've got at least a year's worth of wiggle room of cash,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   and then I would just take distributions from my taxable account based upon looking at the market.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   If I'm looking at the market and I say things are feeling relatively high,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I would go ahead and pull some money to the side off the market.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   If things weren't, then I would go ahead and leave that,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   and I would balance it based upon my earned income.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   The technical answer, and I'm going to go into, as soon as I can,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   I'm going to get out some retirement planning shows.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   The problem is that most of the research is built around age 65 retirees,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   and even most of that research assumes some base level of income.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   There's not a ton of formal academic research from somebody saying,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   "I've got $2 million in my Vanguard total stock market index fund,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   and I'm just going to do a few percent distribution off of it."
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   It probably should work.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   The research indicates that it should work,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   because when the portfolios are stress-tested, they last for longer than 30 years.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   But in terms of actually you yourself, I would take a more flexible approach,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   recognizing I'm going to make some money, I'm going to spend some dividends,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   I've got various asset classes that I'm going to be spending.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   I don't know if I answered the question or if I just talked around it.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Was that helpful at all?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   No, that was very helpful.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Specifically, I think what you triggered on there is that I need to look into
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   what my income plan will be.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   That's not a term I had really formalized, but that's exactly what I need to do.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Specifically, I didn't want to, let's say, like I said, magically tomorrow I hit that number,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   and I turn around and say, "Okay, that's the number I hit.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Let me go ahead and start taking distribution in whatever way I could
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   from whichever accounts that I have," and then find out that, "Oh, my God,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   half of my accounts, which are locked up in IRA, qualified accounts,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   are not accessible at all without major penalties."
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   So really I think the devil's in his eagle's there.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   I need to look into each of those accounts I have and start asking questions of each account,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   what are the rules surrounding this rather than it just being some amorphous blob
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   that gets piled into one big lump to say, "Is that the number or not?"
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   I need to understand each of those piles individually and what the rules are
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   surrounding them, and I don't understand that at this point.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   It's just like a target number without any rules for distribution known to me right now
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   because I'm ignorant of that right now.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So I think that's what I need to concentrate on if I want to feel more comfortable about that.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   But, yeah, it's always good to have that reminder of, like, I'm conservative,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   so I want to have that basis taken care of.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   I'm flexible, of course, but I want that lower floor to be taken care of,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   whether it's through real estate or through my other dividends that I can take
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   or whatever the mechanism I have to change to make a good dividend base happen.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   But, yeah, it's always good to get the reminders that I don't have to wait for the
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   absolute number because, I mean, as I've told you before, I do have a sneaky suspicion
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   that if I were to quit tomorrow and find more fulfilling work, I might even bring in
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   more money than I do now.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Maybe not.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Maybe I would bring in $0, but I just don't know.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   I always have that in the back of my mind and think of doing it earlier,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   and then reality sets in and two kids set in, and I think, "Well, I'll just stay with the job
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   that's very secure."
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Right.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And it's so hard.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   I hate being wishy-washy on answers, but the reality is it's got to be such a personal decision.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   The message that I feel is not prevalent is the message that I say,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   "Recognize the fact that you're probably never going to retire."
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Some people retire if they work a career or a job, and then they retire and move into
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   kind of the golden years.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Some people do it, but not many.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   And recognize that especially people who are financially independent,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   many of them are not going to want to do that.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   So recognize that you don't have to wait to have the number hit based upon your 4%
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   or 3% withdrawal rate.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Recognize that for the 23-year-old person, $50,000 in cash gives you the money to leave the job
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   that you hate, fly across the country, join the organization that you would volunteer your time
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   with for free if you weren't.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   So we can be very personal, and each of us can lay out a plan that's exactly appropriate to us.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   So I will try to do -- there's not a good -- there's not good content out there for people
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   who are planning financially independence as far as their actual distribution plan.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I'll put a note on my show idea and try to use an example of how it could be done.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Where you're going to spend your taxable accounts.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I'll try to think about -- see if I can create a compelling show on the topic to give some more
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   technical answers.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   But there are dozens of solutions.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   You could take the taxable account, put -- keep enough money on the side to get your business going,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   figure out what your floor is.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   If you retire at 40, buy yourself a 20-year annuity with a lump sum which gives you a floor of
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   income for 20 years, leave all the money in the retirement accounts growing at stock plans.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   It's got to be -- that's where you need your financial advisor.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   You've got to go through those projections with somebody who can go through what's the budget,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   what's the top range, what's the bottom range, what are your assets, what are your plans, et
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   cetera.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   I hope one of those guys you emailed me about, continue to give me feedback.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   I hope one of those guys works out for you.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   >> All right.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I will do.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Thanks again.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I'll let someone else ask a question.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Just with talking with the financial advisors, hopefully I find the right one at some point.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   You talk about early retirement a lot of times.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   When you combine they're not experienced with early retirement and I'm not -- don't have the
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   vocabulary to describe what I need, it becomes a very confusing conversation pretty quickly.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   I appreciate the tools.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   I'll keep you posted on how it goes.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   We're actually on our way very shortly to meet with one of the people from the Paladin registry
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   right now.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I'll keep you in the loop.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   >> For sure.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Who else?
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   Who has a question?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   >> Hey, Joshua.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   >> Rick.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   >> Go ahead, Rick.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   >> A quick question for you and I apologize if you've already answered this because I did come on
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   late.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   And that is I noticed in your signature that you are providing a 30 or 60 minute consultation on a
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   fully written financial plan.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Is that current?
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Is that something you're doing now?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   >> Yes, I'm in the process of launching that this week.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   And I've worked out the details on that.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   So, yes, I am willing to provide and I should advertise it.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I will provide a 30 to 60 minute free no obligation complimentary consultation with anybody who
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   might be interested in coaching just to check about and talk about personal private details.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   And the best way to do it is to if you're interested in that, the best thing to do is you can email
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   me or sometimes email goes to spam.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   If you're interested in coaching, just text me.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   My cell phone number is 561-386-6034.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Again, 561-386-6034.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   And you can just text me your name and your time zone and we can find a time that works well for
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   that.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   And I'll just describe a little bit of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   So long term with radical personal finance, I do not want to do -- I do not want to be an
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   individual financial advisor.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   I walked away from that business because there are lots of people who can do that really well.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   And I'm hoping to find more of them to build a network.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   But I'm not -- I don't want to be an individual financial advisor.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   So coaching is not advice.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   But there are still -- there's a massive need for people who can actually provide big picture
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   personalized wealth coaching, wealth creation coaching.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   And that's what's missing in the financial advice space.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Most financial advice is oriented around you've got a lot of money, let me tell you what to do
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   with your money.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   And very little is oriented around you're broke, let me tell you how to get money.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Now there are some people that are starting it.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   That's why I've tried to support XY Planning Network.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   They're doing a good job there.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   And I'll try to support and promote anybody else who's doing it.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   But there's tons of books out there on it.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   And there's not a lot of great information for helping people think it through.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   So I'm bringing on a limited number of clients.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   I haven't set the total number.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   But I think I'm probably going to cap it at 10 right now.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And I'm going to be working over the next two months with 10 individual clients for
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   individualized wealth creation coaching.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   And it's not going to be cheap, but it's also not going to be out of sight.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   At the moment, the packages -- and I've got to publish the page.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   I'm working on the page to actually formalize this.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   But at the moment, the packages are from $1,500 to $4,500.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And these are limited-time engagements with a certain number of phone consultations,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   email consultations, things like that, with a lot of homework in between.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And what I'm doing with that coaching program is, number one, I'm trying to provide it
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   as a service to help some people get some more personalized plans and approaches.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   It also helps me because it's immediate income as I continue to build the income
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   base behind Radical Personal Finance.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   And I'm using that data with the curriculum that I've developed that I'm going to be
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   walking coaching clients through.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I'm using it to test it with individual people, get feedback before I publish the
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   comprehensive self-help resources, before I publish the book, before I publish the
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   curriculum, before I publish the seminars, the audio products, those types of things.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And so I've got the curriculum designed, and I'm testing it with the up-front
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   coaching clients.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And then I'm building it out for where I can develop products and sell those
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   products into the general marketplace.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   So that is new.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I just added it to the signature, to my email signature in the last couple of days.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   I haven't -- I've mentioned it on the show here and there, but I'm right now working
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   on publishing the page with my web designer on a different website, publishing the
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   coaching page and putting the information out.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   The difference between coaching and financial advice and financial planning,
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   number one, I have not established an RIA, a Registered Investment Advisory Firm,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   so I will not be giving any specific advice on sell the security, buy that security.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   I can give overall generalized input, but I won't be -- I don't sell any products.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   I'm not selling any -- no insurance policies, no investment products, anything like
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   that.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   And I'm not going to be doing -- I'm not going to be delivering a financial plan
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   with a specific projections of financial planning software, 132-page report of
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   here are the projections.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I'll do them by hand and give some big-picture advice.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   And frankly, clients don't read the 130-page either.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   I've only had about -- in the time that I was doing financial advice and delivering
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   130-page reports, I probably had five clients who actually would go through page
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   by page, and those were wonderful clients.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   And there's one former client who's actually on this call, and you know who you are.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   That's familiar.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Susan Harris.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   I wanted you to say your name, but go ahead.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Susan is actually a former client of mine who started listening to the show after I
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   left the financial advice business.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   And Susan, you were one of about five clients out of over 1,000 people who actually
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   went page by page through the financial plan and understood each and every page.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   So at this point, my intention is to do financial plans on one page and give people
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   a clear rail to run on for a wealth plan, not just, okay, here's the standard
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   application of your portfolio, because in the scope of life, that stuff's meaningless
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   to people.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   So that's the answer, Trick.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Does that answer the question?
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yeah, that definitely helps.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   And with that said, maybe a follow-up to that would be, you've mentioned before
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   financial advisor, podcast, or coaching as well.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Is that also in the pipeline, or are you putting that on the back burner at this
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   point?
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   It's in the pipeline.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   So here's the problem I face in the business.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   And as with anything, I'm working my way through the entrepreneurial process.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   And right now, I'm in the teenage stage of a business, the rough adolescence, as
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Michael Griver would call it, the difficult adolescence, where at the beginning, I've
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   gone through a personal transformation.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   When I started Radical Personal Finance, I was just tired.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I was tired of employees.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   I was tired of assistants.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   I was tired, and I was just kind of tired.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   So my vision at that time was I just wanted to do me and my microphone and sit in the
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   back of my RV and record my dinky little podcast and publish it and just do that.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   So it took about four, five, six months for me to kind of decompress and realize, well,
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   I could do that, but I think I need to build something bigger, and to realize, to prove
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   out that, yes, the demand for good information and good advice is out there.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   And yes, I am willing to go ahead and build the actual business.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   So after that point in time, I started working on the infrastructure, hiring the right people,
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   hiring the web developer instead of me dealing with it, hiring a designer instead of me dealing
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   with it.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   Next month, I'm hiring the audio editor instead of me doing it.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   So that frees up time.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   And then also, once I dropped my consulting contract, that opened up more time for me
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   as well.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   And so at this point, I'm building the larger business of Radical Personal Finance.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   And so it's taken time for me to build out the capacity to be able to handle the coaching,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   to be able to handle this.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   The Financial Advisor podcast is a market that I believe exists with regard to the info
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   products.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   But when it comes down to actually serving the Financial Advisor marketplace, I thought
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   I could do it, but I realized I'm just not that excited about it.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   So I'm not excited about creating a once a week Financial Advisor-focused podcast.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   There's lots of Financial Advisors that listen to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   And so in essence, I just decided I'm not as excited about that as I am excited about
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   other things.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I've still got the Simple website up.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   I've got a few people that have signed up on the email list of interest.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   And as I outsource, I'm writing the Radical Personal Finance book right now.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   I'm going to build out from that a series of talks that are going to come from that,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   a series of self-coaching products, a series of seminars.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   As I build that out, then I'll continue to do that.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   What I've realized, though, is I've had a number of people who are Financial Advisors
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   who've reached out to me for kind of some coaching on the actual media side.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   And so I probably should do like a special one-time conference call or something for
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   some of you guys who are from that perspective and just share what I've learned to try to
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   help because this is absolutely the future.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Doing your own media and creating good access to people for Financial Advisors is absolutely,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   I'm convinced, is the future for any type of service business.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   And that's what we need to be doing now.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   Not trying to do what I'm doing as far as this crazy lots of content, all the focus,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   but just communicating with clients in a very focused, specialized way.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   So it's on the back burner right now because there are bigger opportunities in front of
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   me, but I do intend at some point to get around to it.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Okay, great.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   And as an aside, if you're ever curious, I set up my full proprietor RIA in 2010.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   So if you ever wanted to find out what that was like, if you ever do consider that path,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   let me know and I'll be happy to share my experience.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Yeah, for sure, man.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I think it's awesome that you had done it.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   I had gone through and I wrote the, I went through all the process and then just the
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   last minute I pulled the papers from it.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   And by the way, I do have still here on, I got, what's his name, the book, the Boston,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   here's the Boston Economics guy, Kotlikoff.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   I bought his book and I've got it.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   I've still got your question of your review of it.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   So at some point I may review the book for you.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Yeah, that was an old question.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   I didn't think, I thought that one had fallen by the wayside by now.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   So cool.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   I'm glad you got the book.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   I think you'll really enjoy his perspective being a little different than the mainstream.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   I do like, I always, I quote his numbers on unfunded liabilities.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   He is at the high end, but I've never seen, you know, with 200 and what's the up to
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   220, $230 trillion of unfunded liabilities in a total government debt, inclusive of
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   unfunded liabilities that we face.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I've never seen a credible, I haven't seen an article that credibly discounts his numbers.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Most of the estimates are in the hundred trillion dollar numbers, but I just always use his
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   $220 trillion number myself until I find someone that can discredit him.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   But he's done good work.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   So a little leftist in my face, but whatever.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   He's done a lot of good work in social security strategies as well.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   I'm pretty familiar with all his work on that.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   And he has a new book on that as well.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   That just came out.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Yep.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Yep.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   I've seen that.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   So awesome.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   So yeah, if I can help Rick, let me know.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Who's next?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Hey Josh, I just wanted to make a quick point.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   A little while back you were asking if anybody would be willing to volunteer for, to help
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   you with anything.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   So I responded, but I don't know whether you get some of my stuff, but if there's
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   anything I can help you with, let me know.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   It would only be maybe a couple hours a week or something.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   So, you know, take it for what it's worth or whatever, but you can always contact me
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   to see if it's something I could help you with.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   I have to check this fan folder, Susan.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   I haven't gotten, I didn't get that email from you.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   I have gotten emails from other, from some other listeners and the challenge, and thank
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   you very much for being willing to do that.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   The biggest challenge for me has been figuring out what and how to outsource and how to actually
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   do that, designing the business.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   And that was where when I didn't, I didn't design radical personal finance right from
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   the beginning because I designed it as just kind of, I just wanted to sit down with me
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   and my microphone.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   I intentionally didn't plan out the scale of the business and how to do that.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   At this point in time, I have gone forward and kind of planned some of those things out,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   but I'm still finding challenge of how to, how to outsource tasks.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And so it's been a challenge, but thank you.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   I will keep that in mind.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   Yep, sure.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   Hello.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   This is Mike.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Hey, Mike, go for it.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   Hey.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   So this is a little, I mean, this is talking about long-term planning, but we're considering
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   long-term care insurance.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   And I was wondering what your opinion was on that.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   I've read conflicting things.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   So I'll give you the big picture scenario and then you can, you might need to give me
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   more specifics, but let me give you the big picture answer.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Long-term care insurance is unaffordable for anybody with less than maybe say three to
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   $500,000 of assets.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   It's very important for people with say $300,000 to a couple million dollars of assets.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   And it's not strictly necessary for people who are going to have more than a couple million
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   bucks at retirement, but it can be a really good buy as a hedge against the potential
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   risk.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   The challenge is that the marketplace has changed dramatically over the last two to
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   three years.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   And the policies were in the past much more generous than they are now.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And you've got to buy it at the right time in your life to be able to afford the premiums.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   And so big picture, there's nothing wrong with the product.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   It needs to be carefully bought and it needs to fit properly into the comprehensive plan.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   I actually own long-term care insurance.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   What happened when I was in it for me and for my wife, even at my age, because when
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   I was with Northwestern Mutual, it used to be you could buy big, big policies with unlimited
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   benefits.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   And then systematically some of the companies systematically started pulling back on benefits.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   And so Northwestern Mutual was one of the last three companies to offer long-term care
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   policies with a lifetime benefit period.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   And I actually bought insurance for me and for my wife at that time because I could still
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   get the unlimited benefits.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   And it's really a useful product from a tax perspective.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   It's got a unique niche.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   And if you have the right type of corporate setup, you can fully deduct the premiums and
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   get the benefits tax-free, which is unique.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   So that's my big picture answer.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   You want to give me more specifics and ask me about your situation?
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   I'll try to give you more commentary.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Well, I mean, my wife and I are in our low to mid-30s, so we're not old.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   But my wife has some Alzheimer's in her family history.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   So we're just trying to protect our assets moving forward in case something happens.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Are you fully on track for traditional retirement where you could expect to be well-funded for
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   retirement at the age of, say, 60, 65, that type of traditional retirement age?
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Absolutely.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   But the plan is for us to have a kid in the next couple of years.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   And we have enough in the savings to where we could just live off of her salary.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   So that's sort of the plan right now.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   What type of work do you do?
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   I'm a software engineer.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   Do you have disability income insurance?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Yes.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Okay.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   So you want to maximize your disability income insurance before you get to long-term care
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   insurance.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   You're in one of those areas where it's hard, without going through a ton of details,
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   it's tough to -- it's tough for me to give you an answer.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   You're in the difficult space.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   In general, here's my approach to long-term care.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   The advice that you get out there in the marketplace is usually advice that says, "Wait until,"
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   for example, Dave Ramsey or Suzy Orman always said, "Wait until you're 60."
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   And so there are a lot of people who will parrot that advice to get into web forums
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   and things like that.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   I've never been able to figure out any rational reason to wait for a certain age to buy long-term
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   care insurance.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And the challenge is when you're 60, it gets so expensive when you get into the 60s that
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   many people find it difficult to stomach actually spending the money on the premiums.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   So that's a real challenge when you get to be that age.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   So I've never been able to prove to myself that waiting until a certain age was a good
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   idea.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   I'm open to somebody who could convince me of it, but I've never been able to prove it.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   What I have --
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   Go ahead.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   I was going to say the only caveat to that is I've read -- I don't know if it's true
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   or not -- that you can go ahead and buy it when you're younger, but then there's so much
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   instability in that space.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Like you were saying, that things could change and you could just lose everything that you
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   had put into it if they totally changed the rules.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   Right.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   So let me address that in just a second because that is a concern, but that's overblown, in
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   my opinion.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   I'll talk to you about the state of the market.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Let me just make a note.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   So I can make sure to come back to that.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   So how I've approached the buying decision is let's talk in order of risk.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   So for somebody like you guys, okay, we're young, we're doing well financially, we're
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   saving for gold, and what we're thinking about risk is to think, "Is this a risk that we
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   face that we're concerned about?"
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   And so the answer is yes, we're concerned that my wife might have Alzheimer's disease,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   and so therefore we want to protect against that.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   That's not, however, a high priority risk.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   So you want to start with making sure that you're on track for all the rest of your plans.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   That's why I ask about retirement.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   And so how I approach it is to say, I would ask you if I were doing individual planning
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   for you, Mike, I would say, "Are you on track for traditional retirement?"
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Yes.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   "Do you have life insurance and disability insurance, which are much higher probabilities
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   and likelihoods than long-term care needs?"
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   If so, yes.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   Okay, do we have additional money that we could, do we want to hedge against this risk
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   with additional money, and is this thing to make sense in our overall portfolio?
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   And if you, you know, we make plenty of money, we're saving well, we are not sacrificing
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   our lifestyle, you know, at this point, let's see, my long-term care premiums for my wife
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   and for me are what, 60 bucks a month?
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Yeah, about 60 bucks a month.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   I've got a, I've got a Cadillac policy with pretty decent benefits, with a pretty decent
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   benefit amount, so it's got all kinds of fancy inflation options.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   So 60 bucks a month is not going to materially impact, you know, it's not going to make a
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   huge difference whether I buy it or not.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   And I like having the confidence of it being there.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   So that's how I would approach it at your age.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   As long as you're on track for other things, then yes, you can check it out.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   State of the market.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Here's what's challenging.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   When you get into the state of the market, and this was why I went ahead and bought when
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   the unlimited benefit period was available.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   If I developed early onset Alzheimer's or I had a car accident that caused me to need
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   ongoing care, my policy would never run out of money.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   And so at 30, that's a really compelling scenario because I've got a, I've got a dramatic potential
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   benefit for a very small cost.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   And those policies, to the best of my knowledge, nobody is offering unlimited benefit periods
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   anymore.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   New York Life was the last one to pull their product and they pulled it back in about 2012,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   2013.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   I could be wrong.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Somebody could have offered it, but I haven't heard of it, of anybody still offering it.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   So now how you price a policy is you build the policy in based upon an amount of money
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   and you say, what's the total benefit value that I'm going to try to plan for?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   So you might plan for a policy that has a total of $500,000 of benefits in the contract.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   And so it's a little bit more challenging now because you don't have that unlimited
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   option to figure out what's the right fit from the contract perspective.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   There were a lot of companies that jumped into the long-term care insurance marketplace
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   that thought they were going to make a killing and they thought they were going to make a
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   killing.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   And the insurance industry priced insurance policies originally based upon some assumptions
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   from disability insurance, certain lapse ratios and things like that.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   They priced that into the products and the majority of companies dramatically underpriced
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   their products.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   And since that time, there was a huge amount of turmoil in the marketplace where there
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   was a huge amount of turmoil in the marketplace and many companies lost money.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   They stopped selling the products.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   They increased premiums across the board, et cetera.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   You cannot buy, again, to the best of my knowledge, you cannot buy a contract that is using insurance
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   lingo called non-cancelable.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   Non-cancelable means that the insurance company doesn't have the rights to raise your premiums.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   All insurance companies have the right to change premiums on enforced long-term care
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   insurance policies if they want to.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   So you can't buy a policy, even my policy, Northwestern Mutual has the right to raise
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   the rates on me if they need to, not as an individual but as a class of insureds.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   So they can raise it on all males between the age of 30 and 45 that fit this demographic.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   They can do that.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   So in long-term care, this was a little bit of a holdover from my selling days when I
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   was selling for Northwestern Mutual, but I still believe it to be true.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   Company matters.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   And I would not shop based upon price.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   I would shop based upon company.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   So there I would recommend you start with some of the big mutuals.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   Start with Northwestern Mutual, New York Life.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   Check out their products.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   Let's see, who are the other?
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   Lincoln is a big player in the long-term care marketplace.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   They have a lot of business.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   Start with them, but look for stability of company.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   I think that matters.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   What happens when the company stops selling the product or they get rid of it, what they'll
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   do is they will at time write off the business.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   They set up a trust fund and then they take the policies and they move them over into
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   the trust fund.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   And they fund it and then that trust fund is accountable to pay off claims that are
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   going to come out of that pool.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   So if it's poorly managed, then what can happen is the trust fund can become toxic
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   and people bail.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   The healthy people that can get new insurance, they bail and they go on their way.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   And then the fund falls apart because that's continually increased premiums and the only
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   people that keep the policies are the ones who are sick.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   So that can happen if a company is poorly managed and that has happened.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   So in long-term care, a long-term care policy is a very different thing than a 10-year
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   level term life policy.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   I would go with one of the quality companies that are going to have a longer-term focus
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   on the business versus just whoever's cheapest.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   Okay, great.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   Thank you.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   Yeah, hopefully that helps.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   In your situation, I would say it's probably a toss-up.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   If you – what I like about long-term care, I can run it through the business, fully
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   deductible.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   That saves me a little bit of money.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   And then the benefit on the back end is tax-free.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   So plus when you're young, it's so cheap.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   If Northwestern Mutual canceled the policy, I'm out, what, $600 to $700 a year for a
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   few years.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   And if I decided to walk from it, it's not that big a deal.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   It's cheap enough when you're in your 30s that as long as you're on track for retirement,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   as long as you've got life insurance, disability insurance, and you're funding other short-term
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   goals as well, then toss it in.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   You're probably not going to miss $60 a month.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   All right.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   Excellent.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Thank you so much.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   Who else?
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   Joshua, I know you're over your hour's time, so you don't have to answer this right
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   now if you don't want to.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   But I took your advice a while back when we got together, and I sold my house up north
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   because I wasn't really making a killing.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   Awesome.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   So now I don't know what to do with it.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   By the time I dish out some money here and there and stuff, I'll probably have like
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   $100K that I'm not really quite sure what to do on that, even thinking maybe annuity.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   I don't know.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   So think about it.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   You don't have to answer it right now.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   I know other people might have questions.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   I set aside on my schedule two hours, so I wanted to take as many questions as I could
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   for up to two hours.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   Good.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   So I'll answer.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   I'll give you just a quick thing.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   Did you ever connect with the person who took over your accounts when I left Northwestern
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   Mutual?
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   No.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   They've been calling, but I haven't.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   Okay.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   At least meet with them and just talk to them and just see.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   I think the person who should be calling would be the Marks office, or it might be somebody
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   else, but it's probably Marks office.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   So set up a thing there and they can help you by going into the numbers, rerunning a
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   financial plan and talking about it and talking about details of it and in your situation
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   because it needs to fit into the overall plan.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   I would say don't worry about just keeping it in cash right now.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Just be happy you have the cash sitting aside and you're not going to spend it.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   Just set it aside and think about it in a longer term basis.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   You need to again find another advisor who can work with you on details.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Consider also reaching out to the person who is advising you on your 401(k) plan and see
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   if they can help you out.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   Okay.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   All right.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   Yep.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   That's it for me.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   Thank you.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   This is great.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   No worries.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   Who else?
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   I've got time.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   Anyone else want to ask questions?
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   Joshua, this is Mark again.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   Go ahead.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   I don't know if anybody else had a question that hasn't asked anything yet, but nobody
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   was saying anything.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   I thought I'd jump in.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   You don't have to go into too much detail on this just because I actually have to drop
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   off here in about 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   Some of your recent podcasts have inspired my wife and I to take a look at maybe some
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   side income businesses, either franchise or some web business or something like that.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   We've never done anything like that before.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   We're both employed right now, and that's all we've ever done.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   I don't know if you have a couple of quick hit type considerations, things that we should
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   think about as we start to think about not necessarily a specific type of business in
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   that, but just considerations from moving from just solely earning W-2 income to starting
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   a business and what kinds of things we would need to think about.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   I know there's tech implications and some other things, but it's a pretty broad question.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   I don't know if you have a way to answer that.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   It's an interesting question.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   I'll just give you some big hits.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Just kind of my general business advice.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Number one, go slow.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   You have no reason to move fast if you have a good situation.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   There's no reason to try to jump into something quickly when you can just simply focus on
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   – by the way, I'm sorry.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   Right when I was answering, I got distracted by the question in the chat that Jonathan
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   asked.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   Jonathan, I'll ask the question on the phone here in a minute.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Jonathan's asking for some questions in the chat to find out who's also in the California
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   area.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   Check that out in the chat if you're on a computer, which he is.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   Sorry, I apologize for getting distracted, but I realized I wanted to answer those questions
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   people are listening on a computer.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   In general, start slow and do explore something for fun and look for opportunity.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   Don't worry about any of the stuff that people get concerned about.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   You don't need to worry about entity selection.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   You don't need to worry about tax implications.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   All that stuff is actually really simple.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   It's not hard to do, and it's really not a big deal to start a business.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   The key to starting a business is just simply getting a customer.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   As soon as you can get your first customer, you're in business.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   Look around and look for opportunity or look for need.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   Try to do it based upon an understanding of your personality, based upon an understanding
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   of your goals, based upon an understanding of what you're actually trying to accomplish.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   If you start with that, then explore things.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   The business can be as simple as, I don't know, one of these things you see, the guy
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   is going out.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   There was a TV show I saw one time, it was something like Dirty Jobs, but it's different,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   where people are out hunting truffles in the woods and making decent money.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   People up in Alabama are hunting truffles in the woods and selling them and making money
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   on that.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   I've got a friend of mine who's a commercial fisherman.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   For him, his perfect business is going out and fishing every day because he loves it.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   For me, that's exactly the opposite.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   You don't have to be limited to the online world, the online stuff.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   For me, I don't want to go out on the boat every day, but for him, he loves it.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Find the customer first and then let the customer create the business.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   The mistake that most entrepreneurs do is they spend too much time planning, then they
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   buy a bunch of stuff before they have customers.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   They're out saying, "Well, I've got to set up an LLC and I've got to go and do this and
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   buy business cards," and things like that.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   What they really should just simply do is go and see if they can sell some services.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   If you do that, then you'll be focused on where you get feedback from the marketplace.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   The next thing is look at what your actual benefits and advantages are that other people
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   might not have.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   If you're trying to start a business and you don't want to invest any money in it, then
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   what is your knowledge and expertise that you can apply that other people don't have?
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   That's what radical personal finance was.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   It cost me very little to start it, but I looked at the marketplace and I said, "I have
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   knowledge, expertise, and ability that many people don't have."
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   Many people would struggle to do what I do as far as creating this type of content.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   I don't struggle.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   It comes naturally to me.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   On the other hand, if you've got half a million dollars and you're trying to figure out, "I've
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   got half a million dollars," recognize that's a huge advantage and let the marketplace screen
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   out all the competition of people who don't have half a million dollars to invest.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   You go and figure out where you can compete in a way that they don't have.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   In general, a good book to read on it, I would recommend Michael Masterson wrote a book called
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   "Ready, Fire, Aim."
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   I thought he did a good job in that book of laying out the process of business and walking
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   through the different stages.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   The second thing as far as education, read Michael Gerber's book, "The E-Myth," stands
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   for "The Entrepreneur Myth," and design your business intentionally, recognizing that the
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   job of a business is to create a product or service that the marketplace desires and wants
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   and create profit for you, the owner, and that profit has to be substantial enough for
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   you to want to continue in business.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   Design your business intentionally, and that's the best general advice I could give you.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   Quick question here, Jonathan asked in the chat, and I didn't advertise this, but you
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   could actually listen to this call on the computer and not just on the phone.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   Jonathan asked in the chat who also is from the California area.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   Rick, was that you who's from near Reading, California?
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   All right.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   Well, hey, this is Evan.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   I'm actually in California as well, but I'm in the Orange County, California area.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   Okay.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   All right.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   So, Evan, shoot me an email later.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   There's another listener who lives near you, and we're just asking in the chat to connect,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   and I'll just connect you.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   If you guys want to be connected, I'll connect you guys, and you can see if you can form
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   some kind of in-person relationship, which would be cool.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   That was just the question I wanted to respond to.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   Yeah, sounds great.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   Did that help with the question about business?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   Did that help at all?
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   Yeah, very much.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   Okay.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Anybody else want to ask a question?
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   I have another half hour or we can end it.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   I don't want to belabor it, but I'd be happy to answer any questions that you guys want.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   Hey, no, should I start?
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   Go ahead.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   Go ahead.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   No, no, no.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   Yeah, throw another.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   All right.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   All right.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   Hold on.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   Hold on.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   412 area code.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   Go.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   All right.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   Sorry.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   Hey, this is Nick again.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   I can't stick around for the answer, unfortunately, but I'll listen to the recording wherever you
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   make it available if you want to answer this question, but I'm hopping in to see that financial
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   advisor right now.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   But one question I kind of was curious to have your take on is day to day I find it
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   more and more difficult to, I guess, balance just the organization of living life and being
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   able to systemize things that need to be systemized and living organized and feeling like you're
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   struggling with the chaoticness of trying to start a side business, whatever that may
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   be.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   I have three or four things going on right now, which is one of my problems.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   I lack focus.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.800]   But if you had to pick one thing, which is between the two of getting your life organized
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:23.800]   first where you feel stable enough to go forward with a venture or just doing the venture first
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.160]   and the other stuff will just fall by the wayside if it's less important.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160]   What's your take on that?
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.640]   Because I always struggle with that.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.960]   Should I get my life more organized or should I be really hammering down and focusing on
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.160]   these on, you know, pick up side venture and focus on it?
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.880]   I'd just be curious to hear your answer on that.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.920]   But I do have to run in to meet the advisor now.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   So thank you for that.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.920]   And bye to everybody.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.920]   For sure.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.120]   I'll go ahead and answer it and I'll post the recording for you.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.680]   So it's an interesting question.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:02.200]   My answer to it is that I think the idea of getting your life organized for most of us
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.440]   who would be on a call like this is it's absurd.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.320]   We're never going to, it's never going to happen.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.880]   And the reason I say that is because I used to stress out about getting everything done
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.280]   and well, someday I'm going to get everything done.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.880]   Someday I'm going to get it on top of things.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.200]   And then I realized that any time that I started to get on top of things, I would just add
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.400]   more things on top of the list.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:34.400]   And that for people who are, I'm not sure what the right word is, but I guess I would
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.560]   say for people who are big picture thinkers, who are courageous, who are success oriented,
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.420]   we're never going to finish everything because as soon as you get to the end of your list,
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.160]   you're immediately looking for the next thing to do.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.600]   You've already added four more ideas.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.200]   And so the type of person who is going to accumulate money, the type of person who's
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.520]   going to start a business, not the type of person who's just going to sit around and
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.920]   who's going to sit around and have everything done.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.240]   So the way that I've come to handle it, maybe you disagree, maybe you agree.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.240]   I don't know.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.680]   I've come to just simply walk away from the expectation that I'm ever going to get on
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.800]   top of everything, that I'm ever going to be organized, that any of those things are
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:19.720]   ever going to happen completely and focus first on saying, what are the things that
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.960]   I want to get done and what are the things that must get done?
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.360]   And instead of focusing on having everything under control, just simply focus on doing
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.480]   the highest priority things.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.480]   And for me, what I find is that if I focus on doing the highest priority things and let
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.840]   other things suffer, there's never enough time to do everything and there's always enough
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.980]   time to do the most important things.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:49.560]   So if I know what my priorities are and I put hard deadlines around those, then I'll
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.400]   be able to move forward.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.880]   So what happens is, give you some examples from my life.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:01.520]   I know that, for example, one of my highest priorities and values is time with my family.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.680]   So I know that when it's time for breakfast or when it's time for dinner or when it's
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:09.440]   time for lunch, I generally don't work through breakfast or dinner or lunch unless I'm out
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.440]   of town.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.920]   And so whether I'm done for the day or not, I'm quitting and I'm going to go and spend
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.920]   time with my family.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:21.520]   And that allows me to make sure that my highest priority things are done.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.160]   And if I don't get the show out, I don't get the show out.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.280]   If I don't get the email sent back, I don't get the email sent back.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:32.280]   Then also in the morning, what I try to do is just spend time first focusing on what
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.520]   is the most important thing.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:40.480]   And what I find is I have to maintain two different, I guess, productivity systems.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.560]   I have to maintain the productivity system that's based on my goals.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.040]   And by productivity system, I just mean a list, whether it's a list in a notebook or
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.320]   I use a couple of different apps.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.480]   I use an app called Goals on Track.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.320]   I use an app from time to time called Nozbe.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.480]   I almost need to maintain two different things, one that's based upon goals and the other
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.520]   that's based upon everything else.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.680]   And so first I want to start by focusing on my goals.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.520]   If my goals say I want to get stronger, then I need to get to the gym.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.280]   If my goals say I need to get my business started and I need to get that done and push
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:17.400]   everything else back, in that way I'm at least getting the things that are most important
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   to me.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.040]   And then just scheduling time from time to time to review those priorities and doing
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.040]   that.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.360]   I think it's a hopeless type dream to have the idea of ever getting organized.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.760]   I don't know any successful entrepreneur, any person who's made a big splash and a big
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:34.440]   impact who's fully on top of everything.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.360]   It's always a little bit chaotic.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.120]   And I think one of the aspects of being successful in business is learning to be okay with a
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:45.520]   little bit of chaos, but also having the systems to make sure the most important things get
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.520]   done.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.520]   So that's my answer.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.520]   Hopefully that's helpful.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.080]   Evan, I think you were fighting with Nick.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.080]   Go ahead.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:59.640]   Yeah, I just wanted to kind of piggyback on the side business and goals and focusing question.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:04.760]   For someone who knows that they want to do something on the side and maybe the situation
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.960]   is a little bit more urgent, maybe it's not, but can't decide on what that thing is, do
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.840]   you have any recommendations for how to work through that process and actually thinking
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:19.560]   what you might be good at doing and what you actually want to do on the side versus just
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.320]   wanting to make extra money?
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:28.240]   Well, if you have any idea whatsoever, go do it and see what the marketplace says.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.720]   Because what happens is as you start to move and you start to take action, all of a sudden
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.200]   opportunities come your way.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.400]   And in the last, I've been doing radical personal finance a year and a half now, and in the
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:47.440]   last year and a half, I have had more business opportunities come across my desk than I can
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:53.320]   count and more connections and more relationships and more opportunities and more paths that
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   I could pursue.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.000]   I've got product ideas left and right.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.400]   I've got business ideas left and right.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.480]   But if I had just simply sat around and thought and thought and thought and thought, then
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.120]   I wouldn't know what those things are.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.720]   So if you have any inkling of an idea, then I say go and start.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.080]   And this is so if I'm giving career advice, I give the same advice to people who are,
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:19.320]   you know, if I'm talking to a 15 year old, if you have that, I pity and I hate what we
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:27.520]   do to kids, where we force kids to spend the first basically 20 to 25 years of their life
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.280]   spending time on schooling, and they don't get any practical experience with different
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   things.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:39.000]   And so they spend the first 20 or 25 years of their life spending all this time sitting
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.240]   in class when the class is basically designed to prepare them for the next thing.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:49.960]   And they have zero, many people have very little practical experience in something that
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.640]   actually matters.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:59.920]   What happens is in if you if we quit that, or it's one of the best things that my dad
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:05.160]   ever did for me, was he worked and worked and worked to get me involved in all kinds
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.840]   of different jobs.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.560]   And looking back on it now, I never realized when I was younger, how hard that was for
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.560]   him.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.360]   It would have been a lot easier for him to just pay me an allowance and give me money
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:22.320]   to spend than it was for him to take me around and take me to all of my different jobs every
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.640]   day or, you know, every Saturday if it was during the school year or however it was.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.440]   It would have been a lot easier for him to just simply 20 bucks a week wouldn't have
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.560]   made a big difference in his life versus the cost of the time to get me to me and all my
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   siblings.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.400]   Remember, I'm the youngest of seven to get me and all my siblings to all of our jobs.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:48.640]   But the confidence that it gave me by going by by working all these different jobs and
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:54.200]   doing all these different things, I actually I know who I am better than most people my
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.080]   age and knowing who I am has come through doing all these different jobs.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:05.120]   So by doing all these different jobs, I've had the opportunity to I've had the opportunity
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.160]   to be exposed to different industries, different things.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.200]   And I've made notes mental and physical of the attributes of things that I like and that
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.480]   I don't like.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:21.080]   And so radical personal finance is a reflection not of just an idea that came out of the blue,
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:27.120]   but it's a reflection of a design that came to me when I was kneeling on the floor laying
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.840]   tile and grouting a tile floor with my back aching saying, "I don't want to do this
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   for a living."
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:39.120]   And it was coming from driving around in a car selling life insurance policies saying,
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.360]   "I don't want to drive around in the car all day.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.920]   I want to be able to sit at home and spend my time building."
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.920]   So from a kid perspective, that made a huge difference in my life and I'm so grateful
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   for that.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:58.360]   And I think that the best thing that we can do for kids is expose them as broadly as possible.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.360]   And then if they want to go deep in a subject, then let them go deep.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.560]   I hate, I love the fact that a lot of times a 14 year old or 15 year old young man or
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.240]   woman might be working.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.000]   But if you're just working as a cashier at the local grocery store, that's good.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.840]   It's better than doing nothing.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.360]   But it's not nearly as good as if you spend three months working as a bagger at a grocery
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.000]   store, three months on a construction crew, three months working on a farm, three months
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.480]   working in an office doing all these things because then you can start to see who am I.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.240]   So rant on kids over, what about us as adults?
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.600]   Well, the same thing applies to us as adults.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.800]   In general, most of us have had a vision held in front of us by our parents.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.520]   You know, you're going to go and be a doctor.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.980]   You're going to go and be a law student, an attorney.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:47.240]   You're going to go and do this or go and do that.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.880]   And we follow in this one course without getting feedback from the marketplace.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:58.040]   And so my answer to anybody who's interested in something is don't go and don't go and
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:02.620]   spend too much time really pursuing something until you've gotten into it.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:07.960]   Don't go and open a restaurant without going and first getting a job as a bar back carrying
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.640]   dishes to see if you like the restaurant environment.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.920]   You know, don't go to law school unless you've gone and worked as a paralegal or been an
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.160]   assistant to see if you like actually like the environment.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:25.080]   Go and get as much experience as fast and cheap as possible before you go and spend
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:31.600]   a lot of time and commit a lot of resources to something and then make the opportunity
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.400]   push its way back to you and say, yes, I really the opportunity that you should be following.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.960]   So build the flexibility in your life to try different jobs, try different industries.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:47.120]   And the same thing with businesses, try a bunch of businesses and see what you like
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.080]   and see what you don't like.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.400]   And you've got to.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.360]   That's why it comes back to sell, sell, sell, sell, sell as fast as you can.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.560]   Don't commit a lot of time and a little a lot of money to something until you're sure
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:05.680]   that you've that this is what you need to do and test the ideas as quickly, as cheaply
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:10.440]   as possible, recognizing that it's only one out of one idea out of 10 that's actually
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.120]   going to really probably pan out, maybe less, maybe more, maybe less, maybe two out of two
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   out of 10.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.280]   You know, back to the 20 percent deal.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.880]   But recognize that most ideas aren't going to pan out.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:29.160]   So the goal should be to get the idea to fail as quickly as possible and make the idea prove
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.320]   itself that it's really a good idea.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.480]   So that's how I approach it.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.920]   That's how I think about it.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:41.080]   And based upon all the entrepreneurs I know, based upon studying people who are successful,
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.280]   I find that to be a good strategy for many things in life.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   Great.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   Thank you.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.880]   That's that's very helpful.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.760]   Just trying it seems to be where I get hung up.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.360]   So I'll try to take that advice to heart.
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.360]   And trying it is going to mean something different for every industry and for every for every
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   industry.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.600]   So that's one example of trying it.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.880]   It could mean something as simple as, you know what, I don't know what I want to do
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:15.920]   with my life for the next, you know, once a week I'm going to call somebody that I know
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.440]   and admire and respect and I'm going to take them out for lunch and I'm going to ask them
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.200]   about their journey and just ask them a question that could allow people.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.280]   I've done that.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:31.440]   And that allows you to try occupations in ways that you never would have been able to.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.840]   You could say, what do you love about this?
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.200]   What do you hate about this?
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.820]   It could be as simple as that.
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.040]   It could be as simple as let me take a class.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:45.600]   Let me find out for Lynda.com or Coursera or go on YouTube and watch some videos and
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.600]   keep notes.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.840]   I try to keep a notebook and any time I'm interested in something, make a note of why
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.880]   am I interested in that and what is it that reflects like and ask yourself the question,
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.280]   what why does that appeal to me?
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.240]   And then by factoring that in, you know, when I was younger, I always wanted to be a truck
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   driver.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.400]   I know very clearly why that appeals to me.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.800]   I don't want to drive a truck every day.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.360]   But what I like is I like the ability to go here, go there, see different things every
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.360]   day.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.040]   And so for me, one of the things I didn't like about my financial advice practice is
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.880]   I needed to be in West Palm Beach, whereas what I like about Radical Personal Finance
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.480]   doesn't matter where I am.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.920]   So my desire to be a truck driver when I was a kid, I know why that appeals to me.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:29.720]   And now I can design that into my life now.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.720]   So take good notes on yourself.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:32.720]   Gotcha.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.720]   Will do.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:34.720]   Thank you.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:35.720]   All right.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.720]   Let's see.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:37.720]   Anyone else have a question?
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:38.720]   Hey, Joshua, this is Nicole.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   First off, thank you for all you're doing.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.200]   It's just fabulous.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:50.440]   And I'm always delighted to share with someone your podcast and connect them with you.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.640]   I am thinking about passive income streams.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:41:05.040]   I'm probably four years or so away from financial independence and outside of our Vanguard portfolio
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.320]   that will support that lifestyle down the road.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.640]   I'd love to have some additional revenue streams.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.400]   You talked about it a little bit, more stable ones.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.320]   When I think about passive income, I always hear real estate.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.520]   I hear, of course, your portfolio and the market, that sort of thing.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   It feels to me like there's probably some pseudo passive income opportunities out there.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.400]   You had one on that sounded like a little bit of a passive income stream with vending
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.400]   machines recently.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:40.840]   Are there others that come to mind that someone could, with just a little minimal effort,
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.840]   participate in in their later years when they're looking for passive income?
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.400]   It's a fun question.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.960]   Let me answer it in two different ways.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:56.440]   First, by talking about passive income and second, by talking about investing.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:03.520]   I personally do not believe that there is any source of actual passive income that exists
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.680]   except for dividends on large publicly traded companies.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.040]   That's the only form of passive income that I think is actually passive income.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.160]   If you can amass enough capital to buy shares of Coca-Cola Corporation and you can adjust
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:24.280]   your budget to live on the dividends from Coca-Cola Corporation, that is actually passive
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:27.400]   income or GE or whatever company you want to put together.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:35.200]   If you can put together a portfolio of large publicly traded companies that are well diversified
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.360]   and if you can live on the dividends, that's actually passive income.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:42.880]   It requires you to do nothing, absolutely nothing.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.600]   If enough dividend income is flowing into your account every quarter that gets you through
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:55.640]   that quarter with regard to your income, you are truly, absolutely 100% financially independent.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:03.000]   Now you don't have to get all the way to dividend income to be able to also have passive income.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:11.880]   So speaking simplistically, I'm going to do a show, the show after today's, the show,
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.920]   two shows from now is scheduled to be a show on annuities.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:22.080]   And so you could take a pile of money and you could annuitize it and that could be passive
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.320]   income where you're just receiving a lifetime annuity and whether that was because you won
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.620]   the lottery and you took the lifetime income option or because you took your million dollars,
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.800]   you turn it in for a life income annuity, that's passive income.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.520]   It just shows up every month and that could be expanded.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.280]   Maybe you have enough income from oil and gas ownership to pay you money, but that's
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.480]   passive income where you're not involved at all in the management.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.400]   You're not involved in anything except just spending the money.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.640]   If you were a trust fund kid and your, you know, your mom and dad left you 30 million
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.720]   bucks and with Northern Trust, Northern Trust will manage your passive income for you.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.160]   They'll put the, they'll put the money in your, in your account every single month.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.080]   That's passive income.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.200]   Everything short of that is not truly passive income.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.200]   It's closer to passive income, but it's not passive income.
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.960]   And so the question is how much involvement am I going to get into?
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.040]   So real estate, the way that it's commonly thought of something like buying single family
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:23.280]   houses, renting them out, that's not passive income.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.560]   That's a mix between investing and business.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.760]   You've got to do some kind of business work associated with that.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:33.560]   And you've got a, and it's a mix of investment and business.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:38.040]   The reason that's so appealing and the why that's often referenced is because it's so
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:39.200]   accessible.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.600]   It's one of the most accessible business investments that you can make where you've got a part
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.440]   time business and you've got an investment portfolio.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.880]   And because of the business associated with it, you can have a higher rate of return.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:58.000]   The overall rate of return from a portfolio is going to be driven based upon your level
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.400]   of involvement.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:06.760]   So the more involved you are with the, with the, with the investment, the higher the rate
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.140]   of return that you should get.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:13.440]   Think about somebody like a, think about something like somebody like a hotel magnate.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.200]   Think of someone like Conrad Hilton, the founder of the Hilton Hotels.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:26.200]   His wealth increased much, much bigger than anybody else.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:31.800]   You know, his wealth increased because of his level of involvement with Hilton Hotels.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.960]   And he put in a ton of work up front.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.920]   Then over time he transitioned to a chairman position and then over time his role became
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:40.660]   much more laid back.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:45.740]   Think of any business tycoon that you come up with and you'll find that same exact strategy
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:51.180]   where what they do is they start by, they start by putting in a ton of work and then
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:55.100]   they gradually pull back, but it's still not passive income.
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.340]   So that's how I think about passive income as far as scale.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:05.160]   If you've got tons of money, you can achieve true passive income from other people managing
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:11.040]   your portfolio, other managers, other, you know, if you hire the Coca-Cola board of directors
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.700]   to run your company for you, they're the ones who will show up to the management meetings.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.760]   They're the ones who will keep an eye on the CEO.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:22.040]   You've also hired the CEO of Coca-Cola to take care of his management team.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.720]   You've hired them to run the company and you've hired a bunch of managers, but your rate of
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:30.240]   return is going to be lower at that than it is if you're the CEO and if you're the chairman
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240]   of the board of directors.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.840]   Now, so that's, that's my comments on passive income.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.800]   Switch now to investing.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.960]   The key I think with investing is simply to look at all investments based upon some simple
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.960]   attributes.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.520]   The number one goal of an investment is to produce cash for you.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:50.080]   And so you should compare your investments across the board based upon what is the cash
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.880]   that's going to be created by these investments?
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.640]   What are the risk attributes of those investments and how am I going to integrate these investments
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.920]   into my life?
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.900]   We don't teach in our culture investing.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:05.320]   The only people that teach investing are the financial advisors who have mutual funds to
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320]   sell you.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.240]   And so that's why in general, you know, people only think of investing at, I can buy mutual
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.000]   funds or I can buy real estate.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   That's about it.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.960]   If people were to ask about that, but there are many more options.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.060]   You can buy a local Dunkin' Donuts franchise.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.860]   You can open up a local Marriott hotel subsidiary.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:29.760]   You can buy a 50% equity stake in the local lumber yard.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.980]   You can put your equity to work opening a chain of supermarkets.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:40.720]   You can be a hard money lender with local real estate investors who don't have any money.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.320]   You can be the hard money lender who backs their deals for them.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.760]   So you can put all of those things are legitimate investments.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.960]   They all have different characteristics of risk and return and require different levels
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.320]   of expertise.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:59.720]   And that's why I think we've got to understand ourselves, understand what we know and what
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.720]   we are going to be involved with, and then go and look at the marketplace and say, what
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:08.560]   is it that, what should I be focused on?
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.920]   Think of the reality TV shows that you know about the gold digger, the guys that go dig
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:14.840]   gold in Alaska.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:20.400]   So those guys are trying to leverage some kind of specialized knowledge, excuse me,
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.160]   some kind of specialized knowledge that they have of Alaskan gold fields to go out and
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   strike their fortune.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.200]   They're putting in a lot of work to hopefully make an outsized rate of return.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.120]   I'm not going to go invest in Alaskan gold fields.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.000]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.600]   But if I accumulated money from another source of business, I could go and be a capital backer
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.560]   for them and make some and be the person who puts up the stake that they use to go and
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   make the money.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.880]   I'm investing where I know with Radical Personal Finance because I know this market, I know
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:53.480]   the online business world, I know the investing world and I'm leveraging what I have behind
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.320]   me to create a business that should create much outsized rates of return.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.800]   So in my mind, it has to start with business and for somebody, you know, if you're an employee
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.760]   and you have a high degree of specialized knowledge such that you can command a high
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.320]   price from the marketplace, then that's probably where you should focus your time doing a really
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.040]   good job there and then saving the money and you're not going to have time to go and figure
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.000]   out should I buy this West Texas oil field or that West Texas oil field.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.200]   So you go ahead and just buy shares of Exxon Mobil, you know, through the context in your
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.880]   case what you said with your Vanguard index fund.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.640]   But other people who want to get there a little bit faster who don't have the expertise you
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.960]   have in the employment situation, they might go and start the local plumbing company, etc.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.440]   So to me, I see them all as integrated and the key is for us to know our goals, our abilities
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.800]   and then set out a customized specialized wealth creation plan that fits our actual
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.800]   goals.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:47.800]   That's my answer.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.800]   Awesome.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:49.800]   Thank you.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:56.000]   It's a yeah, as I think about what you're saying, the passive income, something didn't
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.880]   sound right to me about it.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:03.120]   And I think you put it in words better than I could saying that you have to leverage some
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.400]   specialized knowledge and put hard work in to get that above market return.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.960]   And it's not truly passive.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.440]   You're putting time and energy into it.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]   Right.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.560]   I think there's a false perception of passive income opportunities out there like real estate
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.560]   like you said.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.040]   I wish we could come up with a different name.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.360]   So I'll tell you as an example how I think of passive income.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.420]   I don't expect radical personal finance to ever be passive.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:33.640]   And especially because I put myself and I hope it's useful.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.520]   I figure because you all listen to the show that it can be a useful, I guess, context,
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:39.880]   you know, metaphor for me to use.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.120]   I don't expect it to be ever passive because I'm kind of at the front of it.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:50.640]   But what I'm intentionally trying to do is not trade my time for dollars.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:57.920]   And so even though it's not going to be passive, my focus is always on how can I build leverage?
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.480]   So for example, I mentioned I'm doing coaching.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.480]   All right.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.640]   Well, I'm doing coaching, but I'm not building a coaching business because if I were, if
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.000]   I wanted to build the coaching business, I should have stayed as a financial advisor
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.680]   because I had much better profit margins in that business.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:13.240]   The coaching business is a means to an end.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.840]   And I don't want the bulk of my income to be based upon me.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:19.800]   As much as I enjoy helping people, I don't want the bulk of my income to be based upon
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.640]   me helping somebody one-on-one.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:27.800]   I want it to be built upon me helping creating a product or a book or a podcast that helps
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.100]   a hundred thousand people at one time.
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.080]   And so that way, if each of those hundred thousand people says that's worth a buck,
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:37.920]   they can send me a buck in exchange for something that took me 10 hours to create.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.320]   And now my hourly rate is much, much higher.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.840]   It's not passive, but it's much more in the direction of where I can put an online store
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:45.840]   up.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:46.960]   Those products can sit there.
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.280]   They can sell night and day.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.520]   I need to manage a minimal staff, et cetera.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.120]   So there's always a path for all of us to take our skills and knowledge and work our
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:04.040]   way through and find the situation that's the best fit for us.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.040]   Any other questions?
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.160]   Who else would like to ask a question?
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160]   My voice is about shot.
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.440]   We've got 12 minutes, so we can cut it off here, but I'd be happy to answer any of the
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:18.200]   questions for the next 12 minutes that anybody has.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.680]   Going once, going twice.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.680]   All right.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.560]   Thank you all so much for being on today's call.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.560]   I appreciate you being here.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.560]   This was really fun.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:34.600]   I will be doing, again, many more of these for those of you who are members of the show
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.600]   at 10 bucks and up patron over the coming weeks.
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.000]   I'll give some thoughts of moving the times around as you guys have suggested so that
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.760]   maybe more of you can participate.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.720]   I really enjoy, they won't be two hours, but they might be an hour.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.320]   And I really enjoy talking with you guys.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:56.680]   Hopefully this has been useful and I really appreciate answering the questions.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.680]   In conclusion, thank you guys so much for your support.
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:08.840]   Much of you on the line are patrons of the show and I've intentionally built the show
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.400]   the way that I have based upon the patrons first, just to see if I could do it.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:19.520]   And it makes such a huge difference to be able to have you as individual patrons supporting
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.520]   the show.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.360]   And I really love the way it incentivizes me.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.600]   And it's really awesome to talk with you guys.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.520]   It gets a little lonely sometimes behind a microphone because you're just one person
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:34.280]   speaking out into the online world, but it's really awesome to be able to be in a situation
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.800]   like this and talk with you face to face.
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:41.080]   So I wish you a beautiful rest of your day and I wish you all tremendous success and
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.280]   fulfillment in every area.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.720]   And thank you all so much for calling in.
