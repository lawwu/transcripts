[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.400]   We got a question here from a frustrated mom who
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.280]   is asking about college admissions hysteria
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.800]   and the selectivity of colleges for future employment.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.520]   Let me excerpt this question a little bit.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.640]   But this querier says, my teenager
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.440]   is utterly unmotivated and likely
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.960]   has an undiagnosed learning disability
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   because she seems quite intelligent outside
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.320]   of academics.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.200]   I'm in California, where kids seem
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.520]   to take an average of eight AP exams
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.600]   and seem to have weighted GPAs over four.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.520]   I worry for her future, and it upsets me
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.680]   when people point to examples like Steve Jobs or Larry
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.520]   Ellison and claim a college degree is not
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.560]   important to succeed.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.120]   If this were true, then please tell me
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.880]   why companies aren't lining up to hire out
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.440]   of high school or community college or second tier schools
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.960]   but all make a beeline to hire from the Ivies.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.680]   And she says, what about kids who
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680]   need to work or can't handle the pressure of doing it all?
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.920]   If college was so optional, then why the hiring queues
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.580]   outside of Harvard and Princeton and why
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.720]   the sentencing of teens who didn't do it all at an already
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600]   vulnerable time in their lives?
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.020]   All right, so frustrated mom, this
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.360]   is something I used to do a lot of work on,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   college admissions stress.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.160]   When I was a graduate student in the first decade
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.000]   of the 2000s, there was a huge issue
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.220]   with college student stress because of two things
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.120]   that occurred during this period.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.080]   One was demographics.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   So I'm a part of the millennial generation, which
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.620]   is the children of the baby boomers.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.200]   It's a very large demographic group.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.800]   I'm at the very older end of the millennials, right?
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.320]   So I'm one of the first millennials.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.660]   So when I was just arriving at graduate school,
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.680]   you had a huge number of millennials
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.460]   entering college admission season.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.760]   So there was suddenly this huge strain on college admissions.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.520]   And then at the same time, they introduced
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.840]   the common application.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.080]   So it used to be, like when I applied to school,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.440]   when I wanted to apply, I applied to Dartmouth.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.040]   There was an application for Dartmouth.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.500]   And I had to go use a typewriter at my dad's office
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800]   because you had to typewrite in information in the fields.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.840]   And for your essays, you would write your essays
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.440]   and print them.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.480]   And I vaguely remember pasting them into this thing.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800]   I mean, the application was a physical booklet
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   you would send away for.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.940]   You would send them money.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.600]   And they would send you back this thing.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.960]   And it was a huge pain.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.240]   So you were pretty selective.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.500]   I'm applying to three schools.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.240]   And it took me a while.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.280]   But the common app, it was, oh, I'd
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.400]   fill out all this information on the website once.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.120]   And I can apply to anywhere I want just by clicking a button.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.080]   And now suddenly, people were applying to 20, 30 schools.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.800]   And everyone who was at least a little bit smart
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.160]   would say, well, I might as well just do Harvard.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.920]   I might as well do Princeton.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   I might as well do Yale.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   You never know.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.640]   And suddenly, they had these admissions percentages
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   that just seemed like they were plummeting, when in reality,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.880]   it was just you had a bunch more people applying who never would
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.080]   have before because they already knew
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.000]   they weren't going to get in.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.200]   Anyways, it caused a huge issue.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.680]   College admission stress became a problem.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.800]   There was a bunch of national cases, case studies
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.920]   that were drawing national attention, like Gunn High
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.660]   School in Palo Alto, California, where
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.800]   they had a string of suicides.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.320]   This was starting to happen with high school students.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.400]   Which is all to say I wrote a book eventually called
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.640]   How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.360]   And it was all about defusing college admissions stress.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.600]   So I feel your pain.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.040]   Let me give you a few points before I just
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.640]   say read that book, which, by the way,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.480]   I think you're going to like.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.880]   But let me give you a few points.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.240]   Yes, college matters.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.440]   Ignore the Silicon Valley types that say
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.620]   Steve Jobs didn't go to college.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.280]   Because your kid's not Steve Jobs.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.840]   And your kid's not Larry Ellison.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.220]   And so yes, if you want to do a knowledge sector
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.200]   type job, like an office job, for better or for worse,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.840]   you have to go to college.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600]   There are obviously other types of work.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.640]   Read Matt Crawford's book, Shop Classes, Soul Craft,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   that there's a lot of other really good work that
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.400]   has to do with skilled manual trades, which
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.040]   I think we definitely overlook.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.080]   But I think the people for which that is well suited know that.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.880]   It doesn't sound like this is your daughter.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.340]   Like there's some people that know,
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.800]   like I want to repair things and fix things or work on a ranch.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.300]   And the people who want to do that know they want to do that.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.080]   And I think we need to normalize that more.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.320]   And that's not your path.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   Yeah, college matters.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.520]   So yes, I agree.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.480]   You can't just skip colleges.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.520]   I also agree, yes, it's true that the very selective
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.040]   colleges open up a lot more opportunities, especially
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   for very high paying elite jobs.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.760]   They go to the very selective colleges
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.600]   to do that type of recruiting.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.480]   There was this famous study that everyone
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.100]   kept talking about during that first wave of college stress.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.400]   There's this famous study that people are talking about
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.040]   that said, aha, it doesn't matter what school you go to.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.480]   See, we did this study where we looked
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   at students who got into good schools,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   but also to less good schools, and went to the less good
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.080]   school, and some went to the better school,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.800]   and it didn't matter.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.160]   In the end, they both did as well.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.460]   So it's the person, not the school that really matters.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.420]   This study was really popular because people like that idea.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.040]   Don't over sweat the school you go to.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.120]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   I wrote an article about this way back when, like in 2008.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.840]   That's a crazy interpretation of the data.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.300]   If you actually look at this study,
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.680]   it turned out to matter quite a bit, actually.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.960]   If you went to a better school, you made more money out of it.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   It was crazy the interpretations that media outlets
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.880]   were making of that study.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.600]   And I don't mean to go on a tangent here,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   but basically there was one way you
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.200]   could rank schools by which you could
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.400]   show that effect went away.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.720]   That's something to do with the median SAT score.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.840]   But if you looked at the most natural way
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.720]   to rank schools, which was looking at their ranking in a--
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.600]   it wasn't US News, might have been Barron's, but whatever.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.200]   Just looking at their ranking, it made a big difference.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.520]   In these dyads, the students who went to the higher ranked
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.480]   school versus the lowest ranked school made more money.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.440]   OK, so that's true.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.740]   There's jobs that are open to people in the Ivy leagues
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.720]   that aren't open otherwise.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   You can't do much about that.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.640]   Can't do much about that.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240]   That's true.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.760]   But I'm going to try to make you feel better here frustrated,
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   mom.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.440]   I don't think you want most of those jobs.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.160]   Yes, you can be a derivatives trader.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.720]   You can be a management consultant.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.760]   And you can get into really good law schools.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.280]   But I don't know that you--
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   so?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120]   So where does that end you?
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   That you have a very expensive penthouse apartment in New
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.240]   York.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   You're also completely stressed out and alienated
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.200]   from your family because you're a managing director
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   at a big bank.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.080]   Some people want to do that.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.840]   Most people don't.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.120]   So that's my first point.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.600]   So what?
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.120]   And then two, I would say, don't think about that hype.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.160]   Go to a good school.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.640]   Go to the best school you can get into.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.400]   Do well when you're at that school.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.840]   Find an interesting job that gives you options.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.000]   Do career capital theory and lifestyle-centric career
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.240]   planning.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.600]   Make yourself an awesome life.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.480]   That's the recipe.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.800]   And California is crazy about this stuff.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.920]   DC is kind of bad about it.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.600]   California is crazy about this type of college stuff.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.280]   And they really-- and I can see it in your question,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.360]   so I have so much empathy here.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.840]   But they really get under your skin
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.920]   and make it seem like, well, if you're not going to Yale
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.240]   or University of Chicago, dot, dot, dot.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.000]   But you know what?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.920]   Follow out that dot, dot, dot.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.280]   What happens?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.520]   Yeah, I don't get to go work for Goldman Sachs.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.000]   I would say congratulations.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.720]   You don't want to do that anyways, right?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.680]   I mean, what happens?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.720]   So you focus on your grades.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.800]   Get the best grades you can.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.840]   Go to a good school.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.040]   My advice is typically go to your state school
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.600]   unless you can get into a small number of very elite schools
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.360]   that are much, much better than your state school.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.760]   I'm a bit of a curmudgeon on this.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.660]   I'm not a big believer in shopping
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.300]   for random private schools that are nowhere near you
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.880]   just because you like the look of the campus.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.440]   I mean this with respect, teenagers,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.320]   because I'm talking about myself at that age.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.640]   But 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds are idiots.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.840]   How much do we really want to give them
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.720]   weight to their decision of, no, I definitely
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   need to go to this random school halfway across the country?
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.840]   I was like, go to your state school probably
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.040]   unless you can get into a fantastic school.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.760]   OK, if you're really into government and politics
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.000]   and get into Georgetown, go to Georgetown.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.480]   But don't go to a random private school halfway
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.360]   around the country because you like something
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.440]   in their brochure about their gym and the campus look nice.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   Go to your state school unless you get into an elite school.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.640]   Don't overschedule.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.860]   Do really well in your major.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.080]   Get good grades.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.600]   This will open up job opportunities.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.080]   Build a cool life.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.720]   I think that's the takeaway message.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.920]   So to bring that back to my book, what I did in that book,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.540]   How to Become a High School Superstar,
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.520]   is I profiled a bunch of kids that
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.280]   did fine in college admissions but weren't at all stressed out.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.200]   And I kind of walked through what their life was like,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.280]   what matters, what doesn't.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.000]   And spoiler alert, they're not overscheduled.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.680]   They wander and stumble into interesting things.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.560]   They're pretty smart about their study habits,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.140]   so they get good grades without having to study all the time.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.520]   And that's kind of it.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.760]   So I am giving you permission, frustrated mom,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.480]   to not get too caught up in this selective college hysteria.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   You should help your daughter with good study habits.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.720]   Don't overschedule her.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   Let her live up to her academic potential.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.760]   Go to the good school, maybe one of the great UC system schools.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.560]   Don't pay twice as much to go to a school across the country.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.640]   And let them do well there.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.920]   Read my type of advice.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   Find themselves.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.640]   Find their flow.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.360]   Do good work.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.520]   And then lifestyle-centered career planning,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.160]   build a really cool, interesting life.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.600]   I think that is what most people should be doing.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.960]   And we need to stop obsessing about this dream that,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.560]   I don't know, you're going to go to Harvard and then the Yale
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.040]   Law School and be like a senator at 30 or something like that.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.640]   Hey, spoiler alert, that's not going to happen to you.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.240]   It's going to happen to a small number of people.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.120]   But don't build your whole life around that's
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520]   what you need to do, I guess.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.120]   Jesse, did you have that pressure?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.880]   How do you remember that college?
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.480]   Because we were the same age.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.640]   It's funny you bring up the Common Application.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.840]   Because it got worse right after we
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.040]   went through this whole thing.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.680]   Yeah, I mean, the Common Application
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.640]   was key to me because I never would have applied to Tufts
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.440]   if they didn't take it.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.040]   I just submitted it at the last minute
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.400]   and ended up getting accepted.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.280]   And then once I weighed other schools,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.920]   I selected it and ended up having a great time and loved
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.560]   it.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.040]   But I didn't think about the admission rates
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.840]   with the Common Application until you just mentioned it.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.520]   It inflated them.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.960]   So it made it seem super impossible.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.880]   I mean, the point I make in that book
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.520]   is the key thing about college admissions
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.000]   is that it is a vanishingly small number of schools
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   and students for which things like your extracurricular
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.040]   activities or whatever matters.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.520]   For the vast majority of colleges
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   and the vast majority of kids, what's your grades?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.120]   What's your SAT scores?
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.240]   Are they in the range of our accepted students?
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.280]   Yes, you get to come here.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.700]   That's the vast majority of colleges,
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.780]   the vast majority of kids.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.840]   So get the best grades you can.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.520]   Get good SAT scores.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.440]   Find schools that you're in the middle of that range.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   Go to those schools.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.080]   Don't even sweat it.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.040]   It's such a small subset of people
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.080]   for which you're applying to a school in which they're like,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.640]   we have so many students who have
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.120]   grades that are pegged at the top of our range
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   that now we have to start differentiating
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.400]   among other factors.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.080]   But even then, that's not most students,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.160]   because a lot of those slots are reserved for various sports
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.940]   or for the orchestra needs someone.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.040]   So now we're down to a really small number of students.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.160]   And then there's some shoo-ins, because these type of colleges
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.400]   want as interesting as a possible of class.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   So there's just some really interesting people.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.280]   And then there's people who are daughters of presidents.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.120]   So they need to come here too, because we're
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.680]   trying to create a whatever.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.440]   And now we're down to a very small number of slots
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.680]   at a very small number of schools
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.840]   where you have an admissions officer saying,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.560]   what activities do you do?
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.480]   So I think we definitely overblow that.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.760]   Everyone is obsessed with what are my activities.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.000]   And they're wrong about it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.500]   That's the whole point in that book.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.320]   One of the big points in my book is
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.000]   that people are wrong in terms of what
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.160]   they think is important when it comes to activities.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.360]   They focus way too much on quantity,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   thinking somehow that raw quantity of activities
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.560]   is somehow impressive.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.200]   It's not.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.160]   Or they fall into the trap of looking
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.240]   for activities that have incredibly clear competitive
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.200]   structures, like am I the first chair of the state orchestra?
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.560]   Only one person in your state gets
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.760]   to be that for the instrument.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.000]   So it's not necessarily a great place to be competing.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.960]   So I don't mean to rant.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   But I just want to give more people permission to say,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.760]   I'm going to get the grades that--
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.280]   I'm going to work hard, get good grades,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.120]   see what schools that opens up, go to that school,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   have a good experience in that school, build a cool life.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   And we-- and of course, I'm saying
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.040]   this as someone who went to an Ivy League school
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.880]   and trained at MIT.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.240]   So maybe it's easy for me to say.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.320]   But I don't know that my school opened up
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.200]   for the vast majority of my peers
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.960]   really cool, interesting, happy lives.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.240]   They all just went to Harvard Law School.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.200]   Everyone I know just went to Harvard Law School
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.240]   and are all law partners now and are tired.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.520]   So congratulations.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   They have nice houses, though.
