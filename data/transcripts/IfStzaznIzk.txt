[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Hey everyone, this is Tony with Pastor John in studio for a special episode of the Ask
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.400]   Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.060]   As I'm sure you're all aware, the coronavirus continues to grab headlines as it spreads
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.920]   across the globe now in 53 different countries.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.200]   Infection numbers globally are over 83,000 now, fatalities nearing 3,000.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   It's a multinational epidemic now moving toward a global pandemic.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.020]   Wednesday morning the president tasked the vice president with stopping the virus here
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.120]   in the states.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.300]   Some are hopeful this can be done, others claim this is futile.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.500]   It won't be stopped and will continue to spread for months.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.120]   Some experts are going so far as to say a majority of Americans will be exposed to the
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000]   virus before this is all said and done.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.400]   There's a lot of speculation afoot.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100]   Less theoretically, world markets are tumbling.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360]   The Dow Jones continues to nosedive this week as international work stoppages interrupt
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560]   imports, exports, and global trade.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.580]   In situations like this, it's very easy to lose faith and to live in fear of the headlines
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580]   and the unknowns.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.280]   And this global uncertainty has now reached into the states.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.800]   But several days ago, we began hearing from podcast listeners around Southeast Asia who
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.440]   offered updates on the situation there.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.760]   That includes a man in Singapore who wrote us this.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.180]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420]   I listen to every episode of this podcast from my home in Singapore.
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.680]   I thank God for you.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340]   I'd like to ask you about the unfolding coronavirus outbreak that started in China
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.960]   and has gone on to infect many more around the world.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.700]   When it reached Singapore, the government and citizens responded well and our collective
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.820]   efforts won international praise.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.960]   But church responses were mixed.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.460]   Several continued with Sunday services with added precautions.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.160]   Some suspended church services altogether.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.380]   Some pastors are promising, "If you are a believer, God will not allow this virus
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.900]   to touch you."
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.220]   Other pastors are saying, "This is God's judgment on sinful cities and arrogant nations."
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.820]   Pastor John, how do Christians with open Bibles make sense of a viral epidemic like this one?
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.980]   Well, I'm going to try to answer the question that was asked.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.500]   How do you make sense?
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.340]   How do you get understanding with an open Bible in front of me?
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.920]   But before I do, let me just say, I have misgivings because I make a distinction between helping
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.340]   people get ready to suffer with making sense of biblical teaching about suffering.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.340]   That's one thing.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.180]   And then another thing is physically, emotionally embodying that theology in the moment when
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.660]   somebody is suffering.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580]   And we've got thousands of people now who are dying, which means hundreds of thousands
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.140]   of people who are grieving.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.340]   And what I'm about to say might not be well-timed in some of their lives, because if I were
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.780]   on the ground in a church, I would be discerning whether there's a time to speak here or not.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.620]   But with that preface, let me try to own what I've been asked to do, make sense of a deadly
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.620]   virus.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.660]   So let's start with an empirical historical fact and a clear Bible fact.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.580]   The empirical fact is that on the Lord's Day, Sunday, December 26, 2004, over 200,000
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:29.220]   people were killed by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean, including whole churches gathered for
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.740]   worship on the Lord's Day, swept away in death.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.100]   That's the historical fact.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.740]   That sort of thing has happened to Christians as long as there have been Christians.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.300]   Now the biblical fact is Mark 4, 41.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.540]   Even the wind and the sea obey Jesus.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.900]   That is as true today as it was then.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.820]   Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.100]   So put those two facts together, the historical fact and the biblical fact, and you get this
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.420]   truth.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:15.380]   Jesus could have stopped the natural disaster, and he did not in 2004.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.740]   Since he always does what is wise and right and just and good, therefore he had wise and
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.380]   good purposes in that deadly disaster.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.060]   I would say the same thing, therefore, about the coronavirus.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.660]   Jesus has all foreknowledge, all authority over the natural and supernatural forces of
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.940]   this world.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.180]   He knows exactly where the virus started, where it's going next.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.460]   He has complete power to restrain it or not, and that's what's happening.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.420]   Neither sin nor Satan nor sickness nor sabotage is stronger than Jesus.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.420]   He's never backed into a corner.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.780]   He is never forced to tolerate what he does not will.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.780]   The counsel of the Lord stands forever, his plans, the plans of his heart to all generations,
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.180]   Psalm 33, 11.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   "I know that you can do all things," Job says in his own repentance, "and that no purpose
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.380]   of yours can be thwarted," Job 42, 2.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.660]   So the question is not, is Jesus overseeing, limiting, guiding, governing all the disasters
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.620]   and all the diseases of the world, including all their sinful and satanic dimensions?
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.140]   He is.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.980]   The question is, with our Bibles open, how are we to understand this?
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.020]   Can we make sense out of it?
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.620]   So here are four biblical realities which we can use as building blocks in our effort
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.980]   to understand and make sense of it.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.540]   Number one, building block.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.900]   Number one, when sin entered the world through Adam and Eve, God ordained that the created
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.660]   order, including our physical bodies as persons created in his image, would experience corruption
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.620]   and futility and that all living things would die.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.500]   Christians by being saved through the gospel of God's grace do not escape this physical
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   corruption, futility, and death.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.940]   The basis of this point is Romans 8, 20 to 23.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:49.460]   The creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him, God, who subjected
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.060]   it in hope that the creation itself would be set free from its bondage to corruption
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.500]   and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.780]   For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.780]   until now.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.140]   And here's the key verse for Christians.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:15.020]   And not only the creation, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:22.860]   inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:31.340]   The day is coming when all creation will be set free from its bondage to disease and disaster
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.900]   and death and inherit the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.420]   Until then, Christians, what Paul says, "Even we who have the spirit."
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.940]   Christians groan with all creation, sharing in the corruption and futility and disease
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:57.020]   and disasters and death as we wait with groaning the redemption of our bodies that happens
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.580]   at the resurrection.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.820]   The difference for Christians who trust Christ is that our experience of this corruption
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.580]   is not condemnation.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.780]   Romans 8, 1, "There is therefore now no condemnation."
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.260]   The pain for us is purifying, not punitive.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.980]   God has not destined us for wrath.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.420]   1 Thessalonians 5, 10, "We die of disease like all men."
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.820]   Not necessarily because of any particular sin.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.300]   That's really important.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.180]   We die of disease like all people because of the fall.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.660]   But for those who are in Christ, the sting of death is removed.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.060]   1 Corinthians 15, 55.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.540]   It's building block number one for understanding what's going on.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.860]   Number two, God sometimes inflicts sickness on his people as a purifying and rescuing
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:00.300]   judgment which is not a condemnation but an act of mercy for his saving purposes.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   That point is based on 1 Corinthians 11, 29 to 32.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:10.780]   That text deals with misusing the Lord's Supper, but the principle is broader.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   Here it is.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.660]   "Anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself."
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.100]   This is Christians at the Lord's table.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:29.740]   "That is why many of you, you Christians, are weak and ill, ill, ill, and some have
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.420]   died.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.660]   But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.740]   But when we are judged by the Lord, the Lord Jesus, when we are judged by the Lord Jesus
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.060]   with this illness and weakness and death, when we are judged by disease and death by
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:55.700]   the Lord, we are disciplined, paiduamitho, disciplined like a child, so that we may not
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.540]   be condemned along with the world."
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.940]   Now let that sink in.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:10.020]   The Lord Jesus takes the life of his loved ones through weakness and illness—the very
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:17.300]   same words, by the way, used to describe the weaknesses and illnesses that Jesus heals
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.660]   in his earthly life, Matthew 14, 14—and brings them to heaven.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:28.300]   He brings them to heaven because of the trajectory of their sin that he was cutting off and saving
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.620]   them from, but not to punish them, but to save them.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:38.580]   In other words, some of us die of illnesses, quote, "that we may not be condemned along
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.500]   with the world," verse 32.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:49.480]   If he can do that in a few of his loved ones in Corinth, he can do it to many, including
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:55.360]   by the coronavirus, and not just because of abusing the Lord's Supper, but also for
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:03.140]   other kinds of sinful trajectories, though not all death is for a particular sin.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.580]   That's building block number two.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.380]   Here's number three.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:13.860]   God sometimes uses disease to bring particular judgments upon those who reject him and give
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.500]   themselves over to sin.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   Two examples.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   Acts 12, 23.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.140]   "Herod the king exalted in being called a god."
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.680]   He exalted himself.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.280]   And verse 23, "Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.700]   glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last."
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:45.860]   God can do that with any man or with anyone who exalt themselves, which means we should
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:53.100]   be amazed that more of our rulers do not drop dead every day because of their arrogance
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.220]   before God and man.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.100]   Sheer common grace and mercy.
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.500]   Another example is the sin of homosexual intercourse in Romans 1, 27.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.460]   It says, "Likewise, men gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.060]   passion for one another.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:24.580]   Men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty of
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.580]   their error."
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:32.820]   Now, that's an example of the wrath of God in verse 18 of Romans 1, where it says, "The
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:39.580]   wrath of God is being now revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.060]   of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth."
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:52.620]   That's building block number three, that God can and does use illnesses to bring judgment
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.460]   sometimes upon those who reject him in his way.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.260]   And here's the last one, number four.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:10.780]   All natural disasters, whether floods, famines, locusts, tsunamis, or diseases, are a thunderclap
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   of divine mercy in the midst of judgment, calling all people everywhere to repent and
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.980]   realign their lives by grace with the infinite worth of the glory of God.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.620]   And the basis for that building block is Luke 13, 1-5.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:34.500]   Pilate had slaughtered worshipers in the temple, and the tower of Siloam had collapsed and
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   killed 18 bystanders.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.580]   And the crowds want to know from Jesus, just like I've been asked, "Okay, make sense
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   of this, Jesus.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.460]   Tell us what you think about these natural disasters and this cruelty.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.780]   These people were just standing there, and now they're dead."
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.100]   And here's Jesus' answer in Luke 13, 5.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:57.140]   Those 18 on whom the tower of Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.940]   worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem?
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.580]   No, I tell you.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.380]   But unless you repent, He shifts from them to you.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.100]   You, unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:22.020]   Now that's the message of Jesus to the world at this moment in history under the coronavirus.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:28.900]   A message to every single human being, me and you, Tony, and everybody who's listening,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:34.780]   and every ruler on the planet, every person who hears about this is receiving a thunderclap
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.980]   message of God saying, "Repent."
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.020]   And I think the Chinese authorities should especially pay attention who have recently—and
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:52.740]   I just read another article yesterday—recently have become so increasingly harsh and repressive
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.620]   against the followers of Christ.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:04.500]   Repent and seek God's mercy to bring your lives, our lives, into alignment with His
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.060]   infinite worth.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.980]   A thunderclap of God saying, "Repent."
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.700]   That's powerful and urgent.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.540]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that word.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.020]   Well, because we have international listeners in Singapore and all around the globe and
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.340]   in Southeast Asia, it would be really fascinating to hear what you're seeing on the ground in
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.040]   your own community.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.380]   How is God using this global disruption to reach people with the hope of the gospel?
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.220]   How are churches responding in your community to minister to others?
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.220]   Are they open?
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.220]   Are they closing?
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.860]   And what are preachers saying?
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.020]   If you have any observations to share with us, we would love to hear what you're seeing
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.760]   in your own community.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.500]   You can email those observations to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.980]   That's askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.580]   Thanks for listening to this special episode of Ask Pastor John.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.780]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.220]   Pastor John and I return next week.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.740]   Until then, stay safe, wash your hands, cover your coughs, love your family, serve your
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.740]   neighbor, treasure Jesus.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.340]   We'll see you on Monday.
