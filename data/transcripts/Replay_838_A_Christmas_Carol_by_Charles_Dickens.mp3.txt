[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.540]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.460]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.460]   I'm your host today.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:27.700]   You'll notice that my emphasis is on living a rich life now, a meaningful life now, and
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700]   on the word insight.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.640]   You'll understand that today I want to talk about what it means to live a rich and meaningful
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.420]   life and then I want to use a classic resource to draw some of the lessons.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.020]   As I record this, it is Tuesday, December 21, 2021 for all the number aficionados, 12,
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.500]   21, 21, which is of course a fun number.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.700]   And I want to share with you today a classic tale of what it means to balance money with
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.300]   other aspects of your life.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.500]   The tale is A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, a very well-known story.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.900]   But in my experience, for those who are aware of The Christmas Carol, it's much more likely
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.300]   that your exposure to this story will have come from a theatrical production.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.920]   It's a very commonly performed play.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.940]   Last year my wife and I went and enjoyed a stage production of A Christmas Carol.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.720]   But although I've seen a number of stage productions and enjoyed them all, and I think they work
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.020]   hard to convey the truths, the meaning behind this particular story, as is quite common,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.480]   those stage productions can't, by virtue of the way that they're presented, they simply
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.820]   cannot articulate all of the original intent of the author.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.240]   And when Charles Dickens wrote this particular story, he was writing about money and about
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   life.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.920]   And as I was rereading this story this year with my children, we were going through and
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   reading it to them, I was just struck by how perfect it was as a useful parable for us
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.920]   here at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.560]   And so in today's episode, I want to read to you this story.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.860]   I want to encourage you, if you've read it recently, great, or read the story, listen
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860]   to it again.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.060]   But I want to encourage you, many of you may find this difficult, but I will do my best
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.900]   to read it in a way that is engaging.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.260]   If my young children can engage with it, even though the words may be unfamiliar at times,
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.660]   or the sentence construction a little bit different than what we're accustomed to, then
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.260]   I am quite confident that you would enjoy it.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.200]   And I want you to listen for the commentary on money and think about, as we consider the
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.960]   experiences that Scrooge himself goes through, I want you to think about the meaning and
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.520]   how you can apply these lessons to your own life.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.360]   Especially as is normal with a book, we get to interact with the thoughts and the feelings
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.640]   of the protagonist.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.160]   I think this is such a valuable parable for us to consider, both now in the Christmas
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.080]   season and later.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.220]   So enjoy my particular reading of A Christmas Carol in Prose, being A Ghost Story of Christmas
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.100]   by Charles Dickens.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.780]   Stave one, Marley's Ghost.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.800]   Marley was dead, to begin with.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.060]   There is no doubt whatever about that.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.740]   The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.500]   the chief mourner.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.660]   Scrooge signed it.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.220]   And Scrooge's name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.100]   Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.540]   Mind, I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what there is particularly
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.300]   dead about a doornail.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.580]   I might have been inclined myself to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of iron
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.360]   mongery in the trade.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.660]   But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile, and my unhallowed hands shall not
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.400]   disturb it, or the country's done for.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   You will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that Marley was as dead as a doornail.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   Scrooge knew he was dead?
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   Of course he did.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.680]   How could it be otherwise?
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.340]   Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.000]   Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.520]   his sole friend, and sole mourner.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.040]   And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.600]   The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.080]   There is no doubt that Marley was dead.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.420]   This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.560]   to relate.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.020]   be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.400]   his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   out after dark in a breezy spot, say St. Paul's churchyard for instance, literally to astonish
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.840]   his son's weak mind.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.340]   Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.280]   There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.420]   Scrooge and Marley.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.800]   The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.960]   Sometimes people knew to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.280]   he answered to both names.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.000]   It was all the same to him.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Oh, but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.560]   A squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.880]   Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.320]   Secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.040]   The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.920]   stiffened his gait, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and spoke out shrewdly in
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.040]   his grating voice.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.560]   A frosty rhyme was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.680]   He carried his own low temperature always about with him.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.200]   He iced his office in the dog days, and didn't thaw at one degree at Christmas.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.840]   External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.880]   No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.980]   No wind that blew was bitterer than he.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.860]   No falling snow was more intent upon its purpose.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.480]   No pelting rain less open to entreaty.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.000]   Foul weather didn't know where to have him.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.660]   The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the advantage over him
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.580]   in only one respect.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.160]   They often came down handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160]   how are you?
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.880]   When will you come to see me?"
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.280]   No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.600]   No children asked him what it was o'clock.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.200]   No man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.040]   of Scrooge.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him, and when they saw him coming on, would
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   tug their owners into doorways and up courts, and then would wag their tails as though they
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.720]   said, "No eye at all is better than an evil eye, Dark Master."
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.560]   But what did Scrooge care?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.580]   It was the very thing he liked.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.720]   To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.240]   distance was what the Knowing Ones called "nuts" to Scrooge.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   Once upon a time, of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve, old Scrooge sat
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   busy in his counting house.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It was cold, bleak, biting weather, foggy with all, and he could hear the people in
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.040]   the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts and
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.600]   stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.320]   The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   It had not been light all day, and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.500]   offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.520]   The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without that, although
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.500]   the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.680]   To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.400]   The door of Scrooge's counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.640]   who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.800]   Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.000]   like one coal, but he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal box in his own
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.880]   room, and so surely as the clerk came in with a shovel, the master predicted that it would
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.600]   be necessary for them to part.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to imagine himself at the candle,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.400]   in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.300]   "A Merry Christmas, Uncle, God save you!" cried a cheerful voice.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.520]   It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.920]   first intimation he had of his approach.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   "Bah!" said Scrooge.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.040]   "Humbug!"
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.160]   He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.960]   that he was all in a glow.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.800]   His face was ruddy and handsome, his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.000]   "Christmas, a humbug, Uncle," said Scrooge's nephew.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.800]   "You don't mean that, I'm sure."
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.720]   "I do," said Scrooge.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.320]   "Merry Christmas.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.760]   What right have you to be merry?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.280]   What reason have you to be merry?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   You're poor enough."
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.200]   "Come then," returned the nephew gaily.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.960]   "What right have you to be dismal?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.480]   What right have you to be morose?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.680]   You're rich enough."
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.720]   Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said, "Bah!" again, and
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.760]   followed it up with, "Humbug!"
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.800]   "Don't be cross, Uncle," said the nephew.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.360]   "What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I live in such a world of fools as
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   this?
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.600]   Merry Christmas, out upon merry Christmas.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.160]   What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money?
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.280]   A time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer?
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.720]   A time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.520]   months presented dead against you?
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:28.120]   If I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.720]   on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.640]   his heart, he should."
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.280]   "Uncle," pleaded the nephew.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:44.680]   "Nephew," returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   it in mine."
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.440]   "Keep it," repeated Scrooge's nephew, "but you don't keep it."
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   "Let me leave it alone then," said Scrooge.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.840]   "Much good may it do you, much good it has ever done you."
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.600]   "There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.160]   I dare say," returned the nephew, "Christmas among the rest, but I am sure I have always
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.700]   thought of Christmas time when it has come round, apart from the veneration due its sacred
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.840]   name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that, as a good time,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.320]   a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time, the only time I know of in the long calendar
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.600]   of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.160]   and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.720]   and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.040]   And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   I believe that it has done me good and will do me good, and I say God bless it."
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.160]   The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.880]   Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire and extinguished the last
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   frail spark forever.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   "Let me hear another sound from you," said Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.840]   by losing your situation."
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.560]   "You're quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his nephew.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.760]   "I wonder you don't go into Parliament."
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.160]   "Don't be angry, uncle.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560]   Come dine with us tomorrow."
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.200]   Scrooge said that he would see him.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.040]   Yes, indeed he did.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.680]   He went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   first.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.600]   "But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   "Why?"
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.840]   "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080]   "Because I fell in love."
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.280]   "Because you fell in love?"
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.760]   growled Scrooge, as if that were the only thing in the world more ridiculous than a
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.240]   Merry Christmas.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.920]   "Good afternoon."
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.680]   "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.280]   Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.360]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   "I want nothing from you.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   I ask nothing of you.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.120]   Why cannot we be friends?"
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.640]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.500]   "I am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.320]   We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party, but I have made the trial
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.400]   in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.320]   So a Merry Christmas, uncle."
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.120]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.720]   "And a Happy New Year."
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.600]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.200]   His nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.680]   He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.120]   cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge, for he returned them cordially.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.320]   "There is another fellow," muttered Scrooge, who overheard him.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.360]   "My clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a Merry
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   Christmas.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   I'll retire to bedlam."
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.200]   This lunatic in letting Scrooge's nephew out had let two other people in.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.800]   They were a portly gentleman, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   in Scrooge's office.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.360]   They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.840]   "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.800]   "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?"
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.320]   "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.720]   "He died seven years ago, this very night."
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.360]   "We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner," said
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.280]   the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.160]   It certainly was, for they had been two kindred spirits.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:04.920]   At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge frowned, shook his head, and handed the credentials
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   back.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.840]   "At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the gentleman, taking up a
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.600]   pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.880]   for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.080]   Many thousands are in want of common necessaries.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.000]   Hundreds of thousands are in want of common comfort, sir."
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.600]   "Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.960]   "Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.200]   "And the union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.360]   "Are they still in operation?"
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   "They are still," returned the gentleman.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.320]   "I wish I could say they were not."
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.520]   "The treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour, then?" said Scrooge.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.880]   "Both very busy, sir."
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.000]   "Oh, I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.880]   them in their useful course," said Scrooge.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.840]   "I am very glad to hear it."
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.560]   "Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.160]   the multitude," returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring to raise a
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.760]   We choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.800]   rejoices.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.160]   What shall I put you down for?"
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.440]   "Nothing," Scrooge replied.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.360]   "You wish to be anonymous?"
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.400]   "I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.000]   "Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.920]   I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.560]   I help to support the establishments I have mentioned.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.520]   They cost enough, and those who are badly off must go there.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.200]   Many can't go there, and many would rather die."
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.640]   "If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it and decrease the surplus
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   population.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   Besides, excuse me, I don't know that."
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.640]   "But you might know it," observed the gentleman.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.000]   "It's not my business," Scrooge returned.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.320]   "It's enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   people's.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.040]   Mine occupies me constantly.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.680]   Good afternoon, gentlemen."
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.440]   Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentleman withdrew.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.840]   Scrooge resumed his labors with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.880]   temper than was usual with him.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:44.720]   Meanwhile, the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.760]   proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.640]   The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.480]   Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible and struck the hours and
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.800]   quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.120]   in its frozen head up there.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.960]   The cold became intense.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.480]   In the main street, at the corner of the court, some laborers were repairing the gas pipes
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.680]   and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.640]   were gathered, warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.880]   The water plug, being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.640]   to misanthropic ice.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.680]   The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.840]   windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.880]   Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke, a glorious pageant, with
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.160]   which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.800]   had anything to do.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.520]   The Lord Mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.560]   and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household should, and even the little tailor
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.080]   whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.400]   the streets stirred up tomorrow's pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   baby sallied out to buy the beef.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:27.680]   Foggier yet and colder, piercing, searching, biting cold.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.380]   If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit's nose with a touch of such
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.920]   weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.520]   to lusty purpose.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.920]   The owner of one's scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.800]   gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.280]   but at the first sound of "God bless you, merry gentlemen, may nothing you dismay,"
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.960]   Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.640]   leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.440]   At length the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:17.680]   With an ill will, Scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.600]   the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.400]   "You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose," said Scrooge.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   "If quite convenient, sir."
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.560]   "It's not convenient," said Scrooge.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.360]   "And it's not fair.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.720]   If I was to stop half a crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound."
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.800]   The clerk smiled faintly.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.320]   "And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used when I pay a day's wages for no
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   work?"
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.040]   The clerk observed that it was only once a year.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.840]   "A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December," said Scrooge, buttoning
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.200]   his greatcoat to the chin.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.000]   "But I suppose you must have the whole day.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.720]   Be here all the earlier next morning."
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.360]   The clerk promised that he would, and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.280]   The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.160]   comforter dangling below his waist, for he boasted no greatcoat, went down a slide on
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.040]   Corn Hill at the end of a lane of boys, 20 times in honor of its being Christmas Eve,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.400]   and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt to play at Blindman's Buff.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:36.360]   Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern, and having read all
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.160]   the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's book, went home
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.480]   to bed.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.040]   He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.280]   They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building-up-a-yard, where it had so
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.560]   it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses and forgotten the way out
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   again.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.160]   It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.800]   rooms being all let out as offices.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   his hands.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.120]   The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.400]   Now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.480]   except that it was very large.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.500]   It is also a fact that Scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.140]   in that place.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.520]   Also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the City
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:58.120]   of London, even including, which is a bold word, the corporation alderman and livery.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.640]   Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.320]   his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.880]   And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.340]   his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:27.240]   process of change, not a knocker but Marley's face.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   Marley's face.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.400]   It was not an impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.200]   light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.300]   It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look, with ghostly
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.800]   spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.760]   The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air, and though the eyes were wide
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.600]   open they were perfectly motionless.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.880]   That and its livid color made it horrible, but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.780]   face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.560]   As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.060]   To say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:20.240]   to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue, but he put his hand upon
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.920]   the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in and lighted the candle.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:32.340]   He did pause with a moment's ear-resolution before he shut the door, and he did look cautiously
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:38.040]   behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.640]   pigtail sticking out into the hall.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.560]   But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.320]   on, so he said "Poo-poo" and closed it with a bang.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.280]   The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.080]   Every room above and every cask in the wine merchant's cellars below appeared to have
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.720]   a separate peal of echoes of its own.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.560]   Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.180]   He fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs, slowly too, trimming
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.800]   his candle as he went.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.360]   You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs, or
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.320]   through a bad young act of parliament, but I mean to say you might have got a hearse
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   up that staircase and taken it broadwise, with a splinter bar towards the wall and the
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.040]   door towards the balustrades, and done it easy.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.240]   There was plenty of width for that and room to spare, which is perhaps the reason why
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.320]   Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.800]   Half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.040]   suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.960]   Up Scrooge went, not carrying a button for that.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.400]   "Darkness is cheap," and Scrooge liked it.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.580]   But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.840]   He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.760]   Sitting room, bedroom, lumber room, all as they should be.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.640]   Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa, a small fire in the grate, spoon and basin
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.720]   ready, and the little saucepan of gruel, Scrooge had a cold in his head, upon the hob.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.200]   Nobody under the bed, nobody in the closet, nobody in his dressing gown, which was hanging
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.960]   up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.640]   Lumber room as usual, old fire guard, old shoes, two fish baskets, washing stand on
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   three legs, and a poker.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.120]   Quite satisfied, he closed his door and locked himself in, double locked himself in, which
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.920]   was not his custom.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.120]   Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat, put on his dressing gown and slippers
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.000]   and his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.040]   It was a very low fire indeed, nothing on such a bitter night.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:02.480]   He was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.400]   sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.000]   The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.020]   with quaint Dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.840]   There were Cain's and Abel's, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba, angelic messengers
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   descending through the air on clouds like feather beds, Abraham's, Belshazzar's,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.000]   apostles putting off to sea in butter boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.960]   And yet, that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient prophet's rod
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.040]   and swallowed up the whole.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.800]   If each smooth tile had been a blanket first, with power to shape some picture on its surface
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.560]   from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.320]   head on every one.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.920]   "Humbug!" said Scrooge and walked across the room.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   After several turns he sat down again.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.680]   As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.960]   bell that hung in the room and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with a chamber
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.720]   in the highest story of the building.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:23.120]   It was with great astonishment and with a strange, inexplicable dread that, as he looked,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.600]   he saw this bell begin to swing.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.640]   It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound, but soon it rang out loudly
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.560]   and so did every bell in the house.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.520]   This might have lasted half a minute or a minute, but it seemed an hour.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.600]   The bells ceased as they had begun, together.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:53.760]   They were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below, as if some person were dragging
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.360]   a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.480]   Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   dragging chains.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.520]   The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder on
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.640]   the floors below, then coming up the stairs, then coming straight towards his door.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.400]   "It's humbug still," said Scrooge.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.040]   "I won't believe it."
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.680]   His color changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door and
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.520]   passed into the room before his eyes.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up as though it cried, "I know him, Marley's
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.760]   ghost," and fell again.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.720]   Marley's ghost.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.240]   The same face, the very same.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.000]   Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots, the tassels on the ladder bristling
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.760]   like his pigtail, and his coat skirts, and the hair upon his head.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.900]   The chain he drew was clasped about his middle.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:02.200]   It was long and wound about him like a tail, and it was made, for Scrooge observed it closely,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:10.120]   of cash boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   His body was transparent so that Scrooge, observing him and looking through his waistcoat,
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   could see the two buttons on his coat behind.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.600]   Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   until now.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   No, nor did he believe it even now, though he looked the phantom through and through
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.680]   and saw it standing before him, though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.960]   eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound around its head and chin, which
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.560]   wrapper he had not observed before.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.240]   He was still incredulous and fought against his senses.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.600]   "How now," said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.400]   "What do you want with me?
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   Much?"
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.000]   Marley's voice, no doubt about it.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.560]   "Who are you?
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.160]   Ask me who I was."
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.840]   "Who were you then?" said Scrooge, raising his voice.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.280]   "You're particular for a shade," he was going to say to a shade, but substituted
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.520]   this is more appropriate.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.800]   "In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:13.960]   "Can you… can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   "I can."
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.520]   "Do it then."
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.880]   Scrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.600]   it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.960]   But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   to it.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.240]   "You don't believe in me," observed the ghost.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.760]   "I don't," said Scrooge.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.160]   "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?"
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.200]   "I don't know," said Scrooge.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.520]   "Why do you doubt your senses?"
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.080]   "Because," said Scrooge, "a little thing affects them.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.520]   A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.440]   of an underdone potato.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:14.760]   There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are."
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.240]   Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in his heart by any
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   means waggish then.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.760]   The truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:35.720]   keeping down his terror, for the specter's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:43.560]   To sit, staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play, Scrooge
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.520]   felt, the very deuce with him.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.960]   There was something very awful, too, in the specter's being provided with an infernal
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200]   atmosphere of its own.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.280]   Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case, for though the ghost
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:04.680]   sat perfectly motionless, its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.560]   hot vapor from an oven.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.040]   "You see this toothpick," said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.520]   just assigned and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.920]   stony gaze from himself.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.320]   "I do," replied the ghost.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.640]   "You're not looking at it," said Scrooge.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.240]   "But I see it," said the ghost, "notwithstanding."
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.720]   "Well," returned Scrooge, "I have but to swallow this and be, for the rest of my
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   days, persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.800]   Humbug, I tell you, humbug!"
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.020]   At this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.080]   appalling noise that Scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.200]   in a swoon.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.320]   But how much greater was his horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round its
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:00.200]   head as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.280]   Scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.880]   "Mercy," he said, "dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?"
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.520]   "Man of the worldly mind," replied the ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.840]   "I do," said Scrooge, "I must.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.040]   But why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me?"
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:23.280]   "It is required of every man," the ghost returned, "that the spirit within him should
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.960]   walk abroad among his fellow men and travel far and wide.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.720]   And if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:39.280]   It is doomed to wander through the world, oh, woe is me, and witness what it cannot
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.960]   share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness."
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:51.640]   Then the specter raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.280]   "You are fettered," said Scrooge, trembling.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.080]   "Tell me why."
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.280]   "I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the ghost.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   "I made it link by link and yard by yard.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.480]   I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.560]   Is its pattern strange to you?"
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.440]   Scrooge trembled more and more.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.880]   "Or would you know," pursued the ghost, "the weight and length of the strong coil
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.080]   you bear yourself?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.680]   It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas eves ago.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.280]   You have labored on it since.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.680]   It is a ponderous chain."
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.920]   Scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.640]   by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable, but he could see nothing.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.560]   "Jacob," he said imploringly, "oh, Jacob Marley, tell me more.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.120]   Speak comfort to me, Jacob."
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.960]   "I have none to give," the ghost replied.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:10.280]   "It comes from other regions," Ebenezer Scrooge, "and is conveyed by other ministers
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.200]   to other kinds of men.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.840]   Nor can I tell you what I would.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.760]   A very little more is all permitted to me.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.240]   I cannot rest.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.320]   I cannot stay.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.840]   I cannot linger anywhere.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.320]   My spirit never walked beyond our counting house, mark me.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:36.000]   In life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole, and weary
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   journeys lie before me."
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.200]   It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches'
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   pocket.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:52.240]   Pondering on what the ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes or
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.080]   getting off his knees.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.040]   "You must have been very slow about it, Jacob," Scrooge observed in a businesslike
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.640]   manner, though with humility and deference.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.000]   "Slow?" the ghost repeated.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.360]   "Seven years dead," mused Scrooge, "and traveling all the time."
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.600]   "The whole time," said the ghost.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.240]   "No rest.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.880]   No peace.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.840]   Incessant torture of remorse."
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.240]   "You travel fast?" said Scrooge.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.960]   "On the wings of the wind," replied the ghost.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:34.400]   "You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years," said Scrooge.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.440]   The ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.120]   the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.040]   for a nuisance.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.640]   "Oh, captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the phantom, "not to know that ages
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:00.520]   of incessant labor by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.740]   the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:11.040]   Not to know that any Christian spirit, working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:25.960]   Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.400]   Yet such was I. Oh, such was I."
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:35.480]   "But you were always a good man of business, Jacob," faltered Scrooge, who now began
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.080]   to apply this to himself.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.920]   "Business!" cried the ghost, wringing its hands again.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.520]   "Mankind was my business.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.600]   The common welfare was my business.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.520]   Charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence were all my business.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:02.800]   The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business."
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.920]   It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.320]   grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:18.680]   "At this time of the rolling year," the specter said, "I suffer most.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.520]   Why did I walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:30.520]   them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode?
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:36.000]   Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me?"
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.360]   Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the specter going on at this rate, and began to
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   quake exceedingly.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   "Hear me!" cried the ghost.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.280]   "My time is nearly gone!"
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.480]   "I will," said Scrooge.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.400]   "But don't be hard upon me.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   Don't be flowery, Jacob.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   Pray."
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   "How is it that I appear before you in a shape that you can see I may not tell?
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:05.880]   I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day."
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.840]   It was not an agreeable idea.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.040]   Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.400]   "That is no light part of my penance," pursued the ghost.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:25.840]   "I am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   fate.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.800]   A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer."
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.840]   "You were always a good friend to me," said Scrooge.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   "Thank ye."
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   "You will be haunted," resumed the ghost, "by three spirits."
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.560]   Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the ghost's had done.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.720]   "Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?" he demanded in a faltering voice.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.400]   "It is."
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.320]   "I think I'd rather not," said Scrooge.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.840]   "Without their visits," said the ghost, "you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.920]   Expect the first tomorrow, when the bell tolls one."
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   "Good night.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.880]   Take 'em all at once and have it over, Jacob," hinted Scrooge.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.280]   "Expect the second on the next night, at the same hour.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:24.800]   The third upon the next night, when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.880]   Look to see me no more.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.320]   And look that, for your own sake.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.080]   You remember what has passed between us."
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.640]   When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.400]   it round its head as before.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.200]   Scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.560]   the bandage.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:53.880]   He ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:00.840]   in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   The apparition walked backward from him, and at every step it took, the window raised itself
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:12.520]   a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.320]   It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.440]   When they were within two paces of each other, Marley's ghost held up its hand, warning
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.200]   him to come no nearer.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:28.320]   Scrooge stopped, not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear, for on the raising
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:35.040]   of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air, incoherent sounds of lamentation
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.480]   and regret, wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.320]   The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge and floated out
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.680]   upon the bleak, dark night.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.600]   Scrooge followed to the window, desperate in his curiosity.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.060]   He looked out.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:59.780]   The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.160]   as they went.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.400]   Every one of them wore chains like Marley's ghost.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.880]   Some few, they might be guilty governments, were linked together.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.960]   None were free.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.900]   Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:19.960]   He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:26.560]   safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.320]   with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:38.240]   The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere for good in human
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:45.680]   matters and had lost the power forever.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:52.360]   Whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.800]   But they and their spirit voices faded together, and the night became as it had been when he
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.960]   walked home.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.520]   Scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:11.440]   It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.960]   He tried to say "Humbug," but stopped at the first syllable.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:24.380]   And being from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:30.440]   of the invisible world, or the dull conversation of the ghost, or the lateness of the hour
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:39.120]   much in need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon the
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.000]   instant.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.160]   Stave II, The First of the Three Spirits
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.640]   When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that, looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.380]   the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.820]   He was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.120]   neighboring church struck the four quarters.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.020]   So he listened for the hour.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.700]   To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:21.020]   to eight, and regularly up to twelve, then stopped.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.060]   Twelve!
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.820]   It was past two when he went to bed.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820]   The clock was wrong.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.860]   An icicle must have gotten into the works.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   Twelve!
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.140]   He touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.540]   Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.580]   "Why, it is impossible," said Scrooge, "that I can have slept through a whole day
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.780]   and far into another night.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.560]   It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon."
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.060]   The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.580]   He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he could
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.060]   see anything, and could see very little then.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:02.540]   All he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.820]   was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:13.180]   would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.880]   This was a great relief, because three days after sight of this first to have exchange
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.840]   paid to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere United
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.400]   States security if there were no days to count by.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.240]   Scrooge went to bed again, and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.260]   and could make nothing of it.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.560]   The more he thought, the more perplexed he was, and the more he endeavored not to think,
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.320]   the more he thought.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.620]   Marley's ghost bothered him exceedingly.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.080]   Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.760]   mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   the same problem to be worked all through.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.920]   Was it a dream or not?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.680]   Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.760]   on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.560]   He resolved to lie awake until the hour was past, and considering that he could no more
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:14.680]   go to sleep than go to heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:21.080]   The quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:27.720]   unconsciously and missed the clock at length that broke upon his listening ear.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.280]   "Ding dong!"
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.560]   "A quarter past," said Scrooge, counting.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.000]   "Ding dong!"
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.800]   "Half past," said Scrooge.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.200]   "Ding dong!"
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.600]   "A quarter to it," said Scrooge.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.000]   "Ding dong!"
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.240]   "The hour itself," said Scrooge triumphantly, "and nothing else!"
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:56.600]   He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.480]   "One!"
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.320]   Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.600]   The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand, not the curtains at
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.280]   his feet nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.440]   The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.700]   attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them, as close
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.220]   to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:29.920]   It was a strange figure, like a child, but not so like a child as like an old man, viewed
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.200]   through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.600]   the view and being diminished to a child's proportions.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.880]   Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age, and yet
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.960]   the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:51.080]   The arms were very long and muscular, the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   strength.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.480]   Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were like those upper members bare.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   It wore a tunic of the purest white, and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.340]   of which was beautiful.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.860]   It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand, and, in singular contradiction of that
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.120]   wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.920]   But the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:23.560]   bright, clear jet of light, by which all this was visible, and which was doubtless the occasion
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:29.360]   of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.920]   its arm.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.160]   Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.040]   strangest quality.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.720]   For as its belt sparkled and glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:50.860]   light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:55.740]   Being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.080]   without a head, now a head without a body, of which dissolving parts no outline would
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.120]   be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away, and in the very wonder of this
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.800]   it would be itself again, distinct and clear as ever.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.400]   "Are you the spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?" asked Scrooge.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.280]   "I am."
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.600]   The voice was soft and gentle, singularly low as if, instead of being so close beside
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.280]   him it were at a distance.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.640]   "Who and what are you?"
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   Scrooge demanded.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.080]   "I am the ghost of Christmas Past."
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.880]   "Long past?"
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.960]   inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.440]   "No, your past."
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:42.200]   Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him, but
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:48.160]   he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap, and begged him to be covered.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   "What!" exclaimed the ghost, "would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.480]   light I give?
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.280]   Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and forced me
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:03.640]   through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow?"
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:08.520]   Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend, or any knowledge of having willfully
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.680]   bonneted the spirit at any period of his life.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.720]   He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.400]   "Your welfare," said the ghost.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.960]   Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.800]   rest would have been more conducive to that end.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.440]   The spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately, "Your reclamation,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   then.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   Take heed."
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.920]   It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.040]   "Rise and walk with me."
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.200]   It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:42.840]   adapted to pedestrian purposes, that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.680]   freezing, that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap,
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.600]   and that he had a cold upon him at that time.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.480]   The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be resisted.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:59.440]   He rose, but, finding that the spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.320]   "I am immortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.280]   "Bear but a touch of my hand, there," said the spirit, laying it upon his heart,
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.120]   "and you shall be upheld in more than this."
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.320]   As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.160]   with fields on either hand.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.760]   The city had entirely vanished.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.680]   Not a vestige of it was to be seen.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.840]   The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold winter day with
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.200]   snow upon the ground.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.440]   "Good heaven," said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked about him.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.520]   "I was bred in this place.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.320]   I was a boy here."
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.280]   The spirit gazed upon him mildly.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.920]   Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.900]   to the old man's sense of feeling.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.400]   He was conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.040]   thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long, long forgotten.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.440]   "Your lip is trembling," said the ghost.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.760]   "And what is that upon your cheek?"
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:02.160]   Scrooge muttered with an unusual "k" catching in his voice that it was a pimple, and begged
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.600]   the ghost to lead him where he would.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.480]   "You recollect the way?" inquired the spirit.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.320]   "Remember it!" cried Scrooge with fervor.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.800]   "I could walk it blindfold!"
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.080]   "Strange to have forgotten it for so many years," observed the ghost.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.000]   "Let us go on."
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.920]   They walked along the road, Scrooge recognizing every gate and post and tree, until a little
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.640]   market town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.680]   Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.600]   called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.440]   All these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broadfields were so
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.240]   full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.880]   "These are but shadows of the things that have been," said the ghost.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.440]   "They have no consciousness of us."
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.320]   The jockin' travelers came on, and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.920]   Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.500]   Why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past?
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.360]   Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other "Merry Christmas!" as
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.200]   they sparted at crossroads and byways for their several homes?
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.240]   What was Merry Christmas to Scrooge?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.040]   Out upon Merry Christmas, what good had it ever done to him?
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.440]   "The school is not quite deserted," said the ghost.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.240]   "A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:27.440]   Scrooge said he knew it, and he sobbed.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.720]   They left the high road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.440]   red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   it.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:43.040]   It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes, for the spacious offices were little used,
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.000]   their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken and their gates decayed.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.360]   Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables, and the coach houses and sheds were overrun
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.920]   with grass.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:01.280]   Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within, for entering the dreary hall and glancing
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.820]   through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold and vast.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:14.240]   There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly barrenness in the place which associated itself
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:20.480]   somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.500]   They went, the ghost and Scrooge, across the hall to a door at the back of the house.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:32.120]   It opened before them and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.440]   lines of plain deal forms and desks.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:43.360]   At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire, and Scrooge sat down upon a
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:49.520]   form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:56.220]   Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling,
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:02.140]   not a drip from the half-thawed water spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:08.020]   the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.860]   door, no, not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:18.900]   influence and gave a freer passage to his tears.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:25.660]   The spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:30.980]   Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully real and distinct to look at, stood outside
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:36.020]   the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.660]   "Why, it's Ali Baba!"
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.660]   Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.900]   "It's dear, old, honest Ali Baba!
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.400]   Yes, yes, I know!
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.060]   One Christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come for the
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.580]   first time just like that!
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.980]   Poor boy!
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.100]   And Valentine," said Scrooge, "and his wild brother Orson, there they go!
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.300]   And what's his name, who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of Damascus?
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   Don't you see him?
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.140]   And the Sultan's groom, turned upside down by the genie, there he is upon his head!
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.460]   Serve him right, I'm glad of it!
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.980]   What business had he to be married to the princess?"
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:10.860]   To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:15.300]   extraordinary voice between laughing and crying, and to see his heightened and excited face
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.580]   would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.780]   "There's the parrot!"
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:23.140]   Cried Scrooge, green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.900]   the top of his head, "There he is!
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.820]   Poor Robinson Crusoe!" he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   island.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.820]   "Poor Robin Crusoe!
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.820]   Where have you been, Robin Crusoe?"
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.260]   The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't, "It was the parrot, you know!
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.460]   There goes Friday, running for his life through the little creek!
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.460]   Hello!
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.460]   Hello!"
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.980]   Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said in
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.220]   pity before his former self, "Poor boy!" and cried again.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.660]   "I wish…"
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.900]   Scrooge muttered, putting his hands in his pocket, and looking about him after drying
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.980]   his eyes with his cuff.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.060]   "But it's too late now."
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.660]   "What is the matter?" asked the spirit.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.260]   "Nothing," said Scrooge.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.340]   "Nothing.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:10.420]   There was a boy singing a Christmas carol at my door last night.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.500]   I should like to have given him something, that's all."
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:19.460]   The ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand, saying as it did so, "Let us see another
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.660]   Christmas."
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:27.740]   Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.580]   and more dirty.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:37.180]   The panels shrunk, the windows cracked, fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.620]   naked laths were shown instead.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:43.220]   But how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than you do.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.220]   He only knew that it was quite correct, that everything had happened so, that there he
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:54.440]   was, alone, again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.
[00:59:54.440 --> 01:00:00.700]   He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:05.300]   Scrooge looked at the ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.780]   the door.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:10.320]   It opened, and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in and putting
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.780]   her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her "Dear, dear brother,
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.780]   I have come to bring you home, dear brother," said the child, clapping her tiny hands and
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.780]   bending down to laugh, "to bring you home, home, home."
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.820]   "Home, little fan?" returned the boy.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.780]   "Yes," said the child, brimful of glee, "home for good and all, home forever and ever.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.740]   Father is so much kinder than he used to be.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.140]   That home's like heaven.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.980]   He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed that I was not afraid to
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.740]   ask him once more if you might come home.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.700]   And he said, 'Yes, you should,' and sent me and a coach to bring you.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.340]   And you're to be a man!" said the child, opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.140]   But first we're to be together all the Christmas long and have the merriest time in all the
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.140]   world."
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.580]   "You are quite a woman, little fan!" exclaimed the boy.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.100]   She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head, but being too little, laughed
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.860]   again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:09.260]   Then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door, and he, nothing
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.300]   loath to go, accompanied her.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:15.900]   A terrible voice in the hall cried, "Bring down Master Scrooge's box there!"
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.700]   And in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.140]   a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.140]   with him.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.380]   He then conveyed him and his sister into the various old well of a shivering best parlor
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:34.020]   that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.700]   in the windows were waxy with cold.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:42.900]   Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake,
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.920]   and administered installments of those dainties to the young people, at the same time sending
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.140]   out a meager servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy, who answered that he thanked
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:58.520]   the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.140]   Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.820]   bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly, and getting into it drove gaily down the garden
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:12.840]   sweep, the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.540]   like spray.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:19.700]   "Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered," said the ghost, "but
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.100]   she had a large heart."
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.980]   "So she had!" cried Scrooge.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.180]   "You're right, I will not gainsay its spirit, God forbid!"
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:30.100]   "She died a woman," said the ghost, "and had, as I think, children."
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.500]   "One child," Scrooge returned.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   "True," said the ghost, "your nephew."
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:42.740]   Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, "Yes."
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.620]   Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:52.080]   thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed, where shadowy carts and
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.100]   coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:01.140]   It was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that hereto it was Christmas time
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.100]   again, but it was evening and the streets were lighted up.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.140]   The ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked Scrooge if he knew it.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.100]   "Know it," said Scrooge, "was I apprenticed here?"
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.100]   They went in.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.980]   At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.840]   had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.620]   in great excitement, "Why, it's old Fezziwig!
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.100]   Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!"
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.460]   Old Fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   of seven.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.780]   He rubbed his hands, adjusted his capacious waistcoat, laughed all over himself from his
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:39.380]   shoes to his organ of benevolence, and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.620]   voice, "Yo-ho there!
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.620]   Ebenezer!
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:43.620]   Dick!"
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:47.780]   Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.780]   apprentice.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.060]   "Dick Wilkins to be sure," said Scrooge to the ghost.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.620]   "Bless me, yes, there he is!
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.820]   He was very much attached to me, was Dick.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.420]   Poor Dick, dear, dear."
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.260]   "Yo-ho, my boys," said Fezziwig.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.580]   "No more work tonight, Christmas Eve.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.140]   Dick, Christmas, Ebenezer, let's have the shutters up," cried old Fezziwig with a sharp
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.580]   clap of his hands, "before a man can say Jack Robinson!"
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.220]   You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.940]   They charged into the street with the shutters.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.140]   "One, two, three," had 'em up in their places.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.300]   "Four, five, six," barred 'em and pinned 'em.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.620]   "Seven, eight, nine," and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.620]   racehorses.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.740]   "Hee-lee-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.300]   "Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room here.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.420]   Hee-lee-ho, Dick, drop it, Ebenezer."
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   Clear away.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.500]   There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away or couldn't have cleared away with old
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.820]   Fezziwig looking on.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.980]   It was done in a minute.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.580]   Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life forevermore.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.780]   The floor was swept in water, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire, and
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.540]   the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.340]   to see upon a winter's night.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.620]   In came a fiddler with a music book and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.420]   of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:59.260]   In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast, substantial smile.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.860]   In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.900]   In came the six young followers, whose hearts they broke.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.780]   In came all the young men and women employed in the business.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.580]   In came the housemaid with her cousin, the baker.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.820]   In came the cook with her brother's particular friend, the milkman.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.180]   In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having bored enough from
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.020]   his master, trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door, but one who was proved
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.420]   to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:30.220]   And they all came, one after another, some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.820]   awkwardly, some pushing, some pooling.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.180]   In they all came, any how and every how.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.780]   Away they all went, twenty couple at once, hands half round and back again the other
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.820]   way, down the middle and up again, round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.420]   Old top couple always turning up in the wrong place, new top couple starting off again as
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.820]   soon as they got there, all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.940]   When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940]   out, "Well done!"
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.140]   And the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.140]   purpose.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:08.380]   But scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:13.140]   dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted on the shutter, and
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.860]   he were a brand new man, resolved to beat him out of sight or perish.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.220]   There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.940]   was negus, and there was a great piece of cold roast, and there was a great piece of
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.220]   cold boiled, and there were mince pies and plenty of beer.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.980]   But the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled, when the fiddler, an
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.660]   artful dog, mine, the sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.700]   told it him, struck up Sir Roger de Coverley.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.420]   Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig, top couple too, with a good
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.220]   stiff piece of work cut out for them, three or four and twenty pair of partners, people
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.540]   who were not to be trifled with, people who would dance and had no notion of walking.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.020]   But if they had been twice as many, ah, four times, old Fezziwig would have been a match
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.460]   for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.300]   As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.140]   If that's not high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.880]   A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.260]   They shone in every part of the dance like moons.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.780]   You couldn't have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.660]   And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance, advance and retire,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.780]   both hands to your partner, bow and curtsy, corkscrew, thread the needle, and back again
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.460]   to your place, Fezziwig cut, cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.740]   came upon his feet again without a stagger.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.160]   Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.700]   hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.780]   Christmas.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.140]   When everybody had retired but the two prentices, they did the same to them, and thus the cheerful
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.740]   voices died away and the lads were left to their beds, which were under a counter in
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.480]   the back shop.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.580]   During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.940]   His heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:07.980]   He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.060]   agitation.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.900]   It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick returned from
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.940]   them, that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him,
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.220]   while the light upon its head burnt very clear.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.180]   "A small matter," said the ghost, "to make these silly folks so full of gratitude."
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.740]   "Small!" echoed Scrooge.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.140]   The spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.800]   hearts in praise of Fezziwig, and when he had done so said, "Why, is it not?
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.300]   He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money, three or four perhaps.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.540]   Is that so much that he deserves this praise?"
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.240]   "It isn't that," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.900]   his former, not his latter self.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.500]   "It isn't that, spirit.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:56.340]   He has the power to render us happy or unhappy, to make our service light or burdensome, a
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.540]   pleasure or a toil.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:05.380]   Say that his power lies in words and looks, in things so slight and insignificant that
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.420]   it is impossible to add and count them up.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   What then?
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.580]   The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:16.500]   He felt the spirit's glance and stopped.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.140]   "What is the matter?" asked the ghost.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.780]   "Nothing particular," said Scrooge.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.980]   "Something, I think?"
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:27.580]   "No," said Scrooge.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.740]   "No.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.980]   I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.620]   That's all."
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.220]   His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish, and Scrooge and
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.500]   the ghost again stood side by side in the open air.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.220]   "My time grows short," observed the spirit.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.220]   "Quick!"
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.940]   This was not addressed to Scrooge or to anyone whom he could see, but it produced an immediate
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:54.300]   effect, for again Scrooge saw himself.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.120]   He was older now, a man in the prime of life.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.620]   His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years, but it had begun to wear the
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.920]   signs of care and avarice.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:13.860]   There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.880]   had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.200]   He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a morning dress, in whose
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.020]   eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of Christmas
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   past.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.220]   "It matters little," she said softly.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.560]   "To you, very little.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.380]   Your idol has displaced me, and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.200]   I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve."
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.880]   "What idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.760]   "A golden one."
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.240]   "This is the even-handed dealing of the world," he said.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.720]   "There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty, and there is nothing it professes
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.640]   to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth."
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.160]   "You fear the world too much," she answered gently.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.960]   "All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   reproach.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:22.600]   I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off, one by one, until the master-passion, gain,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.960]   engrosses you, have I not?"
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.480]   "What then?" he retorted.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.040]   "Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then?
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.720]   I am not changed towards you."
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.720]   She shook her head.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.480]   "Am I?"
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.960]   "Your contract is an old one.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:44.180]   It was made when we were both poor, and content to be so, until in good season we could improve
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.120]   our worldly fortune by our patient industry.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.080]   You are changed.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.280]   When it was made, you were another man."
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.160]   "I was a boy," he said impatiently.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.560]   "Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are," she returned.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.160]   "I am."
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.840]   "That which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.720]   we are two.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.580]   How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.560]   It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you."
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.840]   "Have I ever sought release?"
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.040]   "In words, no.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040]   Never."
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040]   "In what, then?"
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:35.340]   "In a changed nature, in an altered spirit, in another atmosphere of life, another hope
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:41.900]   as its great end, in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:48.240]   If this had never been between us," said the girl, looking mildly but with steadiness upon
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.120]   him, "tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now?"
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.960]   "Ah, no."
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.160]   He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   But he said with a struggle, "You think not."
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.640]   "I would gladly think otherwise if I could," she answered.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.840]   "Heaven knows!
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.760]   When I have learned a truth like this I know how strong and irresistible it must be.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:18.160]   But if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:26.880]   dowerless girl, you who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by gain, or choosing
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.240]   her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.560]   I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow?
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:46.160]   I do, and I release you, with a full heart, for the love of him you once were."
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.880]   She was about to speak, but with her head turned away from him she resumed, "You may,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:59.120]   the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will, have pain in this, a very, very
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:06.960]   brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream, from
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.560]   which it happened well that you awoke.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.200]   May you be happy in the life you have chosen."
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.880]   She left him and they parted.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.760]   "Spirit," said Scrooge, "show me no more, conduct me home, why do you delight
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.000]   to torture me?"
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.720]   "One shadow more," exclaimed the ghost.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.960]   "No more!" cried Scrooge, "no more, I don't wish to see it, show me no more!"
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.080]   But the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   next.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:43.160]   They were in another scene and place, a room not very large or handsome, but full of comfort,
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.160]   near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:56.160]   it was the same until he saw her, now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.600]   The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there than Scrooge
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.500]   in his agitated state of mind could count, and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:13.840]   they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.560]   like forty.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:21.000]   The consequences were uproarious beyond belief, but no one seemed to care, on the contrary,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.720]   the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much, and the latter, soon
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.300]   beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.580]   What would I not have given to be one of them?
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.720]   Though I never could have been so rude, no, no, I wouldn't for the wealth of all the
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.560]   world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down, and for the precious little shoe
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.460]   I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul, to save my life.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:51.240]   As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.160]   it, I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.940]   come straight again, and yet I should have dearly liked Ione to have touched her lips,
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:06.000]   to have questioned her that she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.740]   of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.460]   which would be a keepsake beyond price.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:20.960]   In short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.680]   and yet to have been man enough to know its value.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.900]   But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she,
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:32.980]   with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne towards it, the center of a flushed
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.820]   and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.980]   laden with Christmas toys and presents.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.220]   Then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenseless
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:51.540]   porter, the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:56.740]   paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pummel his back and
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:01.540]   kick his legs in irrepressible affection, the shouts of wonder and delight with which
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.380]   the development of every package was received, the terrible announcement that the baby had
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.340]   been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth and was more than
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.180]   suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter, the immense
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:22.380]   relief of finding this a false alarm, the joy and gratitude and ecstasy, they are all
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.660]   indescribable alike.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:29.140]   It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlor and
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:36.220]   by one stare at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed, and so subsided.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:42.300]   And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:48.260]   his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside,
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.740]   and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:18:00.860]   have called him father, and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life, his sight
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.860]   grew very dim indeed.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:06.980]   "Belle," said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, "I saw an old friend of
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   yours this afternoon."
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.780]   "Who was it?"
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]   "Guess."
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:11.780]   "How can I?
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:15.140]   Tut, don't I know?" she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140]   "Mr. Scrooge."
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.660]   "Mr. Scrooge it was.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.980]   I passed his office window, and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside, I
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.860]   could scarcely help seeing him.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:29.780]   His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear, and there he sat alone, quite alone
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.940]   in the world, I do believe."
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:36.780]   "Spirit," said Scrooge in a broken voice, "remove me from this place."
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:43.020]   "I told you these were shadows of the things that have been," said the ghost, "that
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.100]   they are what they are.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.260]   Do not blame me."
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.540]   "Remove me!"
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.540]   Scrooge exclaimed.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.540]   "I cannot bear it!"
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:51.020]   The light of the candle turned upon the ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:56.300]   face in which, in some strange way, there were fragments of all the faces it had shown
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.780]   him, wrestled with it, "Leave me!
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:18:59.780]   Take me back!
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.140]   Haunt me no longer!"
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.580]   In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle, in which the ghost, with no visible resistance
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:10.500]   on its own part, was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.820]   light was burning high and bright, and dimly connecting that with its influence over him,
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:21.660]   he seized the extinguisher cap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:26.420]   The spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form, but though
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:31.340]   Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light which streamed
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:35.020]   from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:41.060]   He was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness, and further
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.980]   of being in his own bedroom.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:49.180]   He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:56.820]   to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:00.980]   Stave 3, the second of the three spirits.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:06.660]   Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:11.260]   together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   one.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:16.500]   He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.260]   purpose of holding a conference with a second messenger dispatched to him through Jacob
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.220]   Marley's intervention.
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:29.140]   But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:35.020]   this new specter would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:40.420]   down again established a sharp lookout all round the bed, for he wished to challenge
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.940]   the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.020]   made nervous.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:52.300]   Gentlemen of the free and easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.840]   or two and being usually equal to the time of day, express the wide range of their capacity
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.820]   for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch and toss to manslaughter,
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:09.360]   between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.900]   of subjects.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:15.700]   Without venturing for Scrooge quite as heartily as this, I don't mind calling on you to
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.080]   believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:26.700]   between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:34.300]   Now being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.540]   And consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared, he was taken with a
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.780]   violent fit of trembling.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:48.060]   Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:52.940]   All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and center of a blaze of ruddy light
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:58.180]   which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour in which being only light was more
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:04.540]   alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at and
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:08.780]   was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.300]   spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.820]   At last, however, he began to think, as you or I would have thought at first, for it is
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.340]   always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.540]   would unquestionably have done it too.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.620]   At last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:34.700]   be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:39.220]   This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.560]   to the door.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.260]   The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name and
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.620]   bade him enter.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.420]   He obeyed.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:51.020]   It was his own room.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:55.100]   There was no doubt about that, but it had undergone a surprising transformation.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:01.420]   The walls and ceilings were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect grove, from
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:05.120]   every part of which bright, gleaming berries glistened.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:10.720]   The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.460]   little mirrors had been scattered there, and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimneys
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:20.860]   as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's,
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.580]   or for many and many a winter season gone.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:31.940]   Leaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:38.380]   great joints of meat, sucking pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince pies, plum puddings, barrels
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:45.000]   of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.220]   twelfth cakes, and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   steam.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:59.260]   In easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant, glorious to see, who bore a glowing
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:04.740]   torch in shape not unlike plenty's horn, and held it up high up to shed its light on
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.100]   Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.140]   "Come in!" exclaimed the ghost.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.860]   "Come in and know me better, man!"
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.780]   Scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before the spirit.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.980]   He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been, and though the spirit's eyes were clear and
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:22.820]   kind, he did not like to meet them.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.340]   "I am the ghost of Christmas present," said the spirit.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.380]   "Look upon me!"
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.140]   Scrooge reverently did so.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:36.500]   It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur.
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.420]   This garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare, as if
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:45.500]   disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.820]   Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare, and on a
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:55.940]   head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:02.940]   Its dark brown curls were long and free, free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:07.860]   open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanor, and its joyful air.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.260]   Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard, but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.980]   was eaten up with rust.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:19.100]   "You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed the spirit.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.100]   "Never!"
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.500]   Scrooge made the answer to it.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:26.180]   "Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family, meaning, for I am very
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:30.340]   young, my elder brothers born in these later years," pursued the phantom.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.660]   "I don't think I have," said Scrooge.
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.300]   "I'm afraid I have not.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.020]   Have you had many brothers, spirit?"
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:39.020]   "More than 1,800," said the ghost.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:43.340]   "A tremendous family to provide for," muttered Scrooge.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.420]   The ghost of Christmas present rose.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.500]   "Spirit," said Scrooge submissively.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.460]   "Conduct me where you will.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.780]   I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.780]   Tonight, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it."
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.820]   "Touch my robe!"
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.260]   Scrooge did as he was told and held it fast.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:08.740]   Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages,
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:13.020]   oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch all vanished instantly.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.700]   So did the room, the fire, the ready glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.660]   streets on Christmas morning where, for the weather was severe, the people made a rough
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:26.420]   but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.180]   front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:34.800]   to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.020]   little snowstorms.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:42.500]   The house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:47.540]   white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground, which last
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:53.360]   deposit had been plowed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and wagons, furrows
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.100]   that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:03.980]   off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:10.940]   The sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed,
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:17.020]   half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:21.800]   chimneys in Great Britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.760]   dear heart's content.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.660]   There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:35.940]   abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavored to diffuse
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:41.300]   in vain, for the people who were shoveling away on the housetops were jovial and full
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:46.460]   of glee, calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.500]   snowball, better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest, laughing heartily if it
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.740]   went right and not less heartily if it went wrong.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.880]   The poultry shops were still half open and the fruterers were radiant in their glory.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.860]   There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:09.740]   jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.700]   apoplectic opulence.
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:16.860]   There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:22.700]   their growth like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:27.600]   girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.640]   There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.660]   There were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeeper's benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.620]   that people's mouths might water gratis as they passed.
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:47.100]   There were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling in their fragrance ancient walks
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.920]   among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle-deep through withered leaves.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.860]   There were Norfolk biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   lemons and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.340]   to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:11.880]   The very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.820]   of a dull and stagnant-blooded race appeared to know that there was something going on
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:23.060]   and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:24.060]   excitement.
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:31.180]   The grocers, oh, the grocers, nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one, but
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.820]   through those gaps such glimpses.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:38.100]   It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:42.740]   the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:47.740]   down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:53.140]   to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:58.460]   light, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:03.380]   candied fruit so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers on feel
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.580]   faint and subsequently bilious.
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:12.500]   Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:17.020]   tartness from their highly decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:21.740]   its Christmas dress, but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:26.380]   promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.620]   baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:35.820]   them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humor possible, while the grocer
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:40.100]   and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:45.980]   their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.460]   for Christmas dolls to peck at it if they chose.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:54.940]   But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and away they came,
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:59.380]   flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces, and at
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:05.820]   the same time there emerged from scores of by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings innumerable
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.140]   people carrying their dinners to the baker's shops.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:13.420]   The sight of these poor revelers appeared to interest the spirit very much, for he stood
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:18.260]   with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.940]   passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:26.500]   And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there were angry words
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:31.160]   between some dinner carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:35.600]   them from it, and their good humor was restored directly, for they said it was a shame to
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.620]   quarrel upon Christmas Day.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:38.980]   And so it was.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.420]   God love it, so it was.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:47.220]   In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up, and yet there was a genial shadowing
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:52.260]   forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:58.860]   wet above each baker's oven, where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:04.540]   "Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle from your torch?" asked Scrooge.
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.940]   "There is.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.940]   My own."
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:10.860]   "Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?" asked Scrooge.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.180]   "To any kindly given.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.580]   To a poor one most."
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.140]   "Why, to a poor one most?"
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.300]   asked Scrooge.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.180]   "Because it needs it most."
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:27.580]   "Spirit," said Scrooge after a moment's thought, "I wonder you, of all the beings
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:31.660]   in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.660]   innocent enjoyment."
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:38.220]   "I," cried the spirit, "you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:43.220]   day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all," said Scrooge.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.900]   "Wouldn't you?"
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:50.860]   "I," cried the spirit, "you seek to close these places on the seventh day," said Scrooge,
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.100]   "and it comes to the same thing."
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:57.780]   "I seek," exclaimed the spirit, "forgive me if I am wrong.
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.580]   It has been done in your name or at least in that of your family," said Scrooge.
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:06.520]   "There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the spirit, "who lay claim to know
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:14.780]   us and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:20.460]   in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they have never
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.460]   lived.
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:26.660]   Remember that and charge their doings on themselves, not us."
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.740]   Scrooge promised that he would, and they went on, invisible as they had been before into
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.860]   the suburbs of the town.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:38.240]   It was a remarkable quality of the ghost, which Scrooge had observed at the baker's,
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.540]   that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:47.700]   ease, and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:52.500]   creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.780]   And perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:02.280]   it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men that led
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.660]   him straight to Scrooge's clerks.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:09.660]   For there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe, and on the threshold
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.820]   of the door the spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.760]   sprinkling of his torch.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.100]   Think of that.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.780]   Bob had but fifteen, Bob, a week for himself.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.720]   He pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name, and yet the ghost of
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.960]   Christmas present blessed his four-roomed house.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:35.700]   Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown,
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:39.900]   but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for six pence.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.820]   And she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:49.660]   in ribbons, while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:54.140]   getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar, Bob's private property conferred
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:59.260]   upon his son and heir in honor of the day, into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:04.640]   gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.860]   And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:14.260]   bakers they had smelt the goose and known it for their own, and basking in luxurious
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:20.060]   thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:24.660]   Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he, not proud, although his collars nearly choked
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:29.780]   him, blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.700]   lid, to be let out and peeled.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.380]   "What has ever got your precious father, then?" said Mrs. Cratchit.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.220]   "And your brother, Tiny Tim.
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:40.340]   And Martha warn't as late last Christmas day by half an hour."
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.460]   "Here's Martha, mother," said a girl, appearing as she spoke.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.900]   "Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two young Cratchits.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.900]   "Hurrah!
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.740]   There is such a goose, Martha!"
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.820]   "Why, bless your heart alive, my dear!
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:55.220]   How late you are!" said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.900]   and bonnet for her with officious zeal.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:02.340]   "We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the girl, "and had to clear away
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.580]   this morning, mother."
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:06.380]   "Well, never mind, so long as you're come," said Mrs. Cratchit.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.140]   "Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140]   Lord bless ye!"
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.860]   "No, no, there's father coming!" cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.860]   once.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   "Hide, Martha, hide!"
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.740]   So Martha hid herself, and in came Little Bob, the father, with at least three feet
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:24.420]   of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him, and his threadbare clothes
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:29.100]   darned up and brushed to look seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:34.860]   Alas, for Tiny Tim he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.500]   "Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.580]   "Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.780]   "Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits, for he had been Tim's
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.980]   blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.660]   "Not coming upon Christmas Day!"
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:55.060]   Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in jokes, so she came out
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:00.020]   prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:03.660]   hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash house, that he might hear the pudding
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.820]   singing in the copper.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:09.860]   "And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:13.140]   credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart's content.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:15.820]   "As good as gold," said Bob, "and better.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:20.100]   Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.100]   ever heard.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.460]   He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:29.260]   a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.220]   beggars walk and blind men see."
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:37.620]   Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.840]   Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.740]   His act of little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:51.380]   word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire, and while
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:57.740]   Bob, turning up his cuffs, as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby,
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:03.300]   compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round,
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.460]   and put it on the hob to simmer.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:09.900]   Master Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.060]   they soon returned in high procession.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:18.300]   Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose, the rarest of all birds, a feathered
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:23.180]   phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course, and in truth it was something very
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.860]   like it in that house.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:29.700]   Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy, ready beforehand in a little saucepan, hissing hot.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.700]   Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.020]   Miss Belinda sweetened up the applesauce.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.900]   Martha dusted the hot plates.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.980]   Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:44.800]   The two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.780]   upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:52.380]   before their turn came to be helped.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.260]   At last the dishes were set on and grace was said.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:01.420]   It was succeeded by a breathless pause as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.900]   carving knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:10.400]   But when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.060]   of delight arose all around the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits,
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:21.020]   beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried, "Hurrah!"
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.100]   There never was such a goose.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.500]   Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:32.460]   Its tenderness and flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:36.860]   Eeked out by applesauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:37.860]   indeed.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.580]   As Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight, surveying one small atom of a bone upon the
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.100]   dish, "They hadn't ate it all at last."
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.780]   Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular were steeped in sage
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.180]   and onion to the eyebrows.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.840]   But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone,
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.900]   too nervous to bear witness, to take the pudding up and bring it in.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.620]   Suppose it should not be done enough.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.460]   Suppose it should break in turning out.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.740]   Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and stolen it while they
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:11.140]   were merry with the goose, a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.300]   All sorts of horrors were supposed.
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300]   "Ello!"
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.660]   A great deal of steam.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:16.940]   The pudding was out of the copper.
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.500]   A smell like a washing day.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.620]   That was the cloth.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:23.660]   A smell like an eating house and the pastry cooks next door to each other with a laundress
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.220]   next door to that.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.360]   That was the pudding.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.180]   In half a minute, Mrs. Cratchit entered, flushed but smiling proudly, with the pudding, like
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:38.700]   a speckled cannonball, so hard and firm, blazing in half a quarter of ignited brandy and bedite
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:41.300]   with Christmas holly stuck into the top.
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:45.500]   "Oh, what a wonderful pudding," Bob Cratchit said, and calmly, too, that he regarded it
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:50.460]   as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:54.540]   Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:57.540]   her doubts about the quantity of flour.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:01.940]   Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.980]   pudding for a large family.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:06.700]   It would have been flat heresy to do so.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:10.500]   Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:14.220]   At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:18.580]   made up, the compound and the jug being tasted and considered perfect.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:22.780]   Apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire.
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:27.100]   Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle,
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.900]   meaning half a one, and above Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass, two
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.020]   tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:40.100]   These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done,
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:44.820]   and Bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:46.300]   noisily.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.180]   Then Bob proposed, "A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.780]   God bless us," which all the family re-echoed.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:57.980]   "God bless us, everyone," said Tiny Tim, the last of all.
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:01.540]   He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:05.660]   Bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:08.980]   by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:13.660]   "Spirit," said Scrooge with an interest he had never felt before, "tell me if Tiny
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:14.660]   Tim will live."
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:19.340]   "I see a vacant seat," replied the ghost, "in the poor chimney corner and a crutch
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.860]   without an owner carefully preserved.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.820]   If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die."
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:28.380]   "No, no," said Scrooge.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:30.980]   "Oh, no, kind spirit, say he will be spared."
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:37.860]   "If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none other of my race," returned
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:40.340]   the ghost, "will find him here.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:41.340]   What then?
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:47.140]   If he be like to die, he had better do it and decrease the surplus population."
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.140]   Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.820]   penitence and grief.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:58.620]   "Man," said the ghost, "if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:03.500]   Kent until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is.
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:07.540]   Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die?
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:12.180]   It may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.740]   millions like this poor man's child.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:20.740]   Oh God, to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.980]   in the dust."
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:31.060]   Scrooge bent before the ghost's rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground, but
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:34.660]   he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:40.900]   "Mr. Scrooge," said Bob, "I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the feast."
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:44.580]   "The founder of the feast indeed," cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.220]   "I wish I had him here.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.000]   I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and I hope he'd have a good appetite
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000]   for it."
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.020]   "My dear," said Bob, "the children, Christmas Day."
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:59.340]   "It should be Christmas Day, I'm sure," said she, "on which one drinks the health
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:04.560]   of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.940]   You know he is, Robert.
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:08.100]   Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow."
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:14.260]   "My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas Day."
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:19.800]   "I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's," said Mrs. Cratchit, "not
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.800]   for his.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.800]   Long life to him.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.800]   A merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.800]   He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt."
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.300]   The children drank the toast after her.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:34.760]   It was the first of their proceedings, which had no heartiness.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:40.640]   Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care two pence for it.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.820]   Scrooge was the ogre of the family.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:49.000]   The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.780]   full five minutes.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.720]   After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.400]   of Scrooge the baleful being done with.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:04.480]   Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:07.960]   in if obtained full five and six pence weekly.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.920]   The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter as being a man of business,
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:18.040]   and Peter himself looking thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.760]   were deliberating what particular investments he should favor when he came into the receipt
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:24.760]   of that bewildering income.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.800]   Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work she had to
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:34.760]   do and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed tomorrow morning
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.400]   for a good long rest, tomorrow being a holiday she passed at home.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.760]   Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord was much
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.680]   about as tall as Peter, at which Peter pulled up his collar so high that you couldn't have
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.880]   seen his head if you had been there.
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.280]   All this time the chestnuts in the jug went round and round, and by and by they had a
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.160]   song about a lost child traveling in the snow from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.820]   voice and sang it very well indeed.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:04.960]   There was nothing of high mark in this.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.680]   They were not a handsome family.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.240]   They were not well-dressed.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:11.200]   Their shoes were far from being waterproof.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.960]   Their clothes were scanty.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.340]   And Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's.
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:23.440]   But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.080]   And when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit's
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:33.760]   torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim until the
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.120]   last.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.760]   By this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily, and as Scrooge and the spirit
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:42.620]   went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlors, and
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:45.560]   all sorts of rooms was wonderful.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:51.140]   Here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cozy dinner, with hot plates baking
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:56.020]   through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.800]   cold and darkness.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.480]   There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters,
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.680]   brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.560]   Here again were shadows on the window blind of guests assembling, and there a group of
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.640]   handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:18.480]   off to some near neighbor's house, where, "Woe upon the single man who saw them enter!"
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:21.840]   Artful witches, well they knew it, in a glow.
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.420]   But if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings,
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.000]   you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.400]   instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires half chimney high.
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.920]   Blessings on it, how the ghost exulted!
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.480]   How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.400]   with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.000]   The very lamplighter who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000]   who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the spirit passed, though
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.480]   little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.400]   And now, without a word of warning from the ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.080]   moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:15.520]   place of giants, and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so but for the
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:22.720]   frost that held it prisoner, and nothing grew but moss and firs, and coarse-rank grass.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:27.720]   Down in the west, the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:35.320]   desolation for an instant like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.520]   lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.320]   "What place is this?" asked Scrooge.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.800]   "A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth," returned the spirit.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.760]   "But they know me, see?"
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:55.200]   A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.160]   Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.560]   a glowing fire.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.800]   An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children's children, and another
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.160]   generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.480]   The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste,
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.400]   was singing them a Christmas song.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.940]   It had been a very old song when he was a boy, and from time to time they all joined
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.360]   in the chorus.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:25.200]   So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud, and so
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.440]   surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:34.480]   A spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor,
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.400]   sped wither, not to see, to see.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:43.320]   To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:47.680]   rocks behind them, and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.640]   roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.040]   the earth.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.720]   Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:04.180]   waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:08.920]   Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base, and storm-birds, born of the wind, one might
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.400]   suppose, as seaweed of the water, rose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.600]   But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that, through the loophole
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.760]   in the thick stone wall, shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.760]   Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:31.720]   Merry Christmas in their can of grog, and one of them, the elder too, with his face
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.640]   all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figurehead of an old ship might be,
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.440]   struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:46.320]   Then the ghosts sped on, above the black and heaving sea, on, on, until being far away,
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.420]   as he told Scrooge, from any shore they lighted on a ship.
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:53.640]   They stood beside the helmsmen at the wheel, the lookout and the bow, the officers who
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:58.660]   had the watch, dark, ghostly figures in their several stations, but every man among them
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:03.480]   hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:08.860]   companion of some bygone Christmas day, with homeward hopes belonging to it.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:14.720]   And every man on board, walking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:20.560]   on that day than on any day in the year, and had shared to some extent in its festivities,
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.940]   and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they were delighted
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.940]   to remember him.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:31.980]   It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:37.020]   what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss,
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:40.380]   whose depths were secrets as profound as death.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:46.100]   It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:51.620]   It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognize it as his own nephew's, and
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:58.100]   to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the spirit standing smiling by
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:02.940]   his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability.
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:07.060]   "Ha ha ha ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.060]   "Ha ha ha ha!
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:11.780]   If you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blessed in a laugh than
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:16.700]   Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.220]   Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:26.300]   It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:33.460]   disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:35.100]   and good humor.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.460]   When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way, holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:45.340]   his face into the most extravagant contortions, Scrooge's niece by marriage laughed as heartily
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:50.500]   as he, and their assembled friends, being not a bit behind hand, roared out lustily.
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:53.420]   "Ha ha ha ha!
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:57.540]   He said that Christmas was a humbug as I live!" cried Scrooge's nephew.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.540]   "He believed it too!"
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:02.780]   "More shame for him, Fred," said Scrooge's niece indignantly.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:03.940]   "Bless those women!
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.300]   They never do anything by halves.
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.180]   They are always in earnest."
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.380]   She was very pretty, exceedingly pretty, with a dimpled, surprised-looking capital face,
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:15.660]   a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissed, as no doubt it was, all kinds of good
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:20.340]   little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed, and the sunniest
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:24.100]   pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:27.540]   Altogether she was what you would have called provoking.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:30.020]   You know, but satisfactory too.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.580]   Oh, perfectly satisfactory.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:34.660]   "He's a comical old fellow," said Scrooge's nephew.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:37.380]   "That's the truth, and not so pleasant as he might be.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:42.220]   However, his offenses carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him."
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:46.060]   "I am sure he is very rich, Fred," hinted Scrooge's niece.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:48.460]   "At least you always tell me so."
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:51.340]   "What of that, my dear?" said Scrooge's nephew.
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:53.820]   "His wealth is of no use to him.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.660]   He don't do any good with it.
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:57.620]   He don't make himself comfortable with it.
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:04.380]   He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking that he's ever going to benefit us with it."
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:08.380]   "I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:12.340]   Scrooge's niece's sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion.
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.940]   "Oh, I have," said Scrooge's nephew.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.540]   "I'm sorry for him.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:19.020]   I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.300]   Who suffers by his ill whims?
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:23.100]   Himself, always.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:27.860]   Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.580]   What's the consequences?
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:31.540]   He don't lose much of a dinner."
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:36.060]   "Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted Scrooge's niece.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:39.900]   Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges,
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:43.300]   because they had just had dinner, and with the dessert upon the table were clustered
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.940]   round the fire by lamplight.
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:48.700]   "Well, I'm very glad to hear it," said Scrooge's nephew, "because I haven't
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:50.860]   great faith in these young housekeepers.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:53.420]   What do you say, Topper?"
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:57.100]   Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:01.620]   that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:06.900]   subject, whereat Scrooge's niece's sister, the plump one with the lace tucker, not the
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:08.660]   one with the roses, blushed.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:12.220]   "Do go on, Fred," said Scrooge's niece, clasping her hands.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.180]   "He never finishes what he begins to say.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.740]   He is such a ridiculous fellow."
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.820]   Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:26.420]   off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar, his example was
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.740]   unanimously followed.
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:32.140]   "I was only going to say," said Scrooge's nephew, "that the consequences of his taking
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:38.500]   a dislike to us and not making merry with us is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:41.100]   moments, which could do him no harm.
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:46.140]   I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:49.220]   his moldy old office or his dusty chambers.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:55.660]   I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:56:00.300]   He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:07.580]   I defy him if he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying, 'Uncle
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.860]   Scrooge, how are you?'
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:14.020]   If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that's something,
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:16.500]   and I think I shook him yesterday."
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:21.460]   It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge, but being thoroughly
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:27.260]   good-natured and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate,
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:31.900]   he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:35.620]   After tea they had some music, for they were a musical family and knew what they were about
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:40.540]   when they sung a glee or catch, I can assure you, especially Topper, who could growl away
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:44.820]   in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:46.540]   in the face over it.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:49.940]   Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:54.100]   air, a mere nothing, you might learn to whistle it in two minutes, which had been familiar
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.420]   to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding school as he had been reminded by
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:00.660]   the ghost of Christmas past.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:05.820]   When this strain of music sounded, all the things that ghost had shown him came upon
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.260]   his mind.
[01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:12.820]   He softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:17.420]   ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:24.160]   hands without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.780]   But they didn't devote the whole evening to music.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:30.660]   After a while, they played at forfeits, for it is good to be children sometimes and never
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:34.420]   better than at Christmas, when its mighty founder was a child himself.
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:35.420]   Stop!
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.340]   There was first a game at blind man's buff.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.760]   Of course there was.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.000]   And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.340]   My opinion is that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew and that the ghost
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.160]   of Christmas present knew it.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.760]   The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.420]   of human nature, knocking down the fire irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:01.140]   the piano, smothering himself among the curtains.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.720]   Wherever she went, there went he.
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.620]   He always knew where the plump sister was.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.460]   He wouldn't catch anybody else.
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:12.420]   If you had fallen up against him, as some of them did, on purpose, he would have made
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:16.240]   a feint of endeavoring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:20.380]   and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.040]   She often cried out that it wasn't fair and it really was not.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:28.320]   But when at last he caught her, when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:33.760]   flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape, then his conduct
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:36.160]   was the most execrable.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:40.480]   For his pretending not to know her, his pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.680]   and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:48.840]   and a certain chain about her neck was vile, monstrous.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:53.120]   No doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in office, they were
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.920]   so very confidential together behind the curtains.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:00.580]   Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's buff party but was made comfortable
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:05.340]   with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and Scrooge were close
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:06.540]   behind her.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:10.860]   But she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.100]   the alphabet.
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:16.740]   Likewise at the game of how, when, and where, she was very great and to the secret joy of
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:21.300]   Scrooge's nephew beat her sisters hollow, though they were sharp girls too, as Topper
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:22.380]   could have told you.
[01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:26.460]   There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played and so
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:31.060]   did Scrooge, for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:35.500]   his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:40.100]   and very often guessed quite right too, for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel warranted
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:44.220]   not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in his head to
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:45.220]   be.
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:49.340]   The ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:53.940]   favor that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed.
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.860]   But this, the spirit said, could not be done.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.140]   "Here is a new game," said Scrooge.
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:01.580]   "One half hour, spirit, only one!"
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:06.080]   It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something and the rest
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:11.740]   must find out what, he only answering to their questions, yes or no, as the case was.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:15.460]   The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:20.620]   thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:24.260]   animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in London and
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.660]   walked about the streets and wasn't made a show of and wasn't led by anybody and didn't
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:31.900]   live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:36.580]   a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear.
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:41.180]   At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:45.940]   and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp.
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:50.540]   At last, the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out, "I found it out!
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:51.660]   I know what it is, Fred!
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.660]   I know what it is!"
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.220]   "What is it?" cried Fred.
[02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:57.540]   "It's your Uncle Scrooge!"
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:59.260]   Which it certainly was.
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:03.700]   Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to "Is it a
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:08.060]   bear?" ought to have been "yes" inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient
[02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:13.020]   to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.020]   way.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:19.100]   "He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said Fred, "and it would be
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.900]   ungrateful not to drink his health.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:28.140]   Here is a glass of mulled wine, ready to our hand at the moment, and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'"
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:30.820]   "Well, Uncle Scrooge!" they cried.
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:35.620]   "A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is," said Scrooge's
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:36.620]   nephew.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:40.940]   "He didn't take it from me, but may he have it nevertheless.
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:43.540]   Uncle Scrooge!"
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.740]   Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:53.820]   pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an audible speech if the
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:56.020]   ghost had given him time.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:02:00.140]   But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew, and
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:03.100]   he and the spirit were again upon their travels.
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:08.340]   Such they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:09.340]   end.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:13.380]   The spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful, on foreign lands, and they
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.700]   were close at home, by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope, by
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:24.020]   poverty, and it was rich, in almshouse, hospital, and jail, in miseries every refuge, where
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:28.780]   vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:34.140]   out, he left his blessing and taught Scrooge his precepts.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.700]   It was a long night, if it were only a night, but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:43.940]   the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:49.460]   It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the ghost grew
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:52.860]   older, clearly older.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:56.420]   Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children's
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:03:01.020]   twelfth night party, when, looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place,
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.140]   he noticed that its hair was gray.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:06.700]   "Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.
[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:10.460]   "My life upon this globe is very brief," replied the ghost.
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:11.460]   "It ends tonight."
[02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:12.460]   "Tonight!" cried Scrooge.
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:13.460]   "Tonight at midnight.
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.460]   Hark!
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:17.100]   The time is drawing near."
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:20.620]   The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:25.780]   "Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask," said Scrooge, looking intently at
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:26.780]   the spirit's robe.
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:31.460]   "But I see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts.
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:33.540]   Is it a foot or a claw?"
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:38.180]   "It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was the spirit's sorrowful
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.180]   reply.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:40.620]   "Look here!"
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:49.100]   From the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject, frightful, hideous,
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.580]   miserable.
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:54.460]   They knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment.
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:56.300]   "Oh man, look here!
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:59.340]   Look, look, down here!" exclaimed the ghost.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:06.100]   They were a boy and a girl, yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but prostrate too
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.660]   in their humility.
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:11.580]   Where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched them with its freshest
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:17.920]   tints, a stale and shriveled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:19.500]   them into shreds.
[02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:25.180]   Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked and glared out menacing.
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:31.020]   No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the mysteries
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:36.060]   of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.740]   Scrooge started back, appalled, having them shown to him in this way.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.460]   He tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves rather than be
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:48.580]   parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:50.780]   "Spirit, are they yours?"
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:51.940]   Scrooge could say no more.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:54.900]   "They are man's," said the spirit, looking down upon them.
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.900]   "And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.
[02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.580]   This boy is ignorance.
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:01.380]   This girl is want.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:06.200]   Beware them both and all of their degree, but most of all, beware this boy, for on his
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:11.700]   brow I see that written which is doom, unless the writing be erased.
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:15.340]   Deny it!" cried the spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.380]   "Slander those who tell it ye.
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:22.380]   Forget it for your factious purposes and make it worse, and bide the end."
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:25.340]   "Have they no refuge or resource?" cried Scrooge.
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:29.380]   "Are there no prisons?" said the spirit, turning on him for the last time with his
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:30.380]   own words.
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:32.380]   "Are there no workhouses?"
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:35.340]   The bell struck twelve.
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:37.900]   Scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not.
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:45.180]   As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:53.140]   up his eyes, beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:06:01.660]   ground, towards him.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.380]   Stave IV.
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.500]   The Last of the Spirits
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:12.620]   The phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:18.500]   When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee, for in the very air through which
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:23.460]   this spirit moved, it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:29.660]   It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:34.540]   left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:39.180]   But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:42.400]   it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:47.860]   He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:51.680]   presence filled him with a solemn dread.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.700]   He knew no more, for the spirit neither spoke nor moved.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:03.700]   "I am in the presence of the ghost of Christmas yet to come," said Scrooge.
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:09.180]   The spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:13.940]   "You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:15.780]   in the time before us," Scrooge pursued.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:17.860]   "Is that so, spirit?"
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:24.020]   The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the spirit
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:27.460]   had inclined its head.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:30.420]   That was the only answer he received.
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:35.680]   Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:40.460]   that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:41.740]   to follow it.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:46.460]   The spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:48.260]   But Scrooge was all the worse for this.
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:53.180]   It thrilled him with a vague, uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:58.620]   were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:05.640]   utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:07.200]   "Ghost of the future!" he exclaimed.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:11.160]   "I fear you more than any specter I have seen, but as I know your purpose is to do
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.960]   me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:19.100]   you company and do it with a thankful heart.
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:22.440]   Will you not speak to me?"
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:24.440]   It gave him no reply.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.840]   The hand was pointed straight before them.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.000]   "Lead on," said Scrooge.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000]   "Lead on!
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.840]   The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know.
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.520]   Lead on, spirit!"
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.480]   The phantom moved away as it had come towards him.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:45.680]   Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:46.940]   him along.
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:50.900]   They scarcely seemed to enter the city, for the city rather seemed to spring up about
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:53.960]   them and encompass them of its own act.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:57.980]   But there they were, in the heart of it, on change, amongst the merchants, who hurried
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:02.880]   up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups, and looked
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:09.520]   at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth,
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.200]   as Scrooge had seen them often.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:17.300]   The spirit stopped beside one little knot of businessmen.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:23.320]   Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.400]   "No," said a great fat man with a monstrous chin.
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.720]   "I don't know much about it either way.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.120]   I only know he's dead."
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:31.760]   "When did he die?"
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:32.760]   inquired another.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:33.760]   "Last night, I believe."
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.760]   "Why?
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:40.120]   What was the matter with him?" asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.360]   large snuff box.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.640]   "I thought he'd never die."
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:45.760]   "God knows," said the first with a yawn.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:52.120]   "What has he done with his money?" asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.760]   on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of a turkey cock.
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.920]   "I haven't heard," said the man with a large chin, yawning again.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.960]   "Left it to his company, perhaps."
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:06.360]   "He hasn't left it to me, that's all I know."
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:09.560]   This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.800]   "It's likely to be a very cheap funeral," said the same speaker, "for upon my life,
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.680]   I don't know of anybody to go to it.
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:19.640]   Suppose we make up a party and volunteer."
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:25.520]   "I don't mind going if a lunch is provided," observed the gentleman with the excrescence
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:26.520]   on his nose.
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:29.440]   "But I must be fed if I make one."
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.600]   Another laugh.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.200]   "Well, I am the most disinterested among you after all," said the first speaker, "for
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.480]   I never wear black gloves and I never eat lunch.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:43.120]   But I'll offer to go if anybody else will.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.040]   When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend,
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:49.680]   for we used to stop and speak whenever we met.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.440]   Bye-bye."
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.480]   Speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.960]   Scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:05.720]   The phantom glided on into a street, its finger pointed to two persons meeting.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.800]   Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:12.200]   He knew these men also perfectly.
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.920]   They were men of business, very wealthy and of great importance.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:19.760]   He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.200]   On a business point of view, that is strictly in a business point of view.
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:24.760]   "How are you?" said one.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.480]   "How are you?" returned the other.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.840]   "Well," said the first, "old Scratch has got his own at last, eh?"
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.480]   "So I'm told," returned the second, "cold, isn't it?
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.880]   Seasonable for Christmas time.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:35.600]   You're not a skater, I suppose?
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.400]   No, no, something else to think of.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:40.000]   Good morning."
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.600]   Not another word.
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.200]   That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.480]   Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.600]   conversations apparently so trivial, but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:57.240]   he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:01.720]   They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner,
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:05.400]   for that was past and this ghost's province was the future.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.600]   Nor could he think of anyone immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them,
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:14.240]   but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.440]   own improvement.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:19.840]   He resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he saw, and especially to observe
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.480]   the shadow of himself when it appeared, for he had an expectation that the conduct of
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:28.300]   his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:29.880]   riddles easy.
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:35.240]   He looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man stood in his accustomed
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.640]   corner.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.360]   And though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.520]   of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:50.100]   It gave him little surprise, however, for he had been revolving in his mind a change
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:55.960]   of life and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried out in this.
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:01.520]   Quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.480]   When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:12.680]   and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly.
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:16.960]   It made him shudder and feel very cold.
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:21.320]   They left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where Scrooge had
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:27.160]   never penetrated before, although he recognized its situation and its bad repute.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:37.240]   The ways were foul and narrow, the shops and houses wretched, the people half-naked, drunken,
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.280]   slipshod, ugly.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:47.000]   Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offenses of smell and dirt
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.400]   and life upon the straggling streets, and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.640]   filth and misery.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:03.240]   Far in this den of infamous resort there was a low-browed beetling shop below a penthouse
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:10.200]   roof where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal were bought.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:16.840]   Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files,
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:21.320]   scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds.
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:28.440]   Things that few would like to scrutinize were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags,
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:33.120]   masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:38.560]   Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:44.520]   gray-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:50.880]   air without, by a frowsy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line, and smoked his
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:55.840]   pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:00.120]   Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:07.440]   bundle slunk into the shop; but she had scarcely entered when another woman, similarly laden,
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.880]   came in too, and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:16.960]   by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other, after a short
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:22.920]   period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:25.240]   all three burst into a laugh.
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:29.360]   "Let the charwoman alone to be the first," cried she who had entered first.
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:33.520]   "Let the laundress alone to be the second, and let the undertaker's man alone to be
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.520]   the third.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.720]   Look here, old Joe, here's a chance, if we haven't all three met here without meaning
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:39.720]   it."
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:44.320]   "You couldn't have met in a better place," said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.320]   "Come into the parlor, you were made free of it long ago, you know, and the other two
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.720]   aren't strangers.
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:51.040]   Stop till I shut up the door of the shop."
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.640]   "Ah, how it squeaks.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:56.240]   There ain't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe, and
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:59.160]   I'm sure there's no such old bones here as mine.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.740]   Ha ha, we're all suitable to our calling, we're well matched.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:04.680]   Come into the parlor, come into the parlor."
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.840]   The parlor was the space behind the screen of rags.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:13.000]   The old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod, and having trimmed his smoky
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.240]   lamp, for it was night, with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:22.800]   While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:27.720]   sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:30.600]   with a bold defiance at the other two.
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:34.600]   "What odds, then, what odds, Mrs. Dilber," said the woman.
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:37.240]   "Every person has a right to take care of themselves.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.560]   He always did."
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:40.880]   "That's true, indeed," said the laundress.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.600]   "No man more so."
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:45.480]   "Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman.
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:46.480]   Who's the wiser?
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:48.960]   We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose."
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:52.000]   "No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000]   "We should hope not."
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.120]   "Very well, then," cried the woman.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:56.120]   "That's enough.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.240]   Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.480]   Not a dead man, I suppose."
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:02.360]   "No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:06.360]   "If he wanted to keep him after he was dead, a wicked old screw," pursued the woman.
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:08.600]   "Why wasn't he natural in his lifetime?
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.800]   If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death,
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:16.480]   instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself."
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:20.080]   "It's the truest word that ever was spoke," said Mrs. Dilber.
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:21.840]   "It's a judgment on him."
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:24.920]   "I wish it was a little heavier judgment," replied the woman.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.040]   "And it should have been.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:27.400]   You may depend upon it.
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:29.880]   If I could have laid my hands on anything else.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:32.680]   Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it.
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:33.680]   Speak out plain.
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:36.040]   I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it.
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:39.400]   We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here, I believe.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:40.400]   It's no sin.
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.120]   Open the bundle, Joe."
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.360]   But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this, and the man in faded black,
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.760]   mounting the breach first, produced his plunder.
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:52.520]   It was not extensive.
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:58.120]   A seal or two, a pencil case, a pair of sleeve buttons, and a brooch of no great value were
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:17:59.120]   all.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.480]   They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.960]   to give for each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.400]   nothing more to come.
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:14.400]   "That's your account," said Joe, "and I wouldn't give another sixpence if I was to be boiled
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:15.400]   for not doing it.
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:16.400]   Who's next?"
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:18.080]   Mrs. Dilber was next.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:24.560]   Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.920]   of sugar tongs, and a few boots.
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.440]   Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.440]   "I always give too much to ladies.
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.640]   It's a weakness of mine, and that's the way I ruin myself," said old Joe.
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:35.640]   "That's your account.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.420]   If you asked me for another penny and made it an open question, I'd repent of being so
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:40.000]   liberal and knock off half a crown."
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.080]   "And now undo my bundle, Joe," said the first woman.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.800]   Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:52.920]   a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.520]   "What do you call this?" said Joe.
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.520]   "Bed curtains."
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:00.760]   "Ah," returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms.
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.360]   "Bed curtains.
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.160]   You don't mean to say you took 'em down rings and all with him lying there," said Joe.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.280]   "Yes, I do," replied the woman.
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:09.280]   "Why not?"
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:14.680]   "You were born to make your fortune," said Joe, "and you'll certainly do it."
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.640]   "I certainly shan't hold my hand when I can get anything in it by reaching it out for the
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:23.200]   sake of such a man as he was, I promise you, Joe," returned the woman, coolly.
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.800]   "Don't drop that oil upon the blankets now."
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:27.880]   "His blankets?" asked Joe.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:30.440]   "Whose else's do you think?" replied the woman.
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:33.320]   "He isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say."
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.880]   "I hope he didn't die of anything catching, eh?" said old Joe, stopping in his work and
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:38.880]   looking up.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.760]   "Don't you be afraid of that," returned the woman.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.600]   "I ain't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for such things if he did."
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:48.080]   "Ah, you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find a hole
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.640]   in it nor a threadbare place.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.120]   It's the best he had and a fine one, too.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:54.160]   They'd have wasted it if it hadn't been for me."
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.040]   "What do you call wasting of it?" asked old Joe.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:00.440]   "Putting it on him to be buried and to be sure," replied the woman with a laugh.
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.840]   "Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again.
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:06.040]   If calico ain't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:07.520]   It's quite as becoming to the body.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.560]   He can't look uglier than he did in that one."
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:14.840]   Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror.
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:19.000]   As they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp,
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:25.960]   he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater, though
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:30.280]   they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:35.320]   "Ha ha!" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:38.120]   it, told out their several gains upon the ground.
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.920]   "This is the end of it, you see.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:46.720]   He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:48.520]   Ha ha ha ha!"
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:53.200]   "Spirit," said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot, "I see.
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.400]   I see.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.920]   The case of this unhappy man might be my own.
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.720]   My life tends that way now.
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:01.180]   Merciful heaven, what is this?"
[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:07.440]   He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed and now he almost touched a bed, a bare, uncurtained
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:13.520]   bed on which beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up, which, though
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:17.160]   it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:22.300]   The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced
[02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:26.840]   round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:32.080]   A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed and on it, plundered
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:39.160]   and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:41.280]   Scrooge glanced towards the phantom.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:44.200]   Its steady hand was pointed to the head.
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:48.280]   The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.880]   a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face.
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:56.680]   He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it, but had no more
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:01.480]   power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.000]   "Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful death!
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.840]   Set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command,
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:14.120]   for this is thy dominion.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:21.040]   But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:24.520]   purposes or make one feature odious.
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:28.880]   It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released.
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:36.960]   It is not that the heart and pulse are still, but that the hand was open, generous, and
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:43.520]   true, the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a man's.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:49.400]   Strike, shadow, strike, and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:52.740]   with life immortal."
[02:22:52.740 --> 02:22:58.320]   No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.780]   upon the bed.
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:05.280]   He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts?
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:06.820]   Avarice?
[02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:09.100]   Hard-dealing, griping cares?
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.220]   They have brought him to a rich end.
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:16.540]   Truly, he lay in the dark, empty house with not a man, a woman, or a child to say that
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:21.500]   he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:22.580]   to him.
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:28.540]   A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone.
[02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:33.940]   What they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge
[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:36.500]   did not dare to think.
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:40.220]   "Spirit," he said, "this is a fearful place.
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:42.020]   In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:43.780]   Trust me, let us go."
[02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:46.580]   Still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.
[02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:50.500]   "I understand you," Scrooge returned, "and I would do it if I could, but I have not the
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:51.500]   power.
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:53.820]   Spirit, I have not the power."
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.700]   Again it seemed to look upon him.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:24:02.100]   "If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man's death," said
[02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.660]   Scrooge, quite agonized, "show that person to me, Spirit.
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:07.580]   I beseech you."
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:13.700]   The phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing, and withdrawing
[02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:19.460]   it, revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were.
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:24.140]   She was expecting someone, and with anxious eagerness, for she walked up and down the
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:30.260]   room, started at every sound, looked out from the window, glanced at the clock, tried but
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:33.860]   in vain to work with her needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:35.400]   their play.
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.820]   At length the long-expected knock was heard.
[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:45.580]   She hurried to the door and met her husband, a man whose face was careworn and depressed,
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:47.380]   though he was young.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:52.180]   There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of serious delight of which he felt
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:55.100]   ashamed and which he struggled to repress.
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:59.700]   He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire, and when she asked him
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:04.580]   faintly what news, which was not until after a long silence, he appeared embarrassed how
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:05.580]   to answer.
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:08.820]   "Is it good," she said, "or bad, to help him?"
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:10.420]   "Bad," he answered.
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:12.580]   "We are quite ruined?"
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:15.260]   "No, there is hope yet, Caroline."
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:18.500]   "If he relents," she said, amazed, "there is.
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:20.700]   Nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened."
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:24.500]   "He is past relenting," said her husband.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:27.880]   "He is dead."
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:35.420]   She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth, but she was thankful in
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:40.460]   her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:45.140]   She prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry, but the first was the emotion of
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:46.140]   her heart.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:50.260]   "What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night said to me, when I tried
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:55.020]   to see him and obtain a week's delay, and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:57.700]   me, turns out to have been quite true.
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.580]   He was not only very ill, but dying then."
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:02.580]   "To whom will our debt be transferred?"
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:06.580]   "I don't know, but before that time we shall be ready with the money, and even though
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:12.640]   we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor.
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.720]   We may sleep tonight with light hearts, Caroline."
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:19.660]   Yes, soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:25.200]   The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood,
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.960]   were brighter, and it was a happier house for this man's death.
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:33.400]   The only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:38.340]   "Let me see some tenderness connected with a death," said Scrooge, "or that dark
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:44.000]   chamber spirit which we left just now will be forever present to me."
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.600]   The ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet, and as they went along
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.440]   Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:58.000]   They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house, the dwelling he had visited before, and found
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.200]   the mother and the children seated round the fire.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:04.080]   Quiet, very quiet.
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:08.120]   The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:10.680]   at Peter, who had a book before him.
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:14.800]   The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing, but surely they were very quiet,
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:17.720]   and he took a child and set him in the midst of them.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:19.160]   Where had Scrooge heard those words?
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.160]   He had not dreamed them.
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:23.360]   The boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold.
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:25.120]   Why did he not go on?
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:28.400]   The mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.960]   "The color hurts my eyes," she said.
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:31.960]   "The color?
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.480]   Ah, poor tiny Tim."
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:35.880]   "They're better now again," said Cratchit's wife.
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.200]   "It makes them weak by candlelight, and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:40.680]   he comes home for the world.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:42.040]   It must be near his time."
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:44.920]   "Past it, rather," Peter answered, shutting up his book.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.360]   "But I think he's walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings, mother."
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.880]   They were very quiet again.
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:57.800]   At last, she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice that only faltered once, "I have known
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:03.720]   him walk with tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed."
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.440]   "And so have I," cried Peter often.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.560]   "And so have I," exclaimed another.
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.240]   So had all.
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:13.680]   But he was very light to carry, she resumed, intent upon her work.
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:17.760]   And his father loved him so that it was no trouble, no trouble, and there was your father
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:18.760]   at the door.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:21.880]   She hurried out to meet him, and little Bob and his comforter—he had need of it, poor
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:23.280]   fellow—came in.
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:28.080]   His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most.
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:31.680]   Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:35.880]   his face, as if they said, "Don't mind it, father, don't be grieved."
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:39.200]   Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:43.240]   He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:44.400]   and the girls.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:47.040]   They would be done long before Sunday, he said.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:48.040]   "Sunday?
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:49.760]   You went today then, Robert?" said his wife.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:51.600]   "Yes, my dear," returned Bob.
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:53.080]   "I wish you could have gone.
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:56.040]   It would have done you good to see how green a place it is, but you'll see it often.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:59.080]   I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday.
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:02.640]   My little child, my little child!" cried Bob.
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.880]   "My little child!"
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:06.200]   He broke down all at once.
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:07.840]   He couldn't help it.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:10.840]   If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:11.840]   they were.
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:16.360]   He left the room and went upstairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully and
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:17.360]   hung with Christmas.
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:22.840]   There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of someone having been
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:25.000]   there lately.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.160]   There Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he
[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.200]   kissed the little face.
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:35.000]   He was reconciled to what had happened and went down again, quite happy.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.160]   They drew about the fire and talked, the girls and mother working still.
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:44.060]   Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely
[02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:47.640]   seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:52.560]   a little, just a little down, you know, said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress
[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.560]   him.
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:56.160]   "I'm sorry, Mr. Scrooge," said Bob, "for he is the pleasantest spoken gentleman you
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:57.160]   ever heard.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:29:58.160]   I told him."
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:01.960]   "I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit," he said, "and heartily sorry for your good
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:02.960]   wife."
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:05.560]   By the by, how he ever knew that, I don't know.
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:07.040]   "Knew what, my dear?"
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.560]   "Why, that you were a good wife," replied Bob.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:11.360]   "Everybody knows that," said Peter.
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:13.480]   "Very well observed, my boy," cried Bob.
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:14.480]   "I hope they do.
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:16.720]   Heartily sorry," he said, "for your good wife."
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:21.160]   "If I can be of service to you in any way," he said, giving me his card, "that's where
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:22.160]   I live.
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.320]   Pray come to me."
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:27.680]   Now it wasn't, cried Bob, for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:31.080]   much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful.
[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:35.120]   It really seemed as if he had known our tiny Tim and felt with us.
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:38.080]   "I'm sure he's a good soul," said Mrs. Cratchit.
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:42.800]   "You would be sure of it, my dear," returned Bob, "if you saw and spoke to him.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.680]   I shouldn't be at all surprised.
[02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:47.240]   Mark what I say if he got Peter a better situation."
[02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:50.120]   "Only hear that, Peter," said Mrs. Cratchit.
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:54.080]   "And then," cried one of the girls, "Peter will be keeping company with someone and setting
[02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:55.360]   up for himself.
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:58.080]   Get along with you," retorted Peter, grinning.
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:00.200]   "It's just as likely as not," said Bob.
[02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:03.960]   "One of these days, though there's plenty of time for that, my dear, but however and
[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:08.240]   whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny Tim,
[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:09.240]   shall we?
[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:11.160]   Or this first parting that there was amongst us?"
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:12.960]   "Never, father," cried they all.
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:17.360]   "And I know," said Bob, "I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:22.920]   mild he was, although he was a little, little child, we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:25.400]   and forget poor tiny Tim in doing it."
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:28.120]   "No, never, father," they all cried again.
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:30.400]   "I am very happy," said little Bob.
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.920]   "I am very happy."
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:35.960]   Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, and his daughters kissed him.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:40.000]   The two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:45.880]   "Spirit of tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God."
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:51.000]   "Spectre," said Scrooge, "something informs me that our parting moment is at hand.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.240]   I know it, but I know not how.
[02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:55.720]   Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead."
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:32:00.800]   The ghost of Christmas yet to come conveyed him as before, though at a different time,
[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:01.800]   he thought.
[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:06.240]   Indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the future,
[02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.680]   into the resorts of businessmen, but showed him not himself.
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:13.760]   Indeed, the spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on as to the end just now
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:17.480]   desired until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.
[02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:21.760]   "This court," said Scrooge, "through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation
[02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:23.880]   is, and has been for a length of time.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:25.080]   I see the house.
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.720]   Let me behold what I shall be in days to come."
[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:29.080]   The spirit stopped.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:30.400]   The hand was pointed elsewhere.
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:32.760]   "The house is yonder," Scrooge exclaimed.
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:34.720]   "Why do you point away?"
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:37.680]   The inexorable finger underwent no change.
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:40.040]   Scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in.
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:42.160]   It was an office still, but not his.
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:45.560]   The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.
[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:47.480]   The phantom pointed as before.
[02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:51.320]   He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:52.760]   they reached an iron gate.
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:54.960]   He paused to look round before entering.
[02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:55.960]   A churchyard.
[02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:01.720]   Here, then, the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground.
[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:06.520]   It was a worthy place, walled in by houses, overrun by grass and weeds.
[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:11.400]   The growth of vegetation's death, not life, choked up with too much burying.
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.560]   Fat, with repleted appetite.
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:15.080]   A worthy place.
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:19.040]   The spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one.
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:22.240]   He advanced towards it, trembling.
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:26.480]   The phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:27.720]   solemn shape.
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:32.000]   "Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point," said Scrooge, "answer me one
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000]   question.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.640]   Are these the shadows of things that will be, or are they the shadow of things that may
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:40.640]   be only?"
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:45.040]   Still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.920]   "Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which, if persevered in, they must
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:51.240]   lead," said Scrooge.
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:55.680]   "But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:59.520]   Say it is thus with what you show me."
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:04.320]   The spirit was immovable as ever.
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:11.800]   Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went, and following the finger, read upon
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:20.520]   the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:26.800]   "Am I that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried upon his knees.
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.200]   The finger pointed from the grave to him and back again.
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:31.520]   "No, spirit!
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.400]   No, no, no!"
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.160]   The finger still was there.
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.800]   "Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe.
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:38.800]   "Hear me!
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.400]   I am not the man I was.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:44.760]   I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse.
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.920]   Why show me this if I am past all hope?"
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:50.360]   For the first time the hand appeared to shake.
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:54.200]   "Good spirit!" he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it.
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:57.640]   "Your nature intercedes for me and pities me.
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:02.000]   Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life."
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.800]   The kind hand trembled.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:08.880]   "I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year.
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:12.320]   I will live in the past, the present, and the future.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:15.360]   The spirits of all three shall strive within me.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.760]   I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.520]   Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!"
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:26.680]   In his agony he caught the spectral hand.
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:30.720]   It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it.
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:33.760]   The spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.800]   Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.960]   the phantom's hood and dress.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:53.200]   It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:54.840]   Stave 5, The End of It
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.120]   Yes, and the bedpost was his own.
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:35:59.120]   The bed was his own.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.120]   The room was his own.
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:04.920]   The best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own to make amends in.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.280]   "I will live in the past, the present, and the future," Scrooge repeated as he scrambled
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:10.280]   out of bed.
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.800]   "The spirits of all three shall strive within me.
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:16.400]   Oh, Jacob Marley, heaven in the Christmas time be praised for this.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:19.680]   I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees."
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:23.480]   He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:25.240]   scarcely answer to his call.
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.200]   He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:30.200]   tears.
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:33.960]   "They are not torn down," cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed curtains in his arms.
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.840]   "They are not torn down, rings and all.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:36.840]   They are here.
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:37.920]   I am here.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:40.420]   The shadow of the things that would have been may be dispelled.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:41.420]   They will be.
[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:42.560]   I know they will."
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:45.760]   His hands were busy with his garments all this time, turning them inside out, putting
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:49.360]   them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making the parties do every kind of
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.360]   extravagance.
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:53.960]   "I don't know what to do," cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath and
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:56.440]   making a perfect laucoon of himself with his stockings.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.000]   "I am as light as a feather.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:59.680]   I am as happy as an angel.
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.280]   I am as merry as a schoolboy.
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:03.160]   I am as giddy as a drunken man.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:05.320]   A merry Christmas to everybody.
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.600]   A happy new year to all the world.
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.600]   Hello there.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:09.600]   Hello."
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:13.640]   He had frisked into the sitting room and was now standing there, perfectly winded.
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.640]   "There's the saucepan that the gruel was in," cried Scrooge, starting off again and going
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:18.640]   around the fireplace.
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:22.000]   "There's the door by which the ghost of Jacob Marley entered.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000]   There's the corner where the ghost of Christmas presents sat.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.440]   There's the window where I saw the wandering spirits.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:28.440]   It's all right.
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:29.440]   It's all true.
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.440]   It all happened."
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:35.440]   Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh,
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:40.080]   a most illustrious laugh, the father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs.
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:42.760]   "I don't know what day of the month it is," said Scrooge.
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:44.800]   "I don't know how long I've been among the spirits.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:45.800]   I don't know anything.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:46.800]   I'm quite a baby.
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:47.800]   Never mind.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:48.800]   I don't care.
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:49.800]   I'd rather be a baby.
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:50.800]   Hello.
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:51.800]   Hello there."
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.640]   He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:04.280]   heard, clash, clang, hammer, ding, dong, bell, bell, dong, ding, hammer, clang, clash.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:06.440]   "Oh, glorious, glorious."
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.560]   Running to the window, he opened it and put out his head.
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:15.320]   No fog, no mist, clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold, cold, piping for the blood to dance
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:20.560]   to, golden sunlight, heavenly sky, sweet, fresh air, merry bells.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.840]   "Oh, glorious, glorious.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:23.840]   What's today?"
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.360]   cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:28.840]   to look about him.
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.840]   "Eh?"
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.320]   returned the boy with all his might of wonder.
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:34.520]   "What's today, my fine young fellow?" said Scrooge.
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:37.840]   "Today," replied the boy, "why, Christmas Day."
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:40.240]   "It's Christmas Day," said Scrooge to himself.
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:41.680]   "I haven't missed it.
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:43.480]   The spirits have done it all in one night.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.480]   They can do anything they like.
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:45.480]   Of course they can.
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:46.480]   Of course they can.
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:47.480]   Hello, my fine fellow.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:48.800]   Hello," returned the boy.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.600]   "Do you know the poulterers in the next street but one at the corner?"
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.600]   Scrooge inquired.
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:55.640]   "I should hope I did," replied the lad.
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.960]   "An intelligent boy," said Scrooge.
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.480]   "A remarkable boy.
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:01.560]   Do you know whether they've sold the prized turkey that was hanging up there?
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:03.400]   Not the little prized turkey, the big one."
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:04.400]   "What?
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:05.880]   The one as big as me?" returned the boy.
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:07.720]   "What a delightful boy," said Scrooge.
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:09.320]   "It's a pleasure to talk to him."
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:10.320]   "Yes, my buck."
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.680]   "It's hanging there now," replied the boy.
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:14.160]   "Is it?" said Scrooge.
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.160]   "Go and buy it."
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.160]   "Walker?" exclaimed the boy.
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:20.160]   "No, no," said Scrooge.
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:21.160]   "I'm in earnest.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:24.680]   Go and buy it and tell him to bring it here, but I may give him the direction where to
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:25.680]   take it.
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:27.920]   Come back with the man and I'll give you a shilling.
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:31.200]   Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you half a crown."
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:32.600]   The boy was off like a shot.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:35.920]   He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:40.320]   "I'll send it to Bob Cratchit," whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands and splitting with
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:41.320]   a laugh.
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.680]   "He shan't know who sends it.
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:44.680]   It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:48.080]   Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be."
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.520]   The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but righted he did somehow
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.560]   and went downstairs to open the street door ready for the coming of the polterer's man.
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:58.200]   As he stood there awaiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.680]   "I shall love it as long as I live," cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand.
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:03.800]   "I scarcely ever looked at it before.
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:06.120]   What an honest expression it has in its face.
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.600]   It's a wonderful knocker.
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:08.600]   Here's the turkey.
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:09.600]   Hello!
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:10.600]   How are you?
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:11.980]   Merry Christmas!"
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:13.520]   It was a turkey.
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:15.560]   He never could have stood upon its legs, that bird.
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.840]   He would have snapped him short off in a minute like sticks of sealing wax.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.080]   "Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town," said Scrooge.
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:23.560]   "You must have a cab."
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:26.440]   The chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:29.400]   and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:33.400]   the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:36.160]   again and chuckled till he cried.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.760]   Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much, and shaving
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:43.020]   requires attention even when you don't dance while you are at it.
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:46.040]   But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking plaster
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:48.260]   over it and been quite satisfied.
[02:40:48.260 --> 02:40:51.680]   He dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets.
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:55.220]   The people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of Christmas
[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:57.880]   present and walking with his hands behind him.
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:00.420]   Scrooge regarded everyone with a delighted smile.
[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:02.700]   He looked so irresistibly pleasant.
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:06.140]   In a word that three or four good-humored fellows said, "Good morning, sir.
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:07.140]   Merry Christmas to you!"
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.760]   And Scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.720]   were the blithest in his ears.
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.240]   He had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.520]   walked into his counting house the day before and said, "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe."
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:23.580]   It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when
[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:26.840]   they met, but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it.
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.200]   "My dear sir," said Scrooge, quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:31.800]   his hands, "how do you do?
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:33.540]   I hope you succeeded yesterday.
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:34.600]   It was very kind of you.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:36.840]   A merry Christmas to you, sir."
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:38.080]   "Mr. Scrooge?"
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:42.220]   "Yes," said Scrooge, "that is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you.
[02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:45.440]   Allow me to ask your pardon, and will you have the goodness?"
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:47.360]   Here Scrooge whispered in his ear.
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.640]   "Lord bless me!" cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:52.760]   "My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?"
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:55.440]   "If you please," said Scrooge, "not a farthing less.
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.540]   A great many back payments are included in it, I assure you.
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:41:59.880]   Will you do me that favor?"
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:03.680]   "My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him, "I don't know what to say to such
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:04.680]   munificent—"
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:07.640]   "Don't say anything, please," retorted Scrooge.
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:08.840]   "Come and see me.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:10.000]   Will you come and see me?"
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.520]   "I will!" cried the old gentleman, and it was clear he meant to do it.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:15.560]   "Thank ye," said Scrooge, "I am much obliged to you.
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.400]   I thank you fifty times.
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:18.400]   Bless you!"
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:22.240]   He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro,
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:25.620]   and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens
[02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:30.380]   of houses and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.
[02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:35.480]   He had never dreamed that any walk, that anything, could give him so much happiness.
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.160]   In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's house.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:43.040]   He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock, but he
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:44.640]   made a dash and did it.
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.480]   "Is your master at home, my dear?" said Scrooge to the girl.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:48.480]   "Nice girl, very.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.480]   Yes, sir."
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:51.480]   "Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.600]   "He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress.
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.320]   I'll show you upstairs, if you please."
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:58.640]   "Thank ye, he knows me," said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:00.200]   "I'll go in here, my dear."
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:02.960]   He turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door.
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:05.720]   They were looking at the table, which was spread out in great array, for these young
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:09.520]   housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:11.200]   "Fred!" said Scrooge.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.120]   Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:16.640]   Scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with a footstool,
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:18.360]   or he wouldn't have done it on any account.
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.400]   "I bless my soul!" cried Fred.
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:21.400]   "Who's that?"
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:22.920]   "It's I, your Uncle Scrooge.
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:23.920]   I have come to dinner.
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:25.560]   Will you let me in, Fred?"
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:26.560]   Let him in?
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.360]   It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:30.240]   He was at home in five minutes.
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:31.320]   Nothing could be heartier.
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:32.580]   His niece looked just the same.
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:34.160]   So did Topper when he came.
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:36.360]   So did the plump sister when she came.
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:38.600]   So did everyone when they came.
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:44.320]   Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, wonderful happiness!
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:46.320]   But he was early at the office next morning.
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:47.600]   He was early there.
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:50.580]   If he could only be there first and catch Bob Cratchit coming late.
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:52.660]   That was the thing he had set his heart upon.
[02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:53.660]   And he did it.
[02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:54.660]   Yes, he did.
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:55.660]   The clock struck nine.
[02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:56.660]   No Bob.
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:57.660]   The quarter passed.
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:58.660]   No Bob.
[02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:01.520]   He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:05.680]   Scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank.
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:07.520]   His hat was off before he opened the door.
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:08.560]   His comforter too.
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:11.600]   He was on his stool in the jiffy, driving away with his pen as if he were trying to
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:12.960]   overtake nine o'clock.
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:16.640]   "Hello," growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it.
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:18.960]   "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?"
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:20.880]   "I'm very sorry, sir," said Bob.
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:22.520]   "I am behind my time."
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:23.520]   "You are?"
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:24.520]   Repeated Scrooge.
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:26.560]   "Yes, I think you are.
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:27.960]   Step this way, sir, if you please."
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:31.400]   "It's only once a year, sir," pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank.
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:32.520]   "It shall not be repeated.
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:34.680]   I was making rather merry yesterday, sir."
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:37.680]   "Now, I'll tell you what, my friend," said Scrooge.
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:42.520]   "I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer, and therefore," he continued,
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:45.520]   leaping from his stool and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:49.640]   into the tank again, "and therefore I am about to raise your salary."
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:51.680]   Bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler.
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:55.600]   He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him and calling to the
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.920]   people in the court for help in a straight waistcoat.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:01.640]   "A merry Christmas, Bob," said Scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:02.840]   as he clapped him on the back.
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:06.720]   "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year.
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:11.160]   I'll raise your salary and endeavor to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:16.120]   your affairs this very afternoon over a Christmas bowl of smoking, Bishop Bob.
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:21.080]   Make up the fires and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another I, Bob Cratchit."
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:22.480]   Scrooge was better than his word.
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:28.560]   He did it all and infinitely more, and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:29.560]   father.
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:34.280]   He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old city knew,
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.120]   or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:41.480]   Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:45.560]   heeded them, for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe for
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:49.640]   good at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset, and knowing
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:53.280]   that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.480]   wrinkle up their eyes and grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms.
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.560]   His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for him.
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:05.360]   He had no further intercourse with spirits, but lived upon the total abstinence principle
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:11.400]   ever afterwards, and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well,
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:14.600]   if any man alive possessed the knowledge.
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:20.200]   May that be truly said of us, and all of us.
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.920]   And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless us, everyone.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:35.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
