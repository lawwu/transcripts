[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   I should like to call your attention once more to the message of this great third chapter
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.160]   of the book of Genesis, concentrating particularly this evening on the ninth verse, the ninth
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.040]   verse in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, Where art thou?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.140]   And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, Where art thou?
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.940]   Now before we can possibly understand the meaning of that statement, we must again remind
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.180]   ourselves of the great context.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.920]   This is one of the most important chapters in the whole Bible, because in this one chapter
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.460]   we really have a history of mankind, a history of the world, and at the same time all the
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460]   main outlines of salvation.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.220]   Here in the chapter the whole thing is summarized for us, and that is why we are considering
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.180]   it for the fourth Sunday evening in succession this evening.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.140]   We are doing so, as I have been explaining, because there is such a pathetic and ridiculous
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.860]   attitude on the part of so many.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.980]   It is based on nothing but sheer ignorance that somehow or another the Bible, while a
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.820]   very interesting old book, is a book that has got nothing to do with the modern world
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.980]   and with modern life.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.420]   It is the very essence of preaching to deal with that situation, because the Bible rarely
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.660]   is concerned about nothing but that.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.940]   It is a timeless book, because it is a book about life, a book about the soul.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.260]   It is a book from God, giving us a view of ourselves and of all others, showing us the
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.540]   causes of our troubles and our problems and our predicaments, showing us the sheer waste
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.060]   of energy, apart from anything else, that is involved in trying to settle and to solve
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.580]   our problems and our difficulties and perplexities in any other way save that which it offers
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.820]   to us so freely in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.100]   Now all that I say is summarized for us in this one particular chapter.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.300]   Here is the history without which we cannot understand why the whole world is as it is
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   tonight and why any one of us in particular is as he or she is at this moment.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.460]   There is no other true explanation.
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.060]   There are many others being offered, of course, and we are familiar with them.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.980]   And our position is that having looked at them all and having believed many of them
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.980]   and having tried them and having found them all to fail, as the Bible told us from the
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.260]   beginning that they must and would, we come back to this.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260]   And this authenticates itself in experience.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.860]   It has been doing so throughout the running centuries.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.220]   And its claim is that it is as true tonight as it has ever been and as relevant to the
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.700]   modern men in his predicament as it was a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.740]   and even three thousand years ago.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.340]   Now that is the general position.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.620]   And I have been at pains to emphasize this, that this chapter is not only a record of
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.340]   actual history.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.700]   In addition to that, it is a full explanation of what we each one of us do in turn.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300]   That is the remarkable thing about the Bible.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.020]   That is why it gives us so much history.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.900]   Every one of us in turn repeats what was done at the beginning, and we go on repeating it.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.500]   That is why there is, as the author of Ecclesiastes tells us, nothing new under the sun.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.220]   And there really isn't as far as men is concerned.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220]   You look at that like this, if you like.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.540]   If you think that we are all so different from what men have been in the past, you just
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.140]   make a collection of the things that people are doing in London at this moment.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.740]   Make a list of them, and you will find that they were all being done in the Old Testament.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.060]   Not in exactly the same form, perhaps, but the same things are being done.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340]   There is no difference there at all.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.860]   You will find it all here.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.140]   There are men in all his cleverness and with all his brilliant advances and inventions
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.580]   seems quite incapable of inventing a new sin.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.580]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.740]   He can't think of a new sin.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.140]   They've all been thought of before, and they've all been practiced.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.500]   You see, men, according to the Bible, and I suggest to you that our own experiences
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.540]   and the history of the world at this moment confirms it absolutely, men rarely as a being
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.340]   doesn't change at all.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.180]   So that what we find in this third chapter of Genesis is true tonight of every human
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.340]   individual in this world.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.340]   Very well.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.340]   What have we seen?
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.580]   We've seen something like this.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.660]   We've seen that there is but one real cause of all our troubles, and that is a wrong attitude
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.940]   towards God.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.740]   That's the one and only cause of all our troubles.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.580]   Everything stems out of that, a wrong attitude to God.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.380]   And now we've been spending our time in particular in tracing that and analysing it.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.260]   We've considered it purely intellectually on one Sunday evening, how men put up his
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.180]   own philosophy and began to query and to question and acted upon his own idea.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.140]   That was the cause of the whole trouble.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.780]   Last Sunday night we went on and we considered some of the things to which that led.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:27.020]   How men suddenly became aware of his nakedness, this awful, dogging sense of loss and of incompleteness,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.540]   this awareness of a contradiction in our being, and then the futile attempt to deal with it
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.820]   and the failure that's quite inevitable.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.780]   And then the sense of guilt and of shame, the fear of life and the fear of death.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.260]   All that, it came at once and we all know it, it's been repeated in everybody's experience.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.460]   And then finally you remember how even when God comes to us, we run away from him because
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:59.380]   of our totally wrong idea concerning him, man's final tragedy is that he refuses the
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:06.420]   one thing that can put him right, the tragedy of man spiting himself, running away from
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.620]   the only one who can really bless him.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.620]   Very well.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:17.840]   Now then, we go on from that point, because the story goes on.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.780]   And that is why we are continuing this evening.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.980]   And that's really the only point I have to make tonight.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.100]   We've seen what it was that men did in order to produce the fall, and we've seen what he
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.940]   is like as the result of the fall.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.060]   Well you might have thought, well the story ends there, but the story doesn't end there.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.900]   The story goes on.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.600]   And the story must go on.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.940]   And you see it is a central message of the Bible just to say that, that the story will
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.580]   go on.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.180]   Now we'd like it not to go on, we'd like it to stop there, but no, the story will go on
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.260]   and must go on and does go on.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.660]   And why does it go on?
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:09.180]   Well the story goes on according to this record, because whether we like it or not, this is
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.180]   God's world.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.780]   And we are in God's world.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.420]   And you cannot stop God coming into his world, into his own property, into his own possession.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.840]   You see we never like that, of course that's the whole essence of our modern objection
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.020]   to God and the natural men's objection.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.660]   We think we've got rid of him and finished with God and we are going to do things and
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.500]   we are going to carry on now without God.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.380]   And we decide to do so constantly.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.140]   But as I say, the story doesn't end there.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.460]   You remember that eighth verse don't you, and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.160]   in the garden in the cool of the day.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.020]   And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.780]   of the garden, as if to say, if we only get behind there and hide, he'll just walk straight
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.700]   on and then we'll be able to come out again and all will be well.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.020]   And if we hear him again we'll go back and on we'll continue.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.860]   But that isn't the story.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:21.460]   The back of the trees belong to God quite as much as the front of the trees.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.140]   The whole garden belongs to God.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.620]   The universe is God's.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.780]   So I say the story has got to go on and the story does go on.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.580]   And this is the first thing surely that we all need to learn and to grasp.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.220]   We're not independent creatures in this world.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:50.580]   We don't own it and we cannot order it and we cannot decide what happens in it and what's
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.140]   going to happen to it.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.300]   That's the first great lesson here.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.820]   It's God from beginning to end.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.760]   It's God making the world and it is his world.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.540]   He owns it, it's his possession.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.340]   He controls it, he sustains it, he guides it, he interferes with it, he comes into
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.740]   it, he erupts into it.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.300]   It's always God's.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.740]   That's the lesson.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:22.500]   God coming into the garden when men thought that he had finished with God.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.380]   And what God does, you see, as we are reminded here, is this.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.060]   God continues to speak.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.060]   That's the thing.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's here from beginning to end again.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.820]   God made man in his own image and he spoke to him.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.180]   And men listened and replied, that was perfection, that was paradise, that was man as he was
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.340]   meant to be.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.860]   Man listening to God.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.860]   God speaking.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.300]   It's the greatest thing a man can ever know, to be addressed by God, to be spoken to by
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   God.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.500]   But man decided to stop that.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.880]   He didn't want that anymore.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.460]   He didn't believe that any longer.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.740]   And as I say, he thought it ended there, but it doesn't.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.140]   God goes on speaking.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.420]   He's hidden to hide himself at the back of the trees.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:12.300]   But this is what happens, "And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, Where
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.740]   art thou?
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.140]   And he hears it and he can't avoid it, he can't evade it, and he has to come out of
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.140]   his hiding.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.220]   Where art thou?
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.440]   And that, my dear friends, is the whole meaning of a meeting such as this tonight.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.580]   It's God speaking, God addressing us.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.100]   And God is doing this in so many different ways.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.620]   Speaks in the conscience, speaks in history, speaks in events.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.060]   You can't understand history apart from that.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.940]   You'll get a great deal of it, and certainly the only adequate explanation of it in this
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   book.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.980]   But even out there in secular history, God is speaking.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.660]   God has an endless number of ways of speaking to us.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.780]   We are all so deaf as the result of sin.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.780]   It isn't always an audible voice such as that which was heard by Adam and Eve there hiding
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.620]   behind the trees.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.580]   Oh, God speaks to us, I say, in thought.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:20.180]   Job tells us that he does it at night sometimes when men have become very impervious by dreams
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.260]   and visions in the night.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.800]   He does it by accidents.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.100]   He does it by illnesses.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.500]   He does it by death.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.580]   Oh, God speaks to men.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.980]   It's the great message of the Bible.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.100]   God speaking, God saying things to us.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:43.220]   And here supremely, He does it in this word of His, which is His word addressed to us.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.660]   And then beyond it all, God speaks to us in His Son.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.380]   The great opening, you remember, of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.500]   God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake to our fathers in times past through
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:03.700]   the prophets, has in these last days spoken unto us in His Son.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   God speaking.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:10.100]   Now that's the whole message of the Bible that God is addressing us.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.500]   Well very well, let us now concentrate on how He does so, because it's all suggested
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:21.060]   to us, it seems to me, in this ninth verse and in some of the following verses.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.820]   The first thing I notice is that God addresses us personally.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.700]   "And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, Where art thou?
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.700]   Where art thou?
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.700]   Where art thou?
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.820]   Put your emphasis wherever you like.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:45.740]   A personal address to Adam.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.460]   Now here, it seems to me, is one of the things which we have to grasp at the very outset
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.940]   and at the very beginning.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.700]   And we all know by experience that there is nothing which we are so slow to grasp and
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.900]   to understand as just this very thing.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.660]   You see what happens.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:09.380]   Before we come to this verse, we find a good deal of conversation by other people.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.940]   And they've been talking about God.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.980]   "Yea," says the devil, "hath God said?"
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.260]   And Eve replies, "Yes, God has said this and that."
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.500]   Adam and Eve and the devil, as it were, are having a conversation about God and they're
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.740]   expressing their opinions about God.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.980]   But suddenly the whole situation changes in this ninth verse.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.640]   God addresses Adam and Eve, hiding behind the trees.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.460]   And you see at once the positions are reversed.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:48.140]   And that is the first thing that happens to a man who is on the way to becoming a Christian.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:54.700]   The first thing we become conscious of is that we are being addressed.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.500]   Or if you prefer it in another term, take it like this.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.540]   Adam suddenly discovered that he, far from being the investigator, was the one who was
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.540]   being investigated.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:10.580]   "Adam, where art thou?
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.500]   The Lord God has come down and he is looking, he is investigating, he is searching."
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   Adam and his position and condition are under investigation.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:26.060]   Adam, before that, you see, had been walking about this garden, he'd listened to the suggestion,
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.440]   and he thought he was in a position of supremacy and he was looking on and he was expressing
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.620]   his opinions.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:40.420]   But suddenly he finds himself addressed, under examination, investigated.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.420]   Surely my meaning is perfectly clear.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.380]   You have a discussion with people about religion and about Christianity, and you'll always
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.100]   find that they talk as the investigators.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.460]   The great brain is going to look into this question of the Bible.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.140]   He's going to investigate God.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.620]   Of course, he's got the equipment, he's able to do so.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:13.300]   And God, well, God is a kind of specimen, as it were, to put on the table, to be dissected,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.360]   to be analyzed, to be considered.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.260]   With our great minds, we look round God.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:26.260]   And then we even, perhaps, dissect and bring out our microscopes.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:34.220]   Modern men investigating the universe, investigating religion, investigating God.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.620]   Men on the throne, on the bench.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:43.420]   Ah, yes, he is considered Buddhism and Confucianism, Hinduism.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   Quite so.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   Let's try Christianity.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.020]   Well, now, what about Christianity?
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.780]   I'm not caricaturing it, am I?
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.300]   Haven't we all done this?
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:59.260]   We imagine that we are the investigators and that we are in a position to investigate.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:07.420]   But suddenly, man is brought to the realization that he's the one who's being examined.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.020]   That he's betraying himself without realizing it.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.140]   And the more he talks, the more he is betraying himself, and the more he's being examined
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.460]   and investigated.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.380]   I don't want to stay with this, but I do want to ask a question.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:34.620]   Had you realized, my friend, that in this life and in this world, you were on trial?
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.300]   You were not trying, you were on trial.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.940]   You were being tried.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:45.540]   How slow we are to realize this, shall I sum it up by putting it in the form of what a
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:52.660]   great man once said.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:18:00.220]   He was referring to a man who said that he saw absolutely nothing in the novels of Sir
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.260]   Walter Scott.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.900]   To which the comment made by this man was that the man, in saying that, that he thought
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:17.180]   nothing about Sir Walter Scott, was not really telling us anything about Scott, but telling
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.860]   us a very great deal about himself.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.620]   And how true it is.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.860]   Modern man, you see, doesn't hesitate to dismiss Beethoven.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.460]   He's not interested in that sort of stuff.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.460]   And as he says that, I would repeat that he tells us nothing about Beethoven, but he does
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.900]   tell us a tremendous lot about himself.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.780]   Well, it's exactly the same with regard to this whole matter.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:50.140]   We fondly imagine that we are in the position of investigators and examiners, but suddenly
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.500]   something happens to us and we are conscious of the fact that we are being looked at, that
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:04.020]   we are being addressed, we are being spoken to, a word comes to us.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.420]   Have you reached that stage, my friend?
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:16.340]   Have you realized that in this life and in this world we are but journeymen and travelers?
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.220]   And that you're not simply a spectator sitting in a gallery looking on at some game that's
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.140]   being played by other people in the arena.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.500]   Don't you realize that you're in it and that you're involved and that every second you
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.680]   live judgments are being formed about you?
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.820]   And you are determining not only what happens to you in this world, but in eternity by what
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.820]   you do here.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.980]   It's you are involved.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.420]   But let me put that in a slightly different form.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:54.780]   Adam suddenly realized and was made to realize that he was not only being addressed, but
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:01.220]   that it is he himself as an individual and as a person that's being considered.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:08.020]   I mean by that that what is under investigation is not merely his ideas and his thoughts and
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:14.460]   his positions in a philosophical sense, but he himself.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:20.660]   And this is absolutely true about us all.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.500]   Christianity is not a matter of opinions.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.340]   And as God addresses us in these various ways that I've been indicated, he isn't talking
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.220]   to us about our opinions at all.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.020]   He's not a bit interested in them.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.500]   But he's interested in us.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.180]   "Where art thou?
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.620]   Thou, I'm speaking to you, Adam.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.140]   Where are you?"
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.460]   That's what God says.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.060]   But how cleverly we avoid all this.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.920]   We think it's all a matter of opinions.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.200]   And we are ready to express our opinions and to have our arguments.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.260]   And people think that Christianity, as I say, is a matter like that, that if you discuss
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.620]   Christianity, well, what do you start with?
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.300]   Well, you may start, if you like, with the being of God.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.500]   Well, all right, let's take that up.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   Then having dealt with that, you say, well, then there's this question of miracles, of
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   course.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   Are miracles possible?
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.500]   Can they happen?
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.940]   Well, you spend another evening discussing miracles.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.260]   This is all discussing Christianity, isn't it?
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.140]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.060]   And then you come to the person of Jesus of Nazareth, the claim, the Christian dogma has
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.740]   always said that he was God and men, that there are two natures in that one person.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.760]   Very well, well, we must spend at least a night on this.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   Let's have this out.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   Is that possible?
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   Is it conceivable?
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   Can it happen?
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.240]   And then there's this question of the death on a cross on Calvary's Hill, and again the
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.400]   great doctrine of the church about something called atonement, that one died for others,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   that he made himself a substitute and so on.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   Well, we take this up.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   Is this moral even?
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   Is it conceivable?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   Can it happen?
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.800]   And we spend a whole night arguing about that.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   And the whole time, you see, we think we've been arguing and discussing Christianity.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:12.600]   There is a sense, of course, in which we have, but there is another sense in which we haven't.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.560]   Because my friend, you can not only go to your grave, but you can even go to hell just
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.600]   doing that.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.680]   Christianity primarily is not a discussion about ideas, it is a discussion about you.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.720]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.840]   I'm looking for you.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.040]   I'm interested in you, the individual person.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.840]   And my dear friend, that's the first thing that a man realizes who is on his way to becoming
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   a Christian.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.120]   For all of his life he's never faced himself at all.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.000]   You see, he's been protecting himself.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.320]   He's been putting up a camouflage to conceal himself.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.560]   That's the meaning of all the arguments and disputations about these various Christians.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.800]   He's been shielding himself.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.700]   There are the trees of the garden.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.920]   We hide behind them.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.440]   Now here's something coming which is going to be a little bit personal, we think, and
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   it's going to be difficult.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.880]   Very well, let's hide behind the trees.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.240]   And we hide behind the trees of these philosophies and ideas and comparative religions and all
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.640]   these abstruse questions.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:23.720]   And as long as we're there, it's all outside us, but God penetrates through it all.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   It's about you, my friend.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.840]   You as an individual seated in this chapel at this moment.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:39.680]   It's all about you and your life and what you're doing with it and where you're going.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.200]   Has it come personally to you yet?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.900]   Or tell me, may I ask another question?
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.320]   Do you resent this personal emphasis?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.240]   I think I've quoted you before what Lord Melbourne, one of the Victorian Prime Ministers, said
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   in this connection.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.400]   Oh, he spoke for many a modern man.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.760]   The great Lord Melbourne said, "Things have come to a very pretty past if religion's going
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.120]   to start being personal."
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.720]   Ah, religion, Christianity, what is it?
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:18.200]   Ah, it's a question of marriage and divorce, that's it.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.840]   Now is the church right?
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.280]   Perhaps someone came expecting that I'd be preaching about that.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.880]   Not at all, my friend.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.640]   I know you too well to do that and I know myself too well.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.040]   It would be very nice to sit back and listen to my expression of my opinions on the Archbishop
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.600]   of Canterbury and on these other matters.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.280]   Wonderful, and we'd have a great discussion, wouldn't we?
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.400]   Yes, but I wouldn't be preaching the gospel.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:49.280]   I'm preaching about you, not about the Archbishop of Canterbury nor anybody else.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.960]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.240]   Have you realized that this is a personal matter, a personal decision, a personal coming
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.420]   face to face with God?
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.840]   You are confronted by God.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.000]   God's addressing you.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   God's speaking to you, to you.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.180]   Not interested primarily in your ideas, but in you yourself as you pass through this life
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.280]   and through this world once and once only.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.280]   What next?
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.220]   Well, the next step in it is this.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:32.640]   He forces us to face where we are and what we are.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.320]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   Where exactly are you and what are you doing there?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:51.880]   In other words, this whole business of preaching and of the gospel brings me face to face with
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:59.360]   the fact of where I am and of where I ought to be.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.280]   When God, as it were, had come into that garden before, which was called Paradise, Adam was
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.700]   always there to meet him, looked forward to his coming, rejoiced in his coming, ran to
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.560]   meet him with a smile upon his face.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.280]   For the first time he doesn't do that.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.960]   He's hiding behind some trees and God says, "Where are you?
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   What are you doing there?
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.280]   You've never been there before.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   What are you doing there?
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   Come out.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   That's not the place for you.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   You oughtn't to be there.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   You ought to be here.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.800]   What are you doing there?"
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.560]   And that's precisely what God is asking every one of us at this moment.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.960]   Where are you?
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.680]   Where are you in life and in this world?
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.560]   Let me subdivide it.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.760]   Where are you intellectually?
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.400]   Where are you in your thinking?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.280]   Have you rarely faced all the facts?
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.420]   May I put it as simply and as bluntly and as plainly as this?
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.640]   You may say to me that you've long since rejected Christianity.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.220]   Well, I only want to ask one question.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.800]   Have you ever really read the Bible through?
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.840]   Because I find that all of us tend to dismiss Christianity without really knowing what it
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   is.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   We've never taken the trouble to do so.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.160]   We've dismissed it as a prejudice.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   We haven't read the Bible.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.400]   We haven't even read the New Testament through.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.580]   We know nothing about the history of the church, but we dismiss it.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.840]   Now I say that that's intellectually dishonest.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   It's not straight.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:39.080]   Where are we, I say, in the matter of the mind and the whole process of thought and
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.620]   the whole and the complete view of life?
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   Have we rarely brought all the factors and all the facts in?
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.840]   Have we brought life itself in and our conduct and our behaviour?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.060]   Have we rarely listened to the voice of conscience?
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.680]   Have we rarely looked into the face of death?
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.020]   Have we looked beyond?
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.280]   Have we considered the testimony of some of the best and the greatest men that the world
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   has ever known?
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.520]   Have we rarely brought all this in?
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.240]   Have we read the history of revivals?
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.500]   Where are we intellectually?
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.720]   Now the Bible challenges us to do that.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.960]   That's the message of the Word of God.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.040]   It knows perfectly well that we're always hiding behind these intellectual trees.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.580]   I've already mentioned a large number of them.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.480]   But as long as you're there, you're not seeing things straight.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.040]   It must come out into the open, says the Bible.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   But rarely face it.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.440]   "Ah, but you see, I've always thought that Christianity is sub-stuff."
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   Exactly.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.160]   That's because you didn't know what it was.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.080]   You've dismissed it without considering it.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   It's reasonable.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   It's argument.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   It's here.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   It's got a case.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.280]   It comes to you as a fully-orbed revelation of the truth of God.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.120]   I mustn't keep you with this.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.280]   You'll find it in many books.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.800]   One of them just out recently.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.440]   Did I mention it the other night or not?
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.920]   Or else you may say you can't dispute the brain power of Mr. C.S. Lewis, can you?
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:09.160]   Well, just read his latest book, Surprised by Joy, in which he tells you something of
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.720]   his history in these matters.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.160]   But he's only one of many.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.320]   My friends, it's intellectually dishonest to say that Christianity isn't intellectually
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   respectable.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.880]   That's hiding behind trees.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:27.960]   That's a refusal to come out into the open and really face it all and really try it.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.800]   So I say that the Bible asks us, "Where are we intellectually?"
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   And in the same way, and perhaps with much more insistence, it comes to us and asks us
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   the question as to where we are morally.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.640]   Morally.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:52.680]   Oh, how much easier it is to be arguing about philosophy and theology than to be facing
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.160]   ourselves.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:06.720]   In a moral sense, where are we in the matter of chastity, in the matter of purity, in the
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:17.200]   matter of honesty, in the matter of soul cleanliness, in the whole matter, I say, of our life and
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   living?
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:25.240]   Now, my friend, that's the first thing, surely, that we all ought to be considering.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.900]   Before you try to understand miracles, let me commend to you that you start trying to
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.400]   understand yourself.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.440]   Why do we go on doing things that we know to be wrong?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.060]   Why do we get pleasure in doing so?
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.960]   Why do we do them though we know that we'll have pain having done so?
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.280]   Why do we do them?
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.920]   That's the problem.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.240]   That's the real issue facing man.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   Not his grand opinions about abstractions, but himself.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.640]   "Adam, where are you?
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.800]   Where are you morally?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   What are the moral credits with which you began?
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   What's the account like this evening?
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.000]   Where is it?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.120]   What if the books were opened in public?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.240]   What if your life and your story could be flashed onto a screen?"
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.880]   You know, see, that's what the Bible is interested in.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.360]   That's what it's talking about.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.800]   It's personal and it's direct and it's about our own lives.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   Let me give you the supreme example of this which is to be found in the Scriptures in
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.080]   the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John in our Lord's dealings with
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   the woman of Samaria.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.520]   It's all there absolutely perfectly.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   You remember what happened.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.000]   Our Lord was tired.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.720]   He sat down by the side of the well and the woman came along to draw water and at once
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.240]   they began to talk.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.720]   And they began to talk about Jews and Samaritans.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.960]   They began to talk about the well and the depth of the well to whom had Jacob given
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.260]   it exactly.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.640]   You remember the questions, don't you?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.200]   And the woman was enjoying it and arguing very cleverly.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.800]   Then they go on to talk about God and talk about worship.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.320]   Should you worship in this mountain or in Jerusalem?
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   That's it.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.080]   This whole ecclesiastical problem.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.220]   South India and the new church and do I believe in this or not?
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   Do I believe in denominations?
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   Oh, it's marvelous.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.220]   It's wonderful.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:20.560]   And on they went until suddenly our Lord ended it all by saying this, "Woman, go fetch
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.440]   thy husband and come hither."
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:33.760]   And the woman had to reply honestly and say, "I have no husband."
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.600]   And our Lord looked at her and said, "Thou hast said the truth.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.720]   I have no husband.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:50.080]   For thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.440]   In that saidst thou truly."
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.400]   That's the Lord Jesus Christ's method.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.560]   He puts an end to all this argument and disputation about the thousand and one questions.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.520]   He brings it right home to the woman herself.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.740]   Here is a woman who will talk about God and about worship and about all these things.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.960]   And she was living in adultery at that very moment and our Lord makes her face it.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.520]   "Come out," he says, "from behind that tree.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   Come out into the open.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   I know all about you.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   Marley?"
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:30.800]   And that is the thing that God is saying to all of us at this moment.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.400]   My dear friend, face yourself and your own life.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.920]   What you are actually doing, what you actually are, the thoughts that you fundle, the imaginations
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.440]   that you delight in, the things you do, the things that you know perfectly well as I am
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.480]   speaking to you are in your mind at this moment and you are ashamed of them.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.440]   And you wouldn't come up into this pulpit and confess that you are guilty of them all.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.600]   That's what God is talking about.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   That's Christianity.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   "Adam, where art thou?
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:05.520]   Come out from that hiding place."
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   Is it clear, my friends?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.400]   Oh, let me give you just one other illustration of it from the Old Testament.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   The famous story of David, you remember?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   David was suddenly tempted and his lust got the better of him.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.440]   And he committed adultery and then to cover it over he committed murder.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   And he thought all was well, but God had seen it and God was displeased and God sent his
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.240]   servant Nathan to talk to David and Nathan adopted this form.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.040]   He put a conundrum to him.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.560]   He said, "Oh, King," he said, "do you know what's happened?"
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.160]   And he painted a picture of a man who'd got a lot of sheep and who then stole the sheep
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.000]   of another man whose only sheep it was.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.960]   And David was filled with wrath and indignation and said, "The man who does a thing like
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.000]   that is a man who must be punished severely.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.560]   Nothing is too bad for him."
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.760]   And Nathan paused and looked at him and said, "Thou art the man.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.740]   I'm speaking about you, David.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:18.080]   You thought that I was putting a question of equity to you and discussing a moral problem
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   in general with you.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.160]   David, King, I've been speaking about you.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.960]   Thou art the man, Adam.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   Where art thou?"
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.200]   It's you, it's your life, it's your moral behavior, it's your total personality that's
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.400]   under investigation.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:39.080]   And then the next thing, and it's the last at this point which I've got to emphasize
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.520]   is this.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:48.240]   When God comes to us and speaks to us thus personally, he makes us realize the true nature
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.200]   and character of what we have just been doing.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.280]   You notice he puts it like this.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.120]   In the eleventh verse I read, "And God said, 'Who told thee that thou wast naked?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:06.580]   Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commended thee, that thou shouldest not eat?'"
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.560]   You see, he brings it right home to Adam and Eve.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   He makes them see and face the exact nature of what they've been doing, the thing they've
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.760]   done.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.000]   It's not just a question of eating fruit, it's that they have broken his commandment,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.720]   that they've violated his holy law, that they've raised themselves up in rebellion against
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   him.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.080]   He brings it right home to them.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.660]   And you know this gospel does that.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.320]   It not only brings it to me personally and makes a general investigation, it fixes and
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.200]   establishes sin.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   How does it do it?
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.840]   Well, it teaches me the true nature of sin.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.600]   I've just been quoting that case of David.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.280]   Let me come back to it again.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.760]   David, after he'd seen the truth and after he'd repented, sat down and wrote the 51st
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.800]   Psalm.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.720]   And in that, when he deals with this very sin that he'd committed, he puts it like
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:10.000]   this, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   What's he mean?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.960]   Well he means this.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.160]   The terrible thing about sin, really the thing that makes sin, sin says David, is not so
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.280]   much that I've been guilty of adultery and of murder, that's bad enough, but the terrible
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.240]   thing is that I have sinned against God.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.160]   I violated the law of my being.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.560]   I am a rebel against God.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.400]   That's the thing that we don't see.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.800]   We are prepared to admit the category of sin and of wrongdoing, perhaps, but we regard
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.720]   it just as some transgression of a moral code, the breaking of a law, and we say there's
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:54.440]   no more in it, but my dear friend, there is.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:03.680]   You and I as human beings were made originally in the image of God, and we were meant to
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.280]   live a life that such a person should live.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.600]   We were meant to be in correspondence with God, in enjoyment of God.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.520]   We were meant to be righteous and holy and true and upright.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.800]   That is what we are meant to be, and what is sin?
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.320]   It's a departure from that.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.840]   The trouble is, isn't it, that we all tend to think of sin only in terms of particular
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.800]   actions.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   But the terrible thing about sin is that it's a violation of God's creation.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.760]   It's robbery of God.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.640]   It's us spitting into the face of God, and any life tonight which is not lived to the
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.120]   glory of God is in the depth of sin.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.760]   Now God makes Adam see all this, and Eve sees it, and anyone who comes under conviction
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.120]   of sin must of necessity see it.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:05.080]   So the final question and the vital question for all of us is just this one.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.240]   Where are you at this moment face to face with God?
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.360]   Do you know Him?
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.760]   Do you love Him?
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.880]   Do you delight in Him?
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.880]   Is it your greatest concern to please Him and to live to His glory and to His honor?
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.000]   God would have you see that unless it is that, that you're a vile sinner.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.520]   He brings it home to you.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.560]   You've departed from where He put you.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   You're hiding somewhere.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.120]   You're out of the pathway.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   You're not in the true.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.600]   You're not in the straight.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.160]   You're somewhere where you shouldn't be, and you're transgressing this law of your
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.640]   very being.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.600]   God brings us to see that.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.200]   And isn't that the thing that's so lacking in the modern world?
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   There are many people who believe in respectability, but they don't believe in God.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.320]   And they are as terrible sinners as are the people who are living in the gutters of London
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.000]   at this moment.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It's against God.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.600]   "I have sinned," says the prodigal son, "I have sinned against heaven and before
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.560]   thy face."
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.320]   And it's always true of us, the nature of sin.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.560]   But that brings me to my last point, which is this one.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:30.080]   That God, when He thus comes to us and addresses us and speaks to us, not only gives us this
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:37.400]   personal address along the lines I've been mentioning, in order to bring us to repentance,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:43.480]   He then proceeds to tell us about judgment.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.640]   You remember how He did it there in the garden at the beginning?
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.520]   He has been repeating it ever since.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.680]   It is being repeated in the history of the world and of every human individual at this
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.880]   very moment.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.440]   God came to them and having thrown them out of the hiding place, they've seen themselves
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.880]   and their sin.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.200]   God then pronounces judgment.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.760]   I'm very sorry, my friend.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.200]   You probably don't like this idea of judgment.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.080]   No natural man has ever liked judgment.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.280]   But whether we like it or not, it's a fact.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.160]   And God Himself has revealed it.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.920]   He revealed it there, I say, at the very beginning.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.560]   He came after men.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.120]   You can't get away from God.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.800]   Of course, you can walk out of this service and say you'll never come back again.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.920]   But what's the point of that?
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.800]   That's not walking out of God's universe.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.640]   That's not walking outside the eye of God.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.120]   Hide yourself, get away, rush into the brushwood and into the thickets and imagine that He
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   won't see you.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.640]   He'll call you out of it.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.680]   And He has ever called men out of it.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   And what is His judgment?
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.640]   Well, you can subdivide it into the present and the future.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.400]   There is an immediate judgment that always comes because of sin and as the result of
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   sin.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   What's that?
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.680]   He pronounces here that there is going to be a perpetual conflict between the serpent
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:33.520]   and the woman and the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, a conflict.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.800]   And isn't it absolutely true?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.000]   Are we not all in this conflict and don't we all know all about it?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.680]   The temptation, evil, drawing us, enticing us, battling against that which is best and
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.640]   noblest and most upright in us.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.600]   Don't you see it everywhere?
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.880]   It does it in the newspapers, it does it on the hoardings, it does it in all places of
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.200]   amusement, it does it on the streets.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.520]   It's the whole problem of life and of existence.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.200]   The struggle between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.320]   The moment we enter into this life, we are in it already.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.680]   The battle of morality, the battle of purity, the battle of chastity, the battle of honesty
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.320]   and what a fight it is.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.440]   The current is drawing us down.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.280]   How difficult to fight against it and to battle upstream.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.360]   Don't we all know it?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:31.720]   It's a verification of God's judgment.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.040]   And the blindness that sin produces in us prevents us seeing that all that is nothing
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.520]   but a part of God's judgment on sin.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.080]   You see, men thought that by listening to the devil and eating that fruit he was going
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.560]   to have an easy time, that there would be an end of conformity to law, that he'd be
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.160]   a god, he'd be absolutely free.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.840]   But he put himself into the shackles and into the chains and he's struggling in them ever
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.960]   since.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.400]   Seed of the serpent, seed of the woman, locked in this endless fight.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.360]   The hell that life can be to a man.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.880]   We're all in it and we've all known it.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.960]   Not only that but the sorrow and the suffering.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:27.000]   In sorrow shalt thou conceive, in pain and suffering does woman bring forth.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.680]   You see, it's history, it's facts.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.000]   But my friend, it's a part of God's judgment.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.520]   It wasn't meant to be like that.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.160]   This is a part of God's pronouncement on men in rebellion and sin.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.120]   What is there a greater joy than the coming of a child into a family?
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.760]   But think of the accompaniments, think of the strain, the struggle, the suffering, the
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.000]   oft sorrow.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.740]   It's sin that's produced all that.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.120]   It's men's wrong attitude to God.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.240]   It's men's rebellion against God.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.440]   It's men taking the law unto himself.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:09.200]   That's why there's all this suffering and sorrow and illness and disease and pain and
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.360]   problem.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.920]   But not only that, the very struggle for existence itself.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:26.120]   The struggle and the toil of earning one's livelihood, getting one's daily bread.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.720]   The hardness, the thorns and the thistles, the competition and the troubles.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.200]   Why is it that thorns and thistles grow so abundantly?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.520]   Why is it so difficult to get a crop out of the ground, of wheat or of corn?
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.600]   Why is this?
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.040]   Why this ever fighting against it, everything against us?
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.840]   All we get we have to work for like this with the very sweat of our brow.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:56.200]   It's again nothing but a part of God's judgment on sin, my friend.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:02.600]   And man's been trying to deal with it and to cope with it ever since, but he cannot.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.520]   He would like to get back to that paradise, but he's been driven out of it.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   God drove the man out of it, and he put the cherry bimbs and the flaming sword turning
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.240]   in every direction.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.320]   And though man in civilization has been rushing up against that gate and trying to burst his
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   way through, the flaming sword keeps him back.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:35.800]   So that the whole story and history of civilization in a sense is but the history of futility,
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.280]   the history of failure.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.540]   Some great historians you see are not even Christians at all.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.840]   They say that in this way they talk about the cyclical theory of history.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.680]   We ever seem to be advancing.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.080]   We're on the point of getting there, but we just go around the other side of the circle
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.920]   and we are back to where we were.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.680]   Civilization goes round and round in cycles.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.280]   There's no forward advance.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.560]   There's no end.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.040]   There's no reaching of the ultimate objective.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.680]   It's simply a futile procedure.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.080]   Round and round we go.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   We rise.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   We succeed.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   We fail.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.080]   We fall.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.080]   Down they go.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.000]   It's the same with empires, individuals.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.040]   It's always true.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.360]   It's the flaming sword and the cherubim at the east end of the Garden of Eden.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.960]   Man will never get back there by his own effort.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   He's incapable of it.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   He's not allowed to do it.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.800]   He's been driven out.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.280]   That's the judgment upon sin.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:47.560]   But that's only the present and there's something beyond.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.280]   Unto the dust thou shalt return.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.640]   Death, physical death.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:02.040]   It came in as a part of the punishment of sin.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:11.280]   Tennyson tells us that man thinks he was not made to die.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.560]   That's just a part of his recollection of what he once was.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.320]   As he is now, he's got the seeds of mortality within him.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.160]   And the moment he's born, he's beginning to die.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.580]   There was a little baby born a second ago.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.080]   You say there at Ennerty someone was beginning to live.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:34.160]   I can say with equal accuracy, there is someone who has started dying.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.240]   The first breath is but the first of a series that's leading to the last.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.800]   That's not being morbid, that's being factual.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.440]   We are born to die.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.600]   It comes to pass.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:49:02.640]   Death, the inevitable end, and beyond it, God, facing God.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.840]   Oh, my dear friends, my time has gone.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.340]   But you know you've got to face all that.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.940]   And you don't come to the gospel until you've faced all that.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.480]   This is no sob story.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.400]   This is no patent remedy.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.840]   This is not one of your optimistic philosophies.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   This is not a kind of spiritual cohesion that says, "Come along, let's be bright and cheerful
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.760]   and happy and walk with a new step.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   It's all right."
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:44.360]   It's terribly wrong.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.800]   And God would never see how terribly wrong it is.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.920]   Do you realize where you are, Adam?
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.440]   Where are you?
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.480]   Where are you at this moment?
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.120]   How long have you lived in this world?
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.440]   How much longer do you think you're going to be here?
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.160]   What have you done with your life?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.640]   What have you made of it?
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   What of your record?
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.720]   Are you proud of it?
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.360]   What's your achievement?
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.280]   What's your secret life?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.840]   What's the history of your mind and your thought and your imagination and your heart?
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   What is it?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   Adam, where are you?
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   In every respect, where are you, man?
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   Where are you, woman?
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   Come out of that hiding place and face it, for you've got to.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.360]   You're in God's world.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.120]   You're God's creature.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.240]   And you can't avoid Him.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.440]   You can't evade Him.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.880]   You can't escape Him.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   You've got to deal with Him.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.000]   And He'll call on you.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.280]   And if you don't listen to Him in life, you'll have to listen to Him in death.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:54.200]   And when your name is called out at the great judgment throne in eternity, you'll have to
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:07.760]   stand forward and listen to the verdict.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.280]   I don't stop there, do I?
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.760]   And you know I don't stop there.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.960]   But I know this, that nobody's really going to listen to what I'm about to say who doesn't
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.920]   believe what I've just been saying.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.000]   It's only the desperate who come to Christ.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.320]   It's only those who know that they're sick who see their need of a physician.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.720]   And that's the sickness.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.760]   But thank God there is the physician.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.600]   I told you about the judgment that He went on.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.160]   There is to be this struggle between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:59.240]   But the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:06.280]   The God who calls you to come out of your hiding place calls you out not only to condemn
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:16.760]   you but to tell you that if you believe and acknowledge the condemnation, He has a way
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.000]   to bring you back to paradise.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:29.480]   For He has sent His only Son, the seed of the woman, into this world to do something
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:39.560]   which makes, when He advances, the cherubim and the flaming sword to fall back and to
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.560]   allow us in.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:51.120]   Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, has borne the judgment of the sin of all who believe
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.560]   in Him and who look to Him.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   And if you trust in Him, He will take you through the gate into the joy of the Lord.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:12.800]   And if you enter in with Him tonight, you will be able to say, "Today, thy mercy calls
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.240]   us to wash away our sin.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.380]   However great our trespass, what error we may have been, however long from mercy we
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:33.720]   may have turned away, thy blood, O Christ, can cleanse us and make us white today."
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:48.920]   Thank God for this gospel because when all things seem against us to drive us to despair,
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:59.260]   we know one gate is open, one ear will hear our prayer.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:05.860]   If you have heard God speaking to you, you will cry out unto Him for mercy.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:10.220]   And He will not refuse you; He will receive you.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:16.880]   "For all sin that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:27.600]   So from your hiding place of failure and shame and misery and unhappiness, come out and cry
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.960]   to Him, and He will deliver you."
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
