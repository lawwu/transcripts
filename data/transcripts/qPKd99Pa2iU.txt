[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.160]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.360]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.640]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.720]   Today's episode marks the second episode
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.480]   in our four episode series with Dr. Paul Conte
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.840]   about mental health.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.720]   The first episode in the series dealt with how to understand
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.940]   and assess your level of mental health.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.400]   Today's episode is about how to improve your mental health.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200]   I do want to emphasize that you do not need to have heard
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.080]   or seen the first episode in order to understand
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.400]   or glean important information from today's episode
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.180]   about how to improve your mental health.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600]   But I do encourage you to go and listen to the first episode
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.960]   at some point if you have not already.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.120]   Today's episode deals with several topics important
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.140]   to all of us, as well as protocols
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.620]   to improve one's mental health.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.080]   For instance, you will learn how to guide yourself
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.000]   through a process of self-inquiry
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   in which you address certain key questions
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.980]   about your drives, your level of aggressive drive,
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.160]   pleasure drive, and the so-called generative drive.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.960]   These are essential things to understand about oneself
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.920]   if you want to guide yourself toward your aspirations,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.540]   and if you want to understand
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.860]   how your subconscious processing is influencing your thoughts
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.240]   and your behaviors and your feelings
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.920]   in ways that sometimes serve your aspirations
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   and in other ways that can hinder your aspirations.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560]   Dr. Conte shares with us a way
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.620]   of assessing our internal narratives,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.560]   as well as a way of creating a constructive self-awareness
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.780]   and an understanding of where those narratives
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.460]   and that self-awareness stem from in our childhood
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.000]   so that we can navigate forward
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.940]   with the greatest sense of agency.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.480]   We also talk about how to move past common hindrances
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.960]   to improving one's mental health,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180]   such as overcoming intrusive thoughts.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.840]   And perhaps most importantly,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.260]   today's episode provides information and protocols
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.400]   that anyone can use to cultivate their generative drive,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.480]   which is a hallmark of mental health.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.140]   Just a reminder that Dr. Paul Conte
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.900]   has generously provided a few diagrams
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.140]   that we include as PDFs in the show note captions.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.180]   They are completely zero cost to access,
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.300]   and they can help you understand some of the material
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.720]   that was discussed in the first episode of this series,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.020]   as well as the current episode
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.620]   about how to improve your mental health.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.660]   And while those simple PDF diagrams
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.140]   are certainly not necessary
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.900]   in order to understand the material in today's discussion
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.780]   or in the other discussions of this series,
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.080]   many people find them useful.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.740]   So I encourage you to check out those links
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.980]   in the show note captions.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.580]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.420]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.580]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.580]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.420]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.180]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940]   I personally have been doing weekly therapy
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.500]   for more than 30 years.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.900]   And while that weekly therapy was initiated
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.380]   not by my own request,
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.340]   it was in fact a requirement for me to remain in high school,
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.140]   over time, I really came to appreciate
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.500]   just how valuable doing quality therapy is.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.120]   In fact, I look at doing quality therapy
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.800]   much in the same way that I look at going to the gym
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   or doing cardiovascular training such as running
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.580]   as ways to enhance my physical health.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.700]   I see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.640]   The beauty of BetterHelp is that they make it very easy
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.340]   to find an excellent therapist.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.760]   An excellent therapist can be defined as somebody
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.340]   who is going to be very supportive of you
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.620]   in an objective way with whom you have excellent rapport with
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.080]   and who can help you arrive at key insights
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.260]   that you wouldn't have otherwise been able to find.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.780]   And because BetterHelp therapy is conducted entirely online,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.240]   it's extremely convenient and easy to incorporate
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.620]   into the rest of your life.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.000]   So if you're interested in BetterHelp,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.700]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.740]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.600]   That's BetterHelp spelled H-E-L-P.com/huberman.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.060]   Waking Up is a meditation app that offers dozens
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.840]   of guided meditation sessions, mindfulness trainings,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   By now, there's an abundance of data showing
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000]   that even short daily meditations can greatly improve
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.560]   our mood, reduce anxiety, improve our ability to focus,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.540]   and can improve our memory.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.920]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.460]   most people find it difficult to find and stick
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.040]   to a meditation practice in a way
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.200]   that is most beneficial for them.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.220]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.720]   to learn how to meditate and to carry out
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.980]   your daily meditation practice in a way
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.080]   that's going to be most effective and efficient for you.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.660]   of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.880]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   that allows you to emerge feeling
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.920]   incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.580]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.860]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.720]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   by up to 60%, which places the brain and body
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.280]   into a state of enhanced readiness
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.760]   for mental work and for physical work.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.800]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.440]   is that it provides a 30-day introduction course.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.040]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.520]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.580]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.260]   and regular meditator, Waking Up has more advanced
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.960]   meditations and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.840]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.600]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   and access a free 30-day trial.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.040]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.080]   And now for my discussion about mental health
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.880]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   Dr. Conte, welcome back.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.420]   - Thank you.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.500]   - In the first episode of this series,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.980]   you laid out for us in a very structured way
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.160]   what true mental health looks like,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.920]   essentially what we should all be aspiring to.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.560]   And you touched on these themes of agency and gratitude
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.800]   as verb states, really ways of being in the world
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.220]   that allow everybody to have some sense of wellbeing,
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.720]   to have some sense of themselves in a way
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.840]   that is kind to themselves and to others,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.160]   and really to feel good and do good in their life.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.800]   And without question, this is what people want, right?
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.860]   You also spelled out for us these two pillars,
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.320]   the structure of self and the function of self
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.680]   that consists of a number of different things
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.480]   that from which guys are up or kind of, you know,
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.200]   give rise to these feelings of empowerment, humility,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.120]   agency, and gratitude.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.800]   And reminded us several times that when we are challenged,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.020]   when we're not doing as well as we would like,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.280]   that we need to look back to the structure of self
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.360]   and the function of self and ask specific questions
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.860]   in order to arrive or re-arrive
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.540]   at the sense of agency and gratitude.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.560]   - Yes.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.760]   - I think it would be wonderful for us
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.920]   if you could just recap the overall model
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.840]   because it has the components that I just mentioned,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.520]   but there's some subtlety and some really key aspects
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.480]   of these pillars, structure of self and function of self.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.860]   I think if people keep in mind for today's episode,
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.880]   which is about challenges that people commonly face,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   and even if you will,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   phenotypes that we see commonly out there.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.880]   For people that haven't heard of phenotypes,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.920]   phenotypes are the typical appearance of something.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.940]   So there is the phenotype of the anxious person,
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.120]   the phenotype of the person who just can't seem
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.040]   to get out of a rut.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.620]   There's the phenotype of the traumatized person.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.200]   And these things play out differently
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   in different individuals, men and women, boys and girls.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.340]   But we're going to visit many of the most common phenotypes
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.220]   out there and think about how to do better, be better,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.700]   feel better through the lens of the model
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.240]   that we spelled out in episode one.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.040]   And of course, if people have not seen or heard episode one,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.460]   today's discussion will still be entirely accessible to them.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.360]   So in keeping with that,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.660]   if you could just give us an overview
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.040]   of what this structure of the healthy self looks like
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.440]   as a roadmap for where we're all headed today.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.940]   - Thank you, thanks very much.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.000]   Revisiting the pillars is I think the best place to start
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.560]   because there really are routes to understanding.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.060]   And if we understand, then we can strategize,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.680]   we can make change, we can make things better.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.880]   So the first pillar of the structure of self
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.760]   starts with the unconscious mind, right?
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.600]   This incredibly complicated biological supercomputer
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.800]   that's firing a mile a minute underneath the surface in us
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.840]   and is throwing up to the surface all sorts of thoughts
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.640]   and ideas and states
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.000]   that then the conscious mind apprehends
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.080]   and our awareness comes into play.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.900]   And then we have defense mechanisms
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.520]   that sort of rise up from the unconscious mind
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.840]   and they circle and sort of gird themselves
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.460]   around the conscious mind,
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.440]   which they can do in an unhealthy way
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.120]   or in a healthy way or anything in between.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.880]   And then the character structure
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.680]   is sort of the nest around all of that.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.500]   And it's from the character structure
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.420]   that we are engaging in the world
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.240]   in the ways that we're engaging, right?
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.760]   It's our active engagement with the world around us.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.320]   And the idea is that the self grows out of that.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.800]   It grows out of that nest
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.760]   sitting on top of the unconscious mind
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.520]   to the conscious mind rising above the defense mechanisms
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.040]   and the character structure.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.920]   And if we go back to that
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.400]   when we're trying to understand ourselves,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.960]   trying to understand states of health
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.760]   as well as states of unhappiness
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.480]   or states that aren't healthy,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.820]   by going back and looking at the structure,
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.080]   we can learn a tremendous amount.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.360]   And the other side, the other pillar,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.540]   is the function of self.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.940]   And it really starts with the self-awareness, right?
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.080]   The awareness that, hey, there is an I, right?
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.520]   I am in the world, right?
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   These 24 hours in the day are gonna pass today
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.520]   and I'm gonna be doing one thing or another.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.260]   I'm to some very significant extent
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.840]   deciding how am I gonna engage in the world around me
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.200]   during that time, right?
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.520]   So on top of that are the defense mechanisms in action.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.060]   So defense mechanisms, remember, are unconscious.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.680]   So there's a lot then going on inside of us
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   that's determining sort of the field set of options, right?
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.800]   There may be a lot of automaticity
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.280]   that narrows down the set of options
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.020]   of what we may entertain, what we may be aware of,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.100]   what we may decide.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.020]   And that could happen for better or for worse,
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.140]   depending upon the health of the defense mechanisms.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.800]   But on top of that lies salient.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.020]   So the idea then we would next visit,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.500]   okay, what are we paying attention to, right?
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.300]   What's coming from inside, what's coming from outside?
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.040]   And we have to not pay attention
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.700]   to many, many, many, many things
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.380]   in order to pay attention to
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.920]   whatever our attention is alighted on at the moment.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.560]   So it's a complex process
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.080]   and it's worth looking at very closely
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.960]   if we wanna understand ourselves.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.340]   So after thinking about the defense mechanisms in action,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.440]   right, the unconscious aspects
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.900]   of how we're engaging with the world,
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.300]   then next to consider is salience,
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.660]   which is sort of where does the mind arrive at at rest,
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.640]   right, where does the mind trend towards?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.340]   Is it something internal, is it something external?
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.380]   What are all the things we're not paying attention to
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.860]   in order to pay attention to something?
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.660]   And is that thing healthy, is it not healthy?
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.980]   Is it serving us well?
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.860]   So there's so much to understand about salience.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.620]   And then the next step beyond that
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.120]   is understanding behavior, right?
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.900]   How are we engaging with the world around us?
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.320]   What are our behavioral choices?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.500]   What are our automatic behaviors?
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.980]   And then sitting on top of all of that are our strivings.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.060]   So we have a sense of wanting something
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.900]   in the world around us, like what is that
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.220]   and how are we trying to get to it
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.940]   and how does it make us feel?
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.220]   So if we look at the 10 elements, right,
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.260]   the five under the structure of self
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.360]   and the five under the function of self,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.340]   then what we're really looking at is
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.500]   sort of like looking at 10 cabinets, right?
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.820]   And if we're trying to understand ourselves,
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.120]   whether we're trying to just generally understand ourselves
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.340]   or we're trying to get at a problem, right,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.440]   then looking in all 10 of those cabinets makes sense, right?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.540]   Some of them will be bare,
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.800]   meaning that they may seem to have very little to do
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.020]   with the problem we're bringing.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.700]   And we kind of maintain an open mind, right?
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.220]   We may be led back to that cabinet
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.900]   and there may be something there.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.020]   But what usually happens is if we look in all 10 places,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.220]   we find a couple where there's some rich material to explore
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.620]   sort of the X marks the spot
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.400]   and then we go and we dig there to sort of mix metaphors.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.740]   We dig in the cabinet
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.380]   where we're gonna find something, right?
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.960]   And then it leads forward a process of understanding.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.220]   And if we're bringing those things into line
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.560]   where we have a healthy structure of self
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.900]   and a healthy function of self
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.660]   and we're aware of all of this and we're working on it,
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.500]   we're self-aware and we're paying attention
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.660]   to everything built on top of that,
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.020]   then what we end up with is a sense of humility
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.940]   because one cannot be anything but respectful,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.900]   compassionate, understanding the complexity of all of this
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.620]   and understanding how does it manifest itself in us
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.300]   and just the very fact that we can wake our ways
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.580]   in the world, right, is so impressive.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.740]   And in a way, I think it brings to us a respect,
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.060]   just a respect for being here, navigating the world,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.760]   and I think of that respect is born humility,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.820]   the complexity of us,
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.620]   the fact that millions of things
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.020]   are going on underneath the surface,
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.980]   millions of neurotransmission and endocrinological function,
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.380]   all of this is going on under the surface.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.380]   I'm not even aware of it
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.340]   and then it kicks up to the surface,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.980]   generates a tremendous amount of respect for the complexity
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.180]   and also the diligence and perseverance it takes us
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.400]   to navigate through the world.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.740]   And I think built upon that understanding
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.840]   is a sense of humility and a sense of empowerment
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.860]   and the humility and empowerment in action, right?
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.040]   So expressed, right, become agency and gratitude
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.660]   and agency and gratitude, as you said at the beginning,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.560]   we're seeing as verbs, right?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.200]   That's like how we're living life.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   It's through the lens, so to speak,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.860]   of agency and gratitude that we're actively living.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.280]   And again, I would put forth
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.120]   that when we look at measures of human happiness, right,
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.580]   across disciplines and across time,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.300]   this is always what we see,
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.640]   is some way of describing how agency and gratitude
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.320]   together as verbs manifest and then create happiness.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.360]   It's the state that we're seeking to be in, right?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.380]   Because from that state of active agency
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.420]   and active gratitude, we achieve what it is
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.180]   that I think we're really searching for.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.240]   And there are by infinite words throughout human history
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.080]   to describe what that is,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.740]   we might choose to use words like peacefulness,
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.840]   a sense of peace, a sense of contentment,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.920]   being delighted by things, like just being amazed
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.480]   and impressed by things in the world around us.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.400]   Like this is a state that we're striving for.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.240]   And I think when people talk about happiness
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.500]   and what we're really trying to get to, it's this, right?
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.560]   But it's not that these things are passive, right?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.880]   These things are coming from the active agency,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.040]   the active gratitude, and they're then interacting
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.960]   with a generative drive within us.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.600]   We have an aggressive drive, we have a pleasure drive.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.740]   Like this has been thought about now for a long, long time
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.680]   within mental health and validated in a lot of ways.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.080]   But what hasn't been validated
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.000]   is that they're the only things, right?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.860]   We see human beings striving.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.400]   We see human beings wanting better for themselves
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.040]   and for the world around them.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.860]   We see acts of kindness that seem to be rooted
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.780]   to nothing other than the act of kindness.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.900]   We have within us a drive to know, to understand,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.700]   to learn, to make better.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.940]   And that has been described
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.260]   as many, many things across human history.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.000]   But I think the words we might choose are generative drive,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.440]   a drive to create and to make better.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.780]   And it's the generative drive
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.620]   as something active within us, right?
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.780]   That is then aligning with agency and gratitude, right?
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.700]   The active ways in which we express ourselves.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.180]   And then that altogether brings us the peace,
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.160]   the contentment, the sense of delight.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.460]   Sometimes that may exist in us in a state of rest, right?
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.460]   But very often it's existing in us in a state of activity.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.980]   And that's why people find the quote unquote happiness
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.840]   of what people are seeking, not just in meditation.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.060]   Sometimes we can find it there,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.140]   but people also find it in action, right?
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.340]   They find it in doing that thing that they love to do
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.300]   or taking care of someone and learning something.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.120]   So when we look at all of this,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.340]   we can then have a route of understanding
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.120]   what is going on inside of us
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.460]   and how we can make the changes
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.880]   that let us be in this state,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.640]   which is really the state that we're seeking.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.180]   - I really appreciate that you highlight
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.880]   that agency and gratitude are verb states
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.020]   from which peace, contentment and delight emerge.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.340]   And also the way that you explain the generative drive
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.140]   that is distinct from aggressive drives
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.400]   and pleasure drives that exist in all of us.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.660]   I'm smiling because a number of examples
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.100]   of peace, contentment and delight
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.720]   while in action come to mind.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.680]   I mean, for me, podcasting and in particular,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.980]   preparing for a podcast and mine the literature
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.600]   and figure out where the gems reside
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.980]   and where the confusion could emerge
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.860]   and all of that brings about such peace, contentment
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.280]   and delight for me, but it's anything but passive.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   It's, likewise, yesterday I had the experience
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.020]   of running into a puppy.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.420]   It's been a while since I've owned a dog
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.620]   and dogs are delightful.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.820]   Puppies are particularly delightful.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.680]   - I had the experience of seeing you light up
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.620]   when you ran into the puppy.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.780]   - And you did, and I'm still buzzing
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.500]   from that short interaction with the puppy downstairs,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.620]   the way we're in our puppy.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.260]   It's just that, I don't know why,
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.700]   but I just delight in animals of most all kinds,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.060]   not a fan of reptiles, sorry, reptile fans, so much,
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.300]   but I just drive so much energy from it
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.520]   and it felt like life energy
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.500]   and the way the animal is sort of intentionally scattered
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.900]   is amusing to me as compared to the dog
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.300]   that he will eventually be,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.420]   which is going to be more linear in his thinking.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.020]   It encapsulates so much of the other things I love,
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.620]   like brain development, et cetera.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.580]   Anyway, I highlight those examples
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   because there's nothing passive about it.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.620]   It's pure delight and joy for me
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.580]   and it intersects with other delights and joys.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.980]   And I think that as you describe agency and gratitude,
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.020]   peace, contentment, and delight in these generative forces,
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.100]   as well as other forces that exist in us,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.760]   I think it's really critical that people understand
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.220]   that these are not states that you sit down
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.900]   and place yourself into,
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.640]   although perhaps one could through reflection or meditation
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.840]   or waking up from a really great night's sleep,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.960]   things of that sort,
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.620]   but that these are things
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.220]   that we can find ourselves awash in
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.420]   if we are doing the right things.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.980]   And those things can oftentimes be very challenging.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.740]   So assuming I understand
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.020]   the way the model is spelled out correctly,
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.980]   I'm more and more delighted at the fact
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.560]   that this is not just accessible in one domain,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.540]   but is accessible in many, many different domains
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.680]   for everybody, right?
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.260]   This is not something unique to my experience,
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.320]   even though I give examples from my own life,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.620]   but that we really all do have access to this
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.700]   if we're looking in those cupboards, those 10 cupboards,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.880]   and asking the right questions.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.900]   - And to maybe comment even a little further
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.580]   on the experience of you and the dog, right?
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.860]   So it was an experience of delight, right?
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.980]   And you enjoyed it and brought a sense of peace
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.700]   and contentment, like all of that happens, right?
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.220]   But think about what that's linked to,
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.700]   like I believe there's a strong sense of agency in you
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.860]   that you are enacting.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.140]   There's a strong gratitude in you that you're enacting.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.660]   You're handling your life in a way.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.380]   And also for all of us,
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.060]   good things always come with good fortune,
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.820]   but it comes with our strivings and our achievements
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.260]   that you're in a place to delight in that, right?
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.620]   If you're unhappy, like, "I don't like what I'm doing.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.340]   "I'm angry, I'm frustrated," right?
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.540]   Then there's no room in you to find the delight, right?
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.640]   And the delight that you find is also very much linked
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.420]   to the generative drive, right?
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.140]   It makes me think of how you loved and nurtured Casello,
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.960]   right, so you have it in you to love and nurture a dog,
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.060]   and you have done that in a really wonderful way,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.380]   and that generative drive is part and parcel
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.440]   of the delight you feel when you see a dog,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.580]   because you love dogs and you think about nurturing,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.060]   and it all comes together.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.660]   The agency and the gratitude expressed as verbs
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.100]   puts you in a position to have that sense of delight,
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.180]   which is so intertwined with your generative drive,
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.420]   with a sense of caretaking,
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.520]   a sense of creating the beyond self,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.760]   because although you enjoyed and loved Casello,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.260]   you enjoyed and loved his happiness, right?
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.260]   So it all comes together, and I think it's interesting
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.300]   because in some ways it's a simple example,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.380]   but like, that's life.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.920]   You know, life has its big moments,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.740]   but so much of our lives are the smaller moments
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.700]   that link together, and I think that smaller moment
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.140]   becomes a big example.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.140]   - Well, I appreciate that you mentioned Casello.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.700]   For listeners of this podcast
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.740]   that have tuned into early episodes,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.380]   Casello was the source of the background snoring.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.840]   For those of you that haven't, you can go check.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.700]   He was a 90-pound English Bulldog Mastiff
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.040]   who had many skills, the best of which was snoring.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.320]   [laughing]
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.140]   So in addition to the generative drive,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.700]   which is something that we certainly want
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.700]   to talk more about today, you mentioned these other drives,
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.220]   aggressive drives and pleasure drives,
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.180]   and much of what we're talking about today
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.100]   is going to be where people can go wrong
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.840]   or where people struggle.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.460]   We are also, of course, going to go deeply
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.820]   into where people succeed, and in particular,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.420]   where people can ask questions of themselves,
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:45.020]   in particular, what is working for them and why
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.500]   as a route to understanding how to sift
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.060]   through those cupboards and understand what's not working
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.580]   and why and come up with real actionable answers
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.140]   and then the ability to move forward.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.340]   So if you would, could you tell us a little bit more
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.540]   about drives generally?
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.480]   Like, you know, when I hear drives,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.000]   I can't help as a neuroscientist, but default to,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.520]   okay, the dopamine circuit or the endogenous opioid circuit
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.620]   or the serotonergic circuit, but, you know,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.660]   how do you conceptualize drives within us?
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.500]   And then perhaps you could tell us
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.920]   what the nature of aggressive drives
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.580]   and pleasure drives and generative drives.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.020]   - So the concept of a drive, the definition of a drive
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.500]   is something that's intrinsic to humans.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.100]   So we could look at it as a motivation, right?
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.700]   I mean, we don't just lie on the ground
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.660]   and do nothing until we passively die, right?
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.740]   So something is going on inside of us that is driving us
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.260]   to do something other than that.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.260]   And historically, the thinking in the field arising
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.660]   from early psychodynamic principles,
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.980]   the theory in the field that has really dominated the field
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.760]   either directly or indirectly in so many ways
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.820]   has been that there are two drives within us,
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.140]   that there's aggression and pleasure.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.140]   And again, these are just words, right?
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.020]   So we could apply many, many words,
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.340]   which is why, of course, we wanna define
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.820]   what that means, right?
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.460]   So aggression, even though we're using that word for it
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.260]   because the word for it is commonly used, right?
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:27.260]   But it means sort of forward, active engagement, right?
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.380]   So a good, healthy amount of aggression
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.940]   using that word for the drive
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.540]   would be a strong sense of agency, right?
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.020]   So too little aggression can be a problem, right?
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.560]   Then the person isn't bringing themselves to bear, right?
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.500]   So there's too little in the way of self-determination,
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.980]   forward movement, empowerment, agency, right?
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.580]   And in the same way, too much of this drive
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.180]   becomes actual aggression.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.380]   So the idea that I want more,
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.040]   and if I can't get it in certain ways,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.340]   I'll just take it, right?
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.460]   So it starts to become what we more map
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.460]   to the word aggression,
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.620]   which would be something negative in most cases.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.020]   - Like a desire or a tendency to harm.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.640]   - Sure, as aggressive drives get higher,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.280]   which you see why they're in us
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.600]   because let's say we're defending ourselves
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.100]   or you're defending a family member, right?
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.200]   Or like an entire family, right?
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.500]   Then it makes sense to have high levels of aggression
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.120]   if your family is threatened, right?
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.860]   So those drives are in us
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.280]   with potentially those high levels for a reason,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.740]   but we certainly access very high levels of aggression
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.980]   without the indication of preservation of life
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.220]   or preservation of safety.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.020]   So the thought is that's a drive in us
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.320]   and that gets us up and off the ground, so to speak, right?
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.020]   And that the other drive then is pleasure,
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.080]   which again, doesn't just mean
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.800]   that we all wanna be hedonists, right?
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.300]   So pleasure could be even the pleasure
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.660]   of relief and safety, right?
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.020]   Like we're all back in the cave together
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.140]   and we roll the stone in front of the door.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.660]   Ah, we're safe.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.600]   Throughout human development,
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.140]   pleasure comes in a lot of ways.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.020]   It can come through the pleasure of food or other people,
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.500]   friendship, romance, sex.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.940]   There are a lot of ways we can achieve pleasure.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.660]   It can be relief of things that are unpleasant,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.540]   relief of pain, but there's a drive towards this in humans,
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.840]   which again, really does make sense.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.620]   And too little of it, again, can be problematic
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.160]   'cause the person then isn't motivated to sort of seek things
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.560]   because they're not anticipating or don't receive
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.900]   gratification and too much of a drive for pleasure
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.400]   can also create problems.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.080]   So we can kind of see how these two drives,
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.580]   like, okay, they get us up and off the ground, so to speak.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.400]   But the question is, do they explain everything, right?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.280]   And it's a very important question
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.040]   because if they explain everything,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   then there's not really, there's not room
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   for behaviors and choices that are beyond the self, right?
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.460]   There's not an explanation for the person who,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.820]   I'll give you an example of a person I've taken care of
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.740]   who's just a very strong swimmer,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.040]   knows how to swim, has swam throughout his life,
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   who was in a place, I saw video of it,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.940]   where there'd been a hurricane
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.180]   and the waves were so frightening.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.220]   They were just huge, this huge surf.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.360]   And there were people who had gotten dragged out
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.740]   and you just see him, he runs into the water, right?
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.060]   He runs in and he goes and he was really at risk.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.200]   He needed to be saved himself, but he saved them.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.940]   And I do not believe you can explain that
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.060]   through these drives.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.940]   I don't think you can say, well, he was aggressive.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.840]   He wanted to go and do something
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.480]   that was imposing himself on the world,
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.880]   or he got pleasure in thinking,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.560]   ah, I'm strong enough to go do this.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.700]   I mean, I think we're really gyrating,
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.060]   we're contorting ourselves, right?
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.220]   In order to explain it that way.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.740]   If we think there's a goodness in that man's heart,
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.200]   like I know there's a goodness in that man's heart,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.040]   I know him, right?
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.860]   And that goodness sees him in the moment
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.640]   and he knows that maybe he can save them.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.100]   Maybe he can't, he's not sure, but maybe he can.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.980]   So the next thing you know, he's in the water.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   And I think things like the love and nurturing
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.740]   of other people, of children,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.060]   love and nurturing of animals, of plants, right?
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.460]   Like there are things inside of us
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.760]   that we can't explain with those two drives.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.880]   And I think they have led to a very sort of darker way
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.520]   of just conceiving of humans.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.380]   You know, I think it's a reason why now, you know,
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.520]   you look at us in the modern day and age,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.220]   we come at humans through the lens of pathology, right?
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.360]   I mean, there's a very, very thick book
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.780]   that if a person is assessing another person,
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.820]   you know, is thinking about like,
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.420]   okay, what numbers in that book apply, right?
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.080]   Which is like, that's not the way to go
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.040]   about understanding humans.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.600]   And I think if we just think there are those two drives,
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.660]   we're not doing justice to humans, right?
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.980]   One, I think it's not true.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.060]   I think it's evident that it's not true.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.840]   And then if we're framing it in a way that's not true,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.780]   we are not appropriately respectful of humans.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.560]   And if we come from what I believe to be the truth,
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.780]   that there is a generative drive in us,
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.620]   a drive for the beyond self,
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.580]   a drive to make things better,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.740]   whether it has anything really directly to do with me
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.020]   or not, and as with the other drives,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.980]   you know, there can be more or less in people,
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.020]   you know, combination of nature and nurture.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.500]   You know, what genetically is in us,
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.640]   a predisposition, you know,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.180]   based upon the genetic lineage that comes down to us
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.260]   and the recombination.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.080]   And now we're a unique person with a unique set of drives,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.860]   but they are impacted by the genetics.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.380]   And then they're impacted by life experience,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.660]   a more strongly formative life experience, right?
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.660]   So the younger the person,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.340]   the sort of deeper the impact of events,
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.620]   they have nurturing versus abuse, right?
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.800]   On the array, on the relative weighting of drives
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.720]   within people.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.900]   But ultimately we get to these three drives
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.740]   and how they're functioning in a person
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.540]   being a way of understanding and assessing
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.660]   like how healthy or not healthy the person is.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.580]   And then we look back to those 10 cupboards, right?
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.860]   For the answers, if we're finding things that we don't like,
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.300]   those drives are out of balance
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.540]   and here are the problems they're causing.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.900]   So very, very concrete issues, right?
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.880]   Of problems in people's lives.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.260]   We can look and see where is that out of balance?
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.500]   And if it's out of balance,
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.460]   there's something in those pillars
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.060]   that are not in the right place.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.160]   We can then go back and look in all those cupboards
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.560]   for like, oh, where do we dig to find the answer, right?
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.200]   We learn things, we bring things more into balance, right?
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.260]   So the pillars are in a healthier place.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.180]   And then what sits on top of it
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.580]   is you use the word geyser, right?
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.860]   The geyser that then comes up
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.540]   and floats everything on top of it
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.820]   can do that in a healthy way.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.260]   - Yeah, during episode one,
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.120]   we touched on some of the similarities
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.740]   between understanding the self
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   and building towards a healthy or healthiest version of self
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.220]   where agency and gratitude
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.820]   are these states that are being expressed.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.480]   And one of the themes there was this idea,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.940]   people perhaps want to be healthy
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.300]   so that they live a long time,
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.040]   but presumably they also want to be healthy
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.380]   so that they can walk up flights of stairs,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.380]   pick up their kids, move objects, not get injured,
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.980]   perhaps even do sport.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.200]   And of course, some people want to be healthy
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.220]   for aesthetic reasons as well.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.700]   And if we were having a discussion about physical health,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.060]   we could address the major pillars there,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.220]   which were items within the cupboard.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:50.540]   Most people want some ability to have endurance or stamina
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.380]   to walk some distance or maybe even run some distance.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.900]   As I mentioned before, walk up a flight of stairs,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.360]   have some strength, some degree of flexibility,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.060]   certainly some mobility,
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.360]   maybe even dynamic mobility, et cetera.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.500]   And in order to address those or improve upon those,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.180]   they could look in those covers and say,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.380]   well, how much running, swimming,
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.180]   long form cardiovascular exercise am I doing per week?
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.300]   How many steps am I taking per day?
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.000]   How many times a week do I lift objects
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.620]   that are slightly heavier
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.580]   than is comfortable for me to lift, et cetera?
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.340]   It's very tangible, very concrete.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.980]   Here, you're making the psyche and the self
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.740]   and mental health very much concrete
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.900]   in some of the same way,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.260]   saying there are 10 cupboards that one can look in.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.780]   And these drives, as you refer to them as generative drive,
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.620]   aggressive drive, and pleasure drive,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.740]   you'll probably tell us in a few minutes,
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.940]   can be expressed to varying degrees in different people
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.340]   and how that shows up and what that looks like.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.140]   And I just want to frame this in people's minds
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.780]   as very similar to addressing whether or not,
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.020]   okay, if somebody can run very long distances,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.680]   but they're always having aches and pains
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.340]   or they feel weak or they are weak.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.540]   There are good reasons for that.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.500]   They're overemphasizing one form of exercise.
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.880]   The expression is more along the lines
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.700]   of endurance and stamina, not strength or vice versa.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.480]   The power lifter who can lift 750 pounds from the floor
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.560]   in a deadlift, but walks up two flights of stairs
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.820]   and is belly breathing and has to stop
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.700]   at the top of the stairs.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.440]   It's obvious in the physical realm.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.240]   It's slightly more cryptic or more cryptic
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.940]   in the psychological realm,
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.600]   but here it's becoming concrete for us.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   So I think it's very interesting and very ironic, right?
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.700]   So the field that I'm in, the field of psychiatry
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.600]   has historically wanted to be sort of part
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.160]   of the rest of medicine or like the rest of medicine.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.660]   And what I believe it's ended up doing
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.220]   is glorifying a taxonomy, right?
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.540]   Glorifying a category, a mechanism
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.300]   of understanding human beings.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.100]   So in the way that if, okay,
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.180]   if I'm practicing general medicine
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.340]   and you come in and you're congested
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.060]   and I determine like, oh, you have bacterial sinusitis,
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.380]   right, so now I've made a diagnosis
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.140]   and now I know what I'm gonna do about that, right?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.200]   So the, okay, I'm gonna prescribe an antibiotic.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.360]   Now, the thought comes in of like what antibiotic, right?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.620]   But the identify sinusitis, now you need an antibiotic
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.840]   is like kind of how medicine works, right?
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.640]   So the thought was psychiatry
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.040]   is gonna categorize everything, right?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.680]   So we'd say, okay, I've listened to you.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.460]   Like, ah, I know your number or your numbers, right?
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.380]   And then once I've given you the numbers,
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.320]   now I know what to do.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.220]   I prescribe this medicine, that medicine,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.240]   these many sessions of a certain kind of psychotherapy.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.660]   And like, that doesn't work, right?
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.020]   It doesn't work in mental health.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.040]   It may, I mean, it's not that it never works,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.700]   but if you're gonna try and understand people,
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.980]   like it's different, the problem of self,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.620]   like if I have a lack of confidence in one area of life
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.900]   and not in others, right, that's a significant issue.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.560]   It is not like bacterial sinusitis where then, you know,
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.420]   okay, arrow goes to prescribe antibiotic.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   And I think what is ironic is that this route of approach,
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.660]   right, actually does bring psychiatry or mental health
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.080]   into line with the rest of medicine, right,
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.700]   which is why you can make that parallel.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.980]   And, you know, it fits well, right,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.800]   when you're making the parallel to physical health
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.340]   and to, I wanna be healthy.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.820]   Okay, what are the components of that?
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.500]   What am I doing to achieve that?
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.760]   If something's not the way I want,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.900]   let me go back and look at those components.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.600]   I mean, it may be, because it's more tangible,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.340]   it's sort of essentially easier to comprehend, right?
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.160]   'Cause it's more concrete.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.600]   But I don't, in a sense, see it as cryptic,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.940]   just less obvious, right?
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.220]   But if we go and we look at it and we say,
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.000]   oh, like that really makes sense, right?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.980]   And in a sense, it makes sense that it makes sense, right?
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.860]   If there's a mechanism of understanding
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.660]   that applies to lots and lots of things
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.120]   that are more concrete,
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.420]   why would a similar kind of mechanism,
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.960]   like understand what the components are,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.940]   understand what's built on top of them.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.640]   Like this, I believe, is how psychiatry
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.540]   actually fits with the rest of medicine,
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.700]   not by glorifying a taxonomy,
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.020]   but by coming through the lens of understanding.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.240]   - Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.940]   And I think that what's so reassuring
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.500]   is that both in terms of creating physical health
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.780]   across the various domains of heart health, lung health,
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.180]   endurance, strength, et cetera, cognitive health,
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.140]   as well as mental health is verbs.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.780]   It comes back to action items
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.080]   that we each and all should engage in
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.900]   in order to arrive at the states and ways of being
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.300]   that we all want to be in, right?
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.880]   We want to feel healthy, look healthy, et cetera.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.460]   We want to be happy, right?
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.940]   I know very few people who don't want to be happy.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.660]   I mean, certainly there are people who give up,
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.060]   but we'll talk about that today and routes out of that.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.420]   But at the end of the day,
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.180]   it's all about looking in those bins,
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.420]   asking specific questions,
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.500]   and then moving forward in specific actions
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.740]   to get to the place of empowerment, humility,
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.340]   agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, delight, et cetera,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.320]   as opposed to simply using words and understanding
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.700]   to arrive at insight and then stopping there
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.340]   and expecting everything to change.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.260]   And I think that's where a lot of people are confused
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.880]   about psychology, therapy, and psychiatry.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.080]   And as you mentioned, psychiatry has its own shadow
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   if you will, within it, where the use of drugs,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.480]   which certainly can be very useful, even life-saving,
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.080]   oftentimes is seen as a fix-all
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.680]   that somehow could reorder everything within the cupboards
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.140]   and make the recipe just right.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.680]   When in fact, as we'll talk about today,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.320]   that is generally not the best route.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.640]   But again, with the understanding
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.840]   that drugs can be very powerful tools.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.920]   - They can play a role, right?
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.040]   - But it's important we understand what role is appropriate
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.180]   for them, and that's where we often go astray.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.280]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.960]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, AG1.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.360]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.920]   that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.960]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.120]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.880]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.800]   and the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.840]   or generally twice per day is that it's the easiest way
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.040]   for me to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.320]   minerals, probiotics, and fiber that I need in my diet.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.440]   Now, of course, it's essential to get proper nutrition
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.200]   from whole foods, but most people, including myself,
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   find it hard to get enough servings
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.720]   of fruits and vegetables each day,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.920]   and especially to get enough prebiotics
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.280]   and probiotics to ensure gut health.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.300]   As you may know, your gut contains trillions
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.740]   of little microbiota, the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.680]   which establishes critical connections
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.640]   with other organs of your body to enhance brain health,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.400]   as well as to support your immune system
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.360]   and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.740]   One of the most common questions I get is,
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.580]   if you were to take just one supplement,
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.820]   which supplement would that be?
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.840]   And my answer is always AG1, because by taking AG1,
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.020]   I'm able to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.280]   minerals, and probiotics that I need
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.520]   to enhance my mental health,
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.020]   physical health, and performance.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.440]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.800]   to claim a special offer.

[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.960]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.660]   to claim this special offer.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.000]   So as we move forward here in defining
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.380]   and helping people gain, for lack of a better word,
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.920]   agency over their own mental health and self-understanding,
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.120]   and defining for them what action items to take,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.840]   you know, I'd like to ask you about some of the things
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.240]   that I observe in the world and hear a lot about,
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.960]   in particular from the audience of this podcast.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.600]   You know, it's obvious to me that people vary
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.320]   in terms of their level of aggressive drive,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.100]   pleasure drive, and presumably generative drive as well.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:12.860]   One common question is, how do I become more motivated?
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.720]   Right, you know, and of course,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.240]   that opens up a bunch of other questions,
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.760]   like are people afraid of failure,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.040]   and that's why they're not motivated,
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.800]   are people afraid of success?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.960]   Is that why they're not motivated?
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.920]   Is there some underlying childhood trauma
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.720]   or unconscious process that's driving that fear and so on?
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.760]   But if we were to take the psychiatrist perspective,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.560]   your perspective, if someone comes to you and says,
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.420]   you know, I just don't really feel like trying.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.600]   It's, you know, school's hard,
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.320]   school loans are, you know, are excessive,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.640]   which is true, by the way, you know,
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.040]   it's not even clear that with a degree I can do much,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.720]   you know, or I had a series of failures in the work domain
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.000]   or in the relationship domain,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   and they're just feeling weighed down
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.280]   as if it's not worth trying, you know,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.240]   what does that tell you in terms of where to look?
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.200]   And what does that tell you in terms of their drives?
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.480]   I mean, do we conclude something
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.640]   about their innate level of aggressive drive
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.080]   or their pleasure drive or their generative drive?
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.880]   I mean, I think there are many such people out there,
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.760]   and then we'll consider some other kind
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.560]   of phenotypic examples.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.160]   - Right, so it's a great example
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.400]   because sort of any good clinician, right,
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.920]   could hear that story and then have thoughts about it,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:35.320]   right, that could and would hopefully be helpful, right,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.880]   without necessarily referring to drives, right?
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.720]   So I think you can anchor any set of assessments,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.600]   any evaluation, any attempted understanding to drives, right?
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.200]   But it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.360]   So for example, you might ask that person more questions
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.500]   about what they're doing, how they spend their time,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.560]   because you're telling me about someone
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.600]   who's not getting enjoyment or gratification
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.160]   out of anything, right?
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.680]   And that then becomes of interest to me, right?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.060]   Is there something this person does enjoy, right,
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.260]   or something they'd rather be doing?
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.040]   Like, did they go to college and take on a bunch of loans
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.840]   because they thought that was better,
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.040]   because they thought they were gonna do something
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.560]   that now they actually don't wanna do, right?
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.060]   Or that opportunity isn't there and now they're frustrated.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.480]   Like, what is inside this person
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.840]   that might seem different than that?
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.760]   And again, the answers could be complicated.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.840]   It could be maybe that person enjoys what they're doing,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.940]   but the cost of living where they are is so high
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.280]   that they still feel miserable.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.840]   There's a sense of privation.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.960]   And then that gets back mapped to like,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.080]   I'm not getting any pleasure out of anything, right?
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.420]   So the answer could be as simple
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.900]   as you strategize with the person of,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.820]   for example, does a person like that move,
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.780]   move to a different area?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.380]   So there's so many ways of looking at this
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.600]   and so many ways of understanding this,
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.920]   but you're describing someone to me
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.080]   who is kind of really complaining
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.100]   that nothing is feeling good, right?
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.660]   Nothing's providing a sense of enjoyment or of pleasure,
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.500]   right?
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.340]   So I would probably be interested in that first
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.800]   and think maybe the pleasure drive
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.960]   is higher than what's being fulfilled, right?
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.620]   Maybe the pleasure drive is low
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.120]   and that's an issue in and of itself,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.980]   but we sort of learn those things, right?
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.300]   Maybe the aggressive drive is low
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.960]   and if that person just put a little more energy into it,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.300]   right, like they could be in a different place, right?
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.580]   So you try and help the person understand themselves
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.380]   so that you can make change.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.360]   And again, that understanding doesn't have to be anchored
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.620]   to the drives, but I do believe the drives
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.040]   are at the root of all understanding
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.720]   because if you sit with that person
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.360]   and you talk to that person,
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.400]   then you're gonna be able to understand
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.700]   what is out of balance, right?
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.660]   Either in the actual array of the drives
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.920]   or in how they're being experienced.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.740]   Because again, if you have a high pleasure drive,
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.160]   for example, and it's not gratified, right,
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.540]   like that represents a problem, right?
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.620]   - Yeah, what about people who can experience some pleasure
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.880]   or can keep busy, say for instance,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.380]   on social media or playing video games?
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.300]   And I should also say, perhaps it's bringing them
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.900]   to a place of peace, contentment and delight.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.580]   But in some sense, it's not really generative, right?
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.160]   I'm not going to cast judgment and say that video games
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.060]   and social media are all a waste of time.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.260]   I mean, I'm on social media trying to provide value
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.900]   to people and learnings and I derive value and learnings
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.260]   from other accounts as well.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:40.780]   But there are these milestones, if you will, in life.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.360]   I mean, not that everyone has to go to college
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.800]   and get married and have a family.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.380]   I mean, there are a lot of different paths through life
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.820]   that I would consider successful.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.100]   But in some sense, there are milestones.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.260]   Like we want to move forward.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.980]   There's this phenomenon nowadays of a lot of young people,
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.780]   so-called failure to launch.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.540]   Like they're not leaving home
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.420]   or they're not finding a vocation.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.620]   They're not feeling as if they're good at anything
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.340]   or they have the sense that unless you're going to be
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.260]   like top 1% in something, it's not worth trying.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.820]   But they can still find what most people
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.860]   would describe as pleasures.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.380]   Like they might enjoy food, maybe a little too much.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.900]   They enjoy alcohol, maybe a little too much.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.140]   They enjoy social media or video games,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:25.980]   maybe a little too much.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.460]   And I say a little too much because it's providing
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   more or less a sync or a reservoir for their aggressive
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.900]   and pleasure drives that's not moving them forward
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.420]   in the standard milestones of life.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.180]   I hear about that a lot.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.100]   I see that a lot.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.620]   So it's a slightly more complex phenotype
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.900]   than described before as just simply the amotivated
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.580]   or non-motivated person.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.580]   But what do you think of the phenotype I just described?
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.020]   - Because we're unique, right?
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.980]   Each person is unique, although we fit categories, right?
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.820]   So there are categories a person there could fit
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.500]   that could be different from what I'm saying, right?
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.300]   But I think most people just say on balance, right?
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.700]   What is most prominent, right?
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.900]   I think what is most prominent in that situation
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.260]   is there's something out of balance
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.660]   in the generative drive, right?
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.420]   And what you see a lot of times
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.020]   is the person has a generative drive in them
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.100]   that's higher than their ability to realize that drive.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.180]   The generative drive then is frustrated.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.340]   So I'll give an example, and this is a real true story
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.540]   of a person who had worked very, very hard,
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.060]   gone to school for a long time,
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.180]   and it achieved a very high-paying job.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.660]   And that was the goal, right?
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.220]   It's a prestigious job, it's a high-paying job.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.460]   And the person for a while was doing quite well at it.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.460]   And things went relatively rapidly in a negative direction.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.020]   So maybe for a little while the person's doing okay.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:06.340]   Then the person becomes very negligent of themselves
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.220]   and their environment when they're not at the job.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.540]   So the house is a mess, things are dirty,
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.420]   the person is wasting time with things.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.460]   So this is a person who enjoys,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.820]   it wasn't exactly video games, right?
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.340]   Let's say it could have been, right?
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.940]   Well, enjoys them to a certain degree
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.260]   and can really gain pleasure
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.020]   and feel good about the time spent, right?
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.860]   But starts spending too much time, right?
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.860]   Now what was pleasurable
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.140]   starts becoming a distraction mechanism, right?
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.980]   And then what that transitioned to
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.820]   was overuse of alcohol, right?
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:42.020]   So now you have either something that is actually destructive
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.220]   and was negative to job performance, right?
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.260]   Towards the person,
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.580]   this wasn't a person who was drinking a lot before,
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.700]   and this is a person who was miserable
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.740]   when they were drinking,
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.260]   or they were sort of wasting their time, right?
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.780]   And were aware of all of this.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:58.140]   Well, there's a very clear problem,
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.380]   which is that that person had no interest
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.980]   in what they were doing, none whatsoever.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.460]   It felt like the majority of waking hours
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.340]   were spent in an automaton-like way,
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.700]   but being awake and aware of the tedium of it,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.780]   the frustration of it.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   - The professional side.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.140]   So they essentially had very little intrinsic curiosity
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.020]   or desire to do the job that they were successfully doing.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.420]   - Right, which comes out only after exploration,
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.260]   because it seems like,
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.700]   well, what's going on with this person?
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.740]   This person has a good job
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.540]   and their life was going really, really well,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.300]   and they're doing well financially.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.300]   And is this person trying to now overly indulge themselves?
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.780]   Like, is that why they're drinking?
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.940]   What's going on, right?
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.660]   And what you feel is that this person
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.540]   had a strong generative drive.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.780]   And it wasn't met one little bit by what he was doing,
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.980]   which was creating such frustration inside
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.020]   that the person was either taking himself online
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.860]   or doing something that was punitive and self injurious.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.220]   And like, this is a real story.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.100]   The person exchanged that job for a job
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:09.020]   that paid a 10th of what the job they had paid.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.900]   And the change in the person's life was amazing.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.300]   Like, I didn't know this guy could smile, right?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.140]   He became happy.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.700]   He loved what he was doing.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.140]   He sold the larger house, bought a smaller house,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.140]   kept it beautifully.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.060]   Like, he was happy, right?
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.900]   That's what he needed to be happy,
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.140]   because then the generative drive in him,
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.420]   he loved what he was doing, right?
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.460]   Gets enacted, it gets expressed.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.780]   And then other things can come then into line, right?
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.940]   He's not being over-aggressive towards himself
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.700]   and drinking too much, you know,
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.300]   because he's saying, oh, to hell with you,
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.860]   to the world around him and to himself, right?
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.260]   He's not taking something that serves a purpose in his life.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.140]   Like again, if the example had been video games,
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.260]   it would be like, yeah, great.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.140]   You enjoy doing that X amount of time
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.500]   and like go do that and get gratification from it,
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.540]   as opposed to then over-relying on it.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.460]   And then it's not providing gratification.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.500]   It becomes a distraction.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.700]   So those things came back into balance in his life,
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.140]   but there had to be the understanding.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.740]   And I think there's a lot of that in people
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.340]   who have a generative drive in them
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.860]   that they feel is frustrated by a world around them
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.300]   that isn't cooperating.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.140]   Now, do I think we can understand that and change that
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.020]   in the vast majority of people who are in that place?
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.660]   Yes, but it has to be looked at first, right?
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.060]   'Cause when it's not always that,
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.460]   it's just that a lot of the time, right?
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.380]   So it has to be understood, what is it in that person?
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.580]   And then how do you go back to those pillars
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.940]   and look at what's going on that the person is in that place
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.260]   because the world can bring us a lot of difficulties, right?
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.120]   And that person who now is saddled with a lot more loans
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:38.960]   than they expect.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.620]   Like I have tremendous compassion for that
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.180]   and sympathy for that, like that's real, right?
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.300]   So people can be up against a lot of things
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.780]   and that's just one of them, right?
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:51.360]   But it doesn't mean that life can't be okay, right?
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.700]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.940]   But the person has to feel that there's some way,
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.100]   they have to understand enough about themselves
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.460]   is okay, this is what this is.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.740]   And I kind of see what this is and why and how I'm here.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.460]   And from there, I can start to plot a route
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.160]   to something that is better because yes,
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.720]   we have our difficulties and we can have a lot of them, right?
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.160]   But for the vast majority of us,
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.300]   it's not like they're not surmountable.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.280]   We have to just understand them.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   And let's say if that person goes and says,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.600]   I'm gonna get some help.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.480]   And they go and someone says, okay, right,
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.800]   you get 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.400]   And you're trying like, how can that person
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.120]   think differently than they'll feel differently?
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.340]   Look, cognitive behavioral therapy has its place, right?
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.760]   But it's not gonna solve that, right?
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.280]   Like that person needs to understand something
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.200]   about themselves, not redirect their thoughts
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.680]   to better places, right?
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.960]   So if the person gets a reflex,
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.000]   because that reflex works well for the system, right?
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.700]   It reflex works well for the system
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.680]   that's treating that person, for the medical system,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.960]   the insurance system, that person isn't helped one bit,
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   right?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.840]   And maybe a medicine can help, right?
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.520]   Maybe a medicine helps to just take down the anxiety
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.660]   and the tension in the person.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.720]   Then the person can sort of think more about it.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.660]   And truly, medicine did help this person
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.960]   because the idea of leaving the job,
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.680]   I'm leaving the prestige, I'm leaving the money,
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.500]   is that okay to do?
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.140]   Like it generated a lot of anxiety
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.180]   and it helped to kind of bring the temperature down
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.640]   a little bit of that so that he could think about it,
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.560]   engage in therapy, ultimately navigate
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.800]   to where he wanted to be.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.300]   Then we could back away from the medicine.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.420]   So like medicine has a role, but if he just got medicine,
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.520]   I mean, what are the odds of that helping?
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.600]   Like zero, right?
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.680]   'Cause it's not gonna make the answers
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.680]   unless somehow the person feels a little bit better
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.440]   and figures it out on their own.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.660]   I mean, it's not how it works, right?
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:38.660]   So medicine has its place, but a kind of therapy
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.880]   that recognizes the limitations of medicine
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.240]   in most situations and is designed
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.880]   to really help the person understand,
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.940]   like that's what we need.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.400]   - Well, the example you gave is a spectacular one
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.560]   because as you mentioned, medication had its place,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.040]   perhaps even redirection of thought in some sense
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.280]   had its place because as I recall,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.660]   under the pillar of function of self,
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.720]   one of the key items is salience,
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.800]   what we pay attention to internally or externally,
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.600]   what our internal narratives are.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.520]   But in staying with the example of this individual,
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.280]   again, as a phenotypic example for everybody
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.880]   to learn something from,
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:22.760]   the asking of better questions about oneself
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.200]   is really what leads to the understanding.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.080]   So like better forms of inquiry, right?
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.060]   To me, these are the better forms of inquiry,
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.440]   better questions are really the cardiovascular exercise,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.280]   the strength training, the flexibility training,
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.960]   the mobility training, coordination training
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.900]   of physical health just translate to mental health, right?
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.920]   - It's so interesting, right?
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.640]   Because think about it in the example I gave,
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.980]   both the therapy part through the system, right?
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.680]   The CBT has a place, right?
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.280]   And the medicine part also had a place.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.440]   So both of those things have their role,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.200]   but if we build the whole story of like,
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.800]   this is what this is and this is how you're going to be
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.840]   helped around those things,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.640]   we don't help that person at all.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.320]   In fact, we ultimately, if you take on balance,
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.680]   you take all comers, we end up doing harm.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.600]   - Well, in some ways, if we stay with the analogy
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.360]   of physical health, it would be like the person
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.600]   who wants to get in shape and then they get a,
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.960]   I'm not picking on Peloton as a brand,
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.360]   but just a stationary bike and they pedal every morning
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.300]   and they lose weight, their blood pressure goes down,
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.260]   they're doing better.
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.480]   But then at some point, we know with certainty
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.160]   that if you just do the same form of exercise
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.400]   over and over again, like sooner or later,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.600]   you're going to get overuse injury.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.800]   So then there's like the lower back piece and another piece
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.920]   and you become out of balance, right?
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.480]   There's just, but I guess this is stealing
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.280]   from the Lance Armstrong book,
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.920]   but it's not about the bike, right?
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.640]   I mean, it's not about the bike,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.680]   it's about the elevation of heart rate.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.520]   It's about the whatever other healthy activities
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.520]   go along with exercising first thing in the morning
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.720]   and all the things that you're not doing
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.580]   as a consequence of exercising in the morning.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.440]   So it seems to me that these better lines of inquiry
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.680]   as the path to better mental health,
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.800]   a better life that sit under these pillars
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.240]   of structure of self-function of self are really the key.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.220]   - So in this example, right?
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.440]   The parallel that you made is even more dramatic, right?
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.960]   It wouldn't be the stationary bike, right?
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.980]   Because a stationary bike is achieving a lot of ends, right?
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.240]   It would be more like telling the person,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.260]   you know, you should walk more briskly
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.760]   when you're going upstairs, right?
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.800]   Like that's a good idea,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.120]   but that's not gonna make the change, right?
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.660]   So the idea that some CBT, some medicine makes sense,
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.020]   it's more like that, right?
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.480]   It's not that walking more briskly up the stairs
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.000]   isn't a good thing, it's that we can't build the story
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.600]   around your whole health is gonna change
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.880]   based upon that.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.360]   And then that's a problem then if the person thinks
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.160]   just walk more briskly up the stairs and you'll be healthier
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.320]   because when it doesn't work, now they've failed, right?
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.960]   And this gets used a lot in mental health.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.440]   That person failed this therapy, failed that medicine, right?
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.720]   And I think it's so also ironic
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.580]   because that's often what the person internalizes.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.580]   Well, they failed because we set them up 100% for failure,
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.280]   right, because we took things that have their role,
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.760]   at least potentially have their role
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.360]   and we built the whole story around them
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   because that story is convenient for the systems
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.080]   that are providing the care.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.400]   It's convenient for the healthcare systems,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.260]   it's convenient for the insurers.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.840]   CBT packages very nicely and you could see how,
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.400]   you know, if you start changing thoughts
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.320]   and how they make you feel like, you know,
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.960]   you can get some movement on the surface
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.120]   even if there's no movement underneath, right?
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.560]   And again, I'm not saying CBT is bad,
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.120]   but to see it as the whole answer
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.040]   guarantees failure in so many situations.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.300]   Same thing with the medicine.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.640]   If you build the whole story just 'cause it's convenient
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.440]   and by and large medicines are cheaper than people, right?
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.160]   So you can prescribe medicines very reflexively.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.640]   Psychiatrists with 15 minutes with a patient
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.180]   that they can't then see back for a couple of months,
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.480]   like how does that go well?
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.960]   The answer is it only goes well
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.300]   the way a broken clock is right a couple of times,
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.060]   you know, twice a day, right?
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.600]   I mean, look, sometimes it goes well
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.840]   where it just somehow it works out
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.680]   and that person could do a little bit of therapy
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.800]   in 15 minutes and choose the right medicines,
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.200]   but by and large, we do those things
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.280]   because they're convenient for the systems
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.800]   even though that's why like people don't get better,
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.120]   like we think they would.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.440]   That's why they stay in systems.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.680]   That's why they come in and out of emergency rooms.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.520]   That's why they're not able to stop the drugs
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.760]   that end up only being stopped when the person dies.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.480]   Like this happens all the time and we don't stop it
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.780]   because we're coming from a perspective that is so limited.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.480]   It's not saying let's take a step back
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   and look, can we really like help someone?
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.380]   Can we really help that person understand?
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.380]   Can we help that person make change?
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.600]   Which ultimately would be, of course,
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   so much better for the person
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.680]   and so much better for society,
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.960]   but is also better if we just look at bottom line dollars
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.140]   and cents, right?
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.400]   Because the short-term view of it is cheaper today
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.320]   to have a psychiatrist at a 15-minute appointment
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.720]   reflexively prescribe a medicine, that is cheaper today.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.780]   Is that cheaper across time?
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.820]   When that person is utilizing more resources
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.640]   or they're in and out of emergency rooms,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.120]   it's so short-sighted which fits with many ways
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.060]   in how our society works, right?
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.160]   That we want gratification and we want gratification rapidly.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.240]   That's why a person would accept that their problems
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.120]   could be changed by a medicine, right?
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.720]   We're kind of conditioned that way.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.160]   - Well, and then of course there's the cost we don't see
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.640]   which is that person doesn't get the opportunity
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.680]   to express their generative drive
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.480]   and so the consequence of that is incalculable.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.120]   - Right, yes.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.780]   And if we take a step back and we look at that,
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:02.280]   I think that what we will see is that we have,
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.960]   it's not quite like painted ourselves into a corner,
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.760]   but it's like the idea that if there's a beautiful tapestry
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.680]   that's the size of the wall, right, that you can see that
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.680]   only standing back from it, right?
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.540]   I mean, this goes back, I think a couple thousand years,
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.980]   like this sort of thought and idea,
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.600]   but if you come up too close to it,
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.280]   then you can't see what it means anymore.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.380]   And we're up so close to it that we're thinking,
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.320]   well, okay, how could one parameter change
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.280]   and can this person get a 15 minute visit
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.320]   sooner rather than later?
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.920]   Or how about this medicine instead of that?
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.640]   And then it's like our noses are right up
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.360]   against the tapestry and we don't see that.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:40.040]   We're not doing right by individual people
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.720]   a lot of the time.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.560]   And we're not doing right by society,
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.200]   which then if you stop and think about it,
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.200]   we're not doing right by us,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.620]   because any one of us could be in that position.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.880]   And many of us have been in that position
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.800]   being on the other side of things and really needing help
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.840]   and needing to understand.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.860]   So any of us can be there.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.100]   So if we're failing a lot of individual people
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.680]   and we're failing the society,
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.360]   it doesn't matter who we are listening to this,
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.420]   ultimately we're failing ourselves.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.560]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.880]   and acknowledge our sponsor Eight Sleep.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.520]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.340]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.160]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast and elsewhere
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.300]   about the fact that getting a quality night's sleep
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.920]   on a regular basis is the foundation of mental health,
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.460]   physical health, and performance.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.840]   When we're sleeping well, everything goes better.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.200]   And when we are not sleeping well or enough,
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.720]   everything in terms of mental health,
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.080]   physical health, and performance
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.060]   gets far worse very quickly.
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.920]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.320]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.920]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.800]   you need your core body temperature to drop
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.400]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.200]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.360]   you need your core body temperature to increase
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.860]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.120]   That all becomes very easy
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.180]   when using an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.080]   because it allows you to program the temperature
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.440]   of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.380]   and towards the end of your night when you wake up.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.320]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.880]   over two years ago, and it immediately
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.800]   and persistently improved the quality and depth of my sleep.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   And as a consequence, I wake up feeling far more refreshed.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.000]   I have enhanced mood, focus,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.460]   and alertness throughout the day.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:16.760]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.560]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.660]   to save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.280]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.560]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.380]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.120]   Let's therefore talk about what does work, you know?
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   And again, placing on the shelf
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.160]   the fact that medications can help
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.540]   and CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, can help,
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.120]   but they are just but two components
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.520]   of a much larger picture.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.880]   The map that we described briefly
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.440]   at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.580]   and that is, by the way, available as a downloadable PDF
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.800]   in the show note captions
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.420]   if people want to look at it visually,
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.920]   and that was described in a lot of detail in episode one,
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.460]   which I hope people will take the time to listen to
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.420]   because it's so rich with depth of understanding,
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.160]   and I'm certain everyone will learn
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.180]   a ton about themselves and others
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.360]   simply by listening to your words.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.020]   I'm absolutely certain of that.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:17.840]   That map provides essentially a description
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.800]   of the bins, the cupboards to look in
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.360]   to arrive at better answers,
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.620]   and even the sorts of questions that one might ask.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.740]   If we could just talk about that
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.880]   in the context of the example that you gave
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.540]   of this person who made this really incredible choice
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.660]   to move away from this higher paying job.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.840]   They were overindulging in certain maladaptive behaviors,
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.980]   and again, we will use this example,
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.200]   but this example is but one of an infinite number
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.240]   of examples that we could use
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.080]   of a person who's in a struggle, right?
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.260]   They're doing something that's not working for them,
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.880]   and they're also not doing things
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.420]   that they know they ought to be doing, okay?
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.360]   This is important for people to understand
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.500]   because there are gonna be people out there
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.840]   that are thinking, oh, like this poor guy,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.860]   like he's making tons of money, poor him,
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.700]   but he was experiencing deep lack of satisfaction,
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.380]   so it could have been the reverse example,
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.060]   like the person isn't in a job
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.060]   that brings about enough wealth for them to thrive,
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.300]   'cause there are financial realities to life.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.900]   So it's just one example, right?
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.100]   But it's a good one, I think,
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.340]   because the person left the money, right?
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.680]   So it's like, well, what would make you leave that, right?
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.080]   And it's, well, what would make you leave that
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.200]   is if you're miserable in the situation with that
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.160]   and you're happy in the situation without it.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.000]   - Right, so it's about leaving misery and finding happiness.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.040]   So if you'd be willing to share with us
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.000]   a little bit of your mindset during those sessions,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.800]   meaning the sorts of questions you asked him
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.540]   about the structure of his self
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.140]   or to reveal the structure of his self
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.280]   and the function of his self that allowed the both of you
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.160]   to eventually set him down this far better course,
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.680]   what's better than moving away from frustration
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.660]   and overindulgence and maladaptive behavior
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.600]   to deep satisfaction, peace, contentment, and delight,
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.780]   and to become a generative human being?
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.900]   - Right, so we can look in each of those 10 cabinets, right?
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.780]   So let's say we look in the unconscious mind cabinet.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.360]   There's not much there, right?
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.760]   When the person was growing up,
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.380]   it was very clear that having more money
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.900]   and having a job that impressed people
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.580]   was an important thing.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.820]   He internalizes some of it, so some of it's unconscious,
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.340]   but by and large, he's aware of it.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.660]   - And then that was real to you how?
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:30.380]   You know, you would ask him a question about,
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.080]   you know, like, tell me about your upbringing,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.260]   and he would say, yeah, like, you know,
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.500]   money was important to my family,
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.020]   but I always felt like we had, you know, enough.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.760]   He wasn't super wealthy, but had enough.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.080]   And so when you say there wasn't a lot there,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.480]   do you mean that there was no kind of like X marks the spot
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.720]   or like blinking red light, like, whoa,
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.660]   there's something really in his unconscious mind
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.920]   that's in his way, do I have that right?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.120]   - Well, more because it was conscious, right?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.960]   So he was aware that it was very much like beat into him,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.640]   right, like this is the only way to be okay, right,
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.120]   is to have a prestigious job that makes a lot of money,
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.040]   right, but he's aware of it.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.160]   If he weren't aware of it,
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.940]   we have to bring that to light, right?
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.780]   But he was aware, he's like, look,
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.560]   it has a big impact on me.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.680]   It makes it hard to step away.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.020]   Like, I know I don't really care that much about the money,
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.600]   but I also kind of do, you know?
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.560]   - Sure, money, I always say money can't buy happiness,
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.040]   but it certainly can buffer certain stressors in life.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.960]   I mean, nobody, you know,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.760]   sometimes you hear people who have a lot of money saying
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.040]   like money can't buy happiness,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.960]   'cause you know, there are a lot of miserable rich people,
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.240]   but it's like, you know,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.600]   it's very different to have two night nurses
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.580]   to take care of a baby than to be the person
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.560]   who has to stay up all night taking care of a kid,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.300]   especially, or a single mother versus a mother
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.200]   that has a partner who's willing to pitch in, right?
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.040]   You know, you just can't compare.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.280]   - And while that's absolutely true,
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.200]   in this case, we're just looking at money as money,
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.280]   like as an end point, right?
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.720]   The idea that no matter what, right,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.480]   how secure and safe, like is more money better, right?
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.700]   And he had an intrinsic overvalue of that, right?
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.640]   So it made it harder to step away from it
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.800]   because he was overvaluing it.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.660]   He knew he was overvaluing it just in and of itself,
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.520]   not even for what it gets you, right?
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.360]   But for the psychological meaning of it, right?
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.520]   Then we look at his defensive structures.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.840]   If we look in that cupboard,
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.160]   you see that they've really shifted, right?
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.760]   They shifted from healthy places.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.040]   Now they're sort of twisted and distorted,
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.760]   and he's doing a lot of denial, a lot of avoidance,
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.120]   a lot of rationalization, right?
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.100]   He's enacting a lot of aggression towards himself,
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.080]   and he's doing a lot of projecting, right?
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.340]   He's harming himself with the alcohol.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.820]   He's punishing himself.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.000]   So his defensive structure, it can be healthy.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.920]   We know that because it was healthier, right?
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.080]   But then we see that it is so twisted.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.680]   So we learn a lot from that, right?
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.600]   A lot is conscious in this person.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.420]   The defensive structure can be healthy
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.120]   because it was healthy, but it's-
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.940]   - Eventually it was healthy.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.720]   - Well, it was healthy before.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.560]   - I see.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.380]   - It was healthy before.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.360]   So you know that it can be healthy again, right?
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.320]   He has it in him to have healthy defenses.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.240]   They just started getting away from him
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.260]   as he felt less and less satisfied with his job
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.860]   and more and more angry with himself
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.920]   and more and more miserable.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.460]   - This is a really key point for me
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.560]   and everyone else to understand.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.240]   Throughout the years of high school and college and friends
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.260]   and things of that sort, I would hear this.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.800]   Like, I used to be really good at fitness, or I used to,
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.880]   you know, if I had a dollar for every time someone said,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.800]   you know, you should have seen me in high school,
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.680]   you know, like the person who lets themselves go
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.120]   and arguably is very busy with professional duties
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.060]   and family duties.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.080]   And you can understand why their time is more compressed
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.400]   than it was when they were in high school.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.680]   But nonetheless, you hear these sorts of things
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.520]   all the time.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.980]   Like I used to have this sense of like, I could do things
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.880]   or that like things could work out or that,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.220]   and then it's as if there was a previous version
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.140]   of themselves that is completely atrophied
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.660]   and the new version of themselves
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:57.100]   or the later version of themselves, rather,
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.700]   it just simply like doesn't have access to that anymore.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.320]   - Right, and that's the impact of trauma.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.740]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.000]   - Whether it's big trauma or it's a big event
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.760]   or it's multiple things like,
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.240]   oh, the world, this isn't rewarding me.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.500]   I'm trying, the world's not rewarding me.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.100]   I'm trying, the world's not rewarding me.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.800]   Then people become dispirited, right?
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.180]   Demoralized, right?
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.700]   So it's the trauma of that that takes away
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.780]   the sense of self, the sense of agency.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.260]   Like I thought I could do things before.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.420]   Now I don't think I can do things, right?
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.740]   But nothing has really changed in me.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.980]   I mean, that's a problem, right?
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.180]   And it's a problem the vast majority of times
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.940]   it's born of trauma.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.180]   - Does that necessarily mean early childhood trauma
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.260]   or I suppose it could be later life trauma.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.000]   I mean, one of the things that I like
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.140]   about what you're saying so much is that, you know,
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.820]   you the psychiatrist hears,
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.620]   I used to be able to do something well or feel well.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.820]   And that's like, it sounds like is a signal.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.420]   It's really a beacon of health
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.200]   that still exists in the person,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.660]   but that they're out of touch with.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.780]   I think for most people, when they think about themselves
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.860]   or people who talk about how they used to be functional
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.820]   in some domain and they're no longer functional
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.140]   in that domain any longer,
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.260]   it sounds as if like things are fundamentally broken.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.580]   Like is this of a piece of them that was functioning
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.100]   like drifted out of their body and left, right?
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.020]   But I love the optimism, right?
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.540]   Because I think so much of what we're interested
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.320]   in covering today is not just what's not working and why,
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.180]   but also what's working and why,
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.300]   and what used to work and why.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.340]   And the idea that, you know, within these cupboards,
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.720]   there can be the discovery of problems.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.100]   Clearly that's why one goes to the cupboards, right?
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.140]   As we're defining it.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.340]   But that there are a lot of answers.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:46.420]   There are the ingredients for success
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.220]   already exist within us.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.060]   - Right, especially if we know
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.060]   we've had that ability before, right?
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.300]   Because we know that we had it before.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.100]   So think about in this man,
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.260]   he felt that he couldn't make change.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.980]   Like now he's stuck, right?
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.820]   Like I got a lot of things done.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.740]   I was able to get myself into this school and achieve this
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.360]   and you know, and then get this job.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.920]   Like he could do all of those things,
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.500]   but now he feels like he can't do anything
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.020]   to make himself happy.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.420]   So like we know he could do that.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.340]   He had a strong sense of agency.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.080]   He does it now, right?
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.620]   And like people often do, they feel a sense of loss.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.780]   Like naturally I've had this happen in myself.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.860]   Like it feels like something's cut out of you
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.900]   and there's something hollow.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.820]   I had that thing and now I don't, right?
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.600]   Hence the I'm broken, I'm hopeless.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.160]   The things that we hear over and over and over again.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.400]   So think about the shift in this person
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.140]   to like what's actually going on,
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.620]   which isn't that hard to discern.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.160]   We just pay attention to it.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.100]   So then if we run up the structure of self,
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.180]   we say, okay, not a lot of it is rooted
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.460]   in the unconscious mind, right?
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.840]   There are problems of overvaluing certain things,
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.200]   but they're in the conscious mind.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.600]   - He knows like in his household over dinner,
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.840]   it was, you know, dad or mom, you know,
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.920]   being proud of some dollar amount that they had achieved.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.260]   So that narrative exists and he's like,
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.000]   yeah, like money was a big deal in my family kind of thing.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.400]   By the way, I'm not speaking about my family,
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.300]   but rarely were there discussions about money.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.080]   There were discussions about other things, of course.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.560]   But in this hypothetical.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.400]   - And he knows-
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.880]   - Not a real patient, sorry.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.060]   - He knows he overvalues it, right?
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.880]   He knows it independent of what money buys
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880]   and what he needs and all that.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.080]   He just puts too much importance in money
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.580]   and he knows that, right?
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.000]   So, okay, they're conscious mind issues.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.960]   He's pretty aware of them
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.400]   and they're pretty kind of set in him.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.160]   Like those are the issues and they're there.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.400]   Okay, we learned that.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.560]   Then we go look at his defensive structure.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.680]   Boy, that's very, very helpful to talk about.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.720]   Wow, like you had a very healthy defensive structure.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.660]   What were you doing before?
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.500]   You had a lot of sublimation, right?
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.860]   - Could you explain sublimation?
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.840]   - Yeah, take anxiety, tension or something,
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.420]   something negative in the self or that could be negative
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.740]   and you channel it towards something positive, right?
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.080]   He channeled that energy towards learning, right?
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   He channeled some of the aggressive drive, right?
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.380]   Into a sense of agency that got achievement.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.720]   So, he looked and he said, right?
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   Those, that network, right, of defense mechanisms
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.700]   that comes up out of the unconscious mind
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.200]   was like looking pretty good, right?
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.100]   It was pretty clear.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.120]   Light was coming through it in a way that wasn't distorted.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.040]   And now we can look at,
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.760]   wow, things are pretty different now, right?
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.800]   As he's saying, no, it's okay.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.680]   Like, what do you mean?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.320]   I spent 10 hours of my weekend utterly wasting time.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.040]   And what's wrong with that, right?
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.480]   Or he's rationalizing even that he likes to drink
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.100]   when he doesn't because he so mattered himself.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.680]   Like the defensive structure now is twisted, right?
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.420]   So, we can say, okay, that's a big observation, right?
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.660]   And then the character structure, when we look at that,
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.060]   we find a person who's pretty good at figuring out
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.500]   and understanding things
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.200]   and coming right up to the precipice of change,
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.020]   but has a long history of then difficulty
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.660]   making the change, right?
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.380]   I know it and I'm on the verge of it,
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.460]   but I don't, I can't bring myself to do it.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.300]   Like that's in his character structure.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.720]   - By the way, it's such a common thing.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.840]   I mean, people that know better, know they know better.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.620]   Sometimes you almost have to wonder
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:10.260]   whether or not it's like a medication in the pocket.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.100]   Like they could take it if they wanted to,
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.320]   that might even give them some comfort,
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.100]   but they just don't do it.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.380]   They just don't engage in the proper actions
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.740]   to move their life from one place to the next.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.180]   - Right, and if we look then at the level of strivings,
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.500]   like he does know what he wants.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.140]   Like he wants a feeling of contentment,
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:26.980]   it's really what he wanted,
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.520]   was a feeling of contentment,
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.980]   a feeling of like, I'm taking good care of myself.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.100]   I'm doing something that's of value, I'm enjoying doing it.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.660]   Like he wanted those things.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.780]   And even when we talked more,
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.160]   he had ideas of what jobs would do that.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.020]   In the beginning, he said he had no ideas.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.920]   What he really meant that he said to me,
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.620]   but was also saying to himself is I have no ideas
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.880]   of jobs that would meet these requirements for me
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.700]   that pay as much as the one I have, right?
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.360]   So, but within him, which we got to,
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.860]   where he knew that there were jobs
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.780]   that would make him happy,
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.160]   he just had to get over that they were lower paying.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.300]   So think of what we learn about that.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.700]   There's nothing lost in this man.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.500]   There's nothing cut out of him, but he's not damaged.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.460]   He's not hopeless.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.940]   And now he can understand that,
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.180]   that he understands himself actually pretty well, right?
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.380]   And his conscious mind is apprehending pretty well
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.060]   what's going on and where he wants to go.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.700]   But boy, as he hasn't taken good care of himself,
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.980]   the defensive structure gets sort of warped
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:27.800]   and then it makes it a lot harder to take care of yourself.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.980]   It starts making other problems in life.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.900]   And he starts like feeling lousy about himself.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.800]   Like maybe I can't do much of anything, right?
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.380]   Why? Because work isn't going as well,
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.860]   because he's drinking too much
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.020]   and role performance goes down, right?
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.100]   So we can see that.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.000]   And then, you know, what's of most interest there
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.460]   is that there's a character structure
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.700]   that can come right up to the precipice,
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.240]   but not pull the trigger, so to speak,
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.580]   on what the thing the person wants to do,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.980]   because now we start getting, okay,
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.980]   an understanding of what's actually going on, right?
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.740]   And then if we look at function of self,
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.620]   let's look in those cabinets too, right?
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.180]   To help him be more aware of, there's an eye here,
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.820]   which he was pretty well aware of, but not enough.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.540]   Like there's a person here I'm shepherding through
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.060]   24 hours in the day, right?
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.540]   Like I am an eye and I'm aware of what's going on
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.900]   inside of me and it can make me happy
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.880]   or it can make me miserable.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.260]   Like let's be more aware of that.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.560]   - How did he go about doing that?
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.960]   - Because I find this first step
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.320]   within addressing the function of self, you know,
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.280]   self-awareness and really understanding
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.040]   that there's an eye, there's a me,
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.840]   and I'm moving myself through life.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.720]   I find this to be so interesting.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.240]   And on the one hand, kind of obvious, like, okay,
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.960]   there's an eye, there's a me, like tangible thing.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.680]   You look in the mirror, you see yourself,
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.140]   but at the same time, it's a bit abstract, I think,
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.480]   to me and to many people out there.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.720]   Like how does one go about building up a sense of self
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.920]   in a way that provides positive agency in the world?
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.000]   Is it to tell, you know,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.080]   we hear all the time about these like affirmations
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.520]   and I'm sure there are people who look at themselves
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.120]   in the mirror and say, you are enough.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.620]   And these, and I'm not making fun of these people, right?
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.840]   I actually have my own internal list that I tell myself
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.400]   on waking every morning,
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.360]   which has nothing to do with positive affirmation.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.100]   It's just actually defining the different roles that I play.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.600]   I don't know why this is useful to me,
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.240]   but I find it incredibly useful to me.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.280]   It reminds me who I am.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.320]   It also reminds or at least reassures me
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.140]   that I don't have any dementia yet.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:27.140]   So, you know, we'll see going forward, but hopefully not.
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.200]   But yeah, let's talk about this line of inquiry
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.260]   within the category of self-awareness that people can do,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.560]   regardless of whatever challenges they might be having
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.680]   or not having, what does that look like?
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.280]   And what do you think that accomplishes
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.400]   at the level of self-understanding
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.320]   and agency in the world?
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.120]   - So one way of looking at that is,
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.240]   and this is not the words I would use,
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.880]   but like what's pervading a person
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.420]   and sort of setting the stage, right?
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.800]   Which you can discern by inquiry.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.340]   So for example, in this case, the person,
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.260]   so there's a person, right,
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.220]   who would really not think this is okay, right?
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.920]   This person taking a job at 10% of the previous pay
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.360]   and the job has less prestige, right?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.040]   There's a person who would be very unhappy about that
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.960]   and very faulting of that and talk to this person,
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.440]   my patient, through the lens of it,
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.280]   he should feel shame for that.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.740]   That person's not alive.
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.980]   The person is not alive.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.060]   So one way of looking at it is,
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.240]   what master are you serving, right?
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.480]   And a lot of like the givens, right,
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   the automaticity in him was as if,
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.940]   like that person was alive inside of him,
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.880]   really telling him like how this wasn't okay,
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.040]   like he was fighting that, he wasn't aware that,
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.080]   hey, that's some other person's voice.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:42.920]   It was like, he's like,
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.800]   no, I'm very, very conflicted about this.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.520]   Actually, he wasn't very conflicted about this.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.420]   When he starts focusing on the I,
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.240]   like what do I actually think?
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.840]   What do I actually think?
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.880]   I don't care if I make 90% less, like I don't care.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.700]   My needs are met, I put some money away, I wanna be happy.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.400]   I'm not conflicted.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.040]   But in order to get there, we have to look at the I.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.480]   How much is the I at center stage, right?
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.080]   In all that, I don't mean in some way
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.640]   like paying too much attention to the self,
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.440]   but like we're all acting through the lens of the I,
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.280]   no matter what we're choosing, right?
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.920]   So to be aware of that,
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.920]   and do I wanna be impacted
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.600]   by the opinions of this other person?
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.640]   'Cause I can let someone else's opinions very much,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.260]   I mean, we all do, right, very much impact my thoughts,
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.080]   but I wanna kind of decide that.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.120]   Do I really value that person's opinions?
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.760]   I don't want them automatically inside my head
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.080]   telling me how I feel about myself.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.880]   - I can't tell you how many people I know
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.560]   come to me in a place of struggle,
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.160]   even though I'm not a clinician.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.880]   And as I listen to what they're struggling with,
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.240]   it's so clear that they know
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.200]   the best answer and route forward,
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.320]   but that they're dealing with some internal oppressive voice
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.200]   about whether or not they are a good person or a bad person,
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.760]   whether or not the choice they want to make
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.000]   is really a good choice at all.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.780]   Sometimes those voices are the voices of parents,
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.180]   you know, in these particular examples,
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:10.720]   or the voices of peers.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.880]   And so I think, if I understand correctly,
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.640]   what you're talking about is getting really firmly rooted
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.640]   in who a person is for themselves and what they really value
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.440]   and what they really know to be true for themselves
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.040]   and really trying to not necessarily quiet those voices,
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.200]   but see those voices truly as other,
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.440]   even though they come from within their head.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.680]   - Yeah. - Is that right?
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.440]   - Yes, yes, to stop and think, what voices do I want inside?
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.480]   So maybe I want the voice of a kind mentor
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.480]   who still held me to account for a very high standard, right?
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.540]   It's a good voice to have inside of me.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.160]   - I get a few of those and they, you know.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.960]   - Right, but what might not be a good voice
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.320]   is like say a not so kind mentor
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.760]   for whom you could never do anything good enough.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.960]   That's not so good.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.260]   Or maybe you take part of that and you leave part of that.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.740]   But the earlier and more formative the voices are,
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.460]   the more they're in our head automatically.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.760]   Like think about it, that man thought
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.240]   that he was deeply conflicted.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.460]   Absolutely, a hundred percent, like you're talking about.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.140]   And then he was, right?
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.320]   Like his experience was to be deeply conflicted,
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.780]   but when you go in and dig, there's actually,
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:19.140]   if you just dig and you get to like,
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.380]   okay, the I is gonna assess this.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.220]   He's not conflicted at all, right?
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.980]   Which is why then if you're coming up
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.540]   the function of self ladder, right?
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.240]   And you look at defense mechanisms in action, right?
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.400]   And what's on top of that, salience, right?
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.000]   Now is when it creates an immediacy, right?
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.800]   So defense mechanisms and actions
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.780]   sort of inform the process and say,
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.040]   hey, the defenses are shifting to denial, acting out, right?
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.080]   And that's what sort of gives us a time horizon.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.560]   Like this thing, this is not gonna be okay, right?
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.120]   That if he kept down this path,
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.800]   what was very clearly gonna happen,
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800]   you don't have to roll the tape forward that much
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.200]   to see that he's gonna lose his job, right?
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.680]   He's gonna feel very ashamed of that.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.720]   Like a bunch of negative things are gonna happen.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.520]   So it helps the person apprehend
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.760]   that like there's something going on here.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.400]   Like I'm changing, right?
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.100]   Because like in some way I'm thinking now that it's okay
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.780]   that I'm wasting 10 hours on something
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.520]   that I could really enjoy if I spent 90 minutes on it.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.020]   Like, well, I'm kind of losing
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.140]   a little bit of perspective there, right?
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.000]   So it adds a sense like it frames the situation, right?
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.160]   And the salience of it.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.400]   - Could you elaborate a little bit
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.200]   on this defense mechanism in action of acting out?
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.260]   You know, I think we covered in episode one
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:28.300]   and I'm sure it will come up several times more
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.580]   during today's discussion about things like denial,
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.740]   projection, displacement, et cetera.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.140]   Those defense mechanisms
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.160]   seem to have their own intrinsic definition,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.300]   but you know, acting out is something
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.920]   that we hear more and more about these days.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.180]   Like they're acting out.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.260]   What is acting out?
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.460]   Is it acting out of some conflict?
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:56.460]   Is it trying to, you know, demolish a struggle
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.600]   by going and doing something else?
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.800]   - Yeah, we can think of it as by and large
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.440]   an unhealthy manifestation of a lot of aggression,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.640]   which could be a very high aggressive drive
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.060]   or an aggressive drive that's not too high,
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.880]   but is then furthered, its powers furthered
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.780]   by a negative situation, right?
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.500]   Say like this one, right?
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.920]   Because the acting out,
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.980]   what was going on here inside of this person
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.100]   is he was very, very mad, right?
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.900]   And this isn't a person who expressed a lot of anger, right?
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.420]   So he had outlets for it, right?
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.100]   He wasn't going and running 10 miles, right?
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.340]   This was all inside of him.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.480]   He wasn't getting it out in one way or another.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.720]   So what he starts doing is he starts acting out the anger.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.180]   Now he's angry at the world around him
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.400]   because he's unhappy in it
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.100]   and it's not giving him more choices.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.660]   Now, of course, this is about him
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.460]   and not the world around him, right?
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.680]   But he's feeling an anger towards the world
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.220]   that won't cooperate, right?
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.420]   And he's angry towards himself, right?
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.300]   Because like he can't make himself happy.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.100]   Like look at all of this, look at all that he did
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.100]   and look how miserable he is, right?
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:02.100]   So a way of acting out then is the drinking, right?
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.000]   Because the drink is to hell with the world, right?
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.980]   You think I shouldn't be drinking at night
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.380]   and come into work, come over, I'll do it anyway, right?
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.200]   To hell with the world.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.300]   It's a way of snubbing his nose at the world, right?
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.060]   He's also snubbing his nose at him, right?
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.460]   To hell with me, right?
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.940]   The guy who now doesn't come across the way he did before
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.420]   because I'm showing up at work,
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.700]   not in the responsible way I showed up before,
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.960]   but in a way it's a little disheveled,
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.420]   function is lower, to hell with me, right?
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.820]   So form of self-denigration,
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.460]   like let people think worse of me, right?
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.340]   'Cause why, because I'm so mad at myself
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.940]   that I think it's justified, right?
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.140]   And then there's also the inviting of,
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.340]   hey, if I really have an addiction problem here,
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.980]   I lose my job, it's like, fine, I deserve that too, right?
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:42.260]   Like, you know, there's an acting out against the self
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:44.820]   that if the person doesn't stop and look at that,
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.660]   that can become true, right?
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:47.820]   'Cause that person didn't really,
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.500]   wasn't built to say to hell with the world and with me,
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.700]   or to not even understand it,
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.980]   what's to hell with the world mean?
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.180]   It also means to hell with me
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.160]   and it's not good for the world or me, right?
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.760]   But he was able to understand that
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.400]   because we would look at like, wow, what's shifted in you?
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.460]   This is a person who did a lot of sublimation before
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.820]   who now all of that's going into acting out.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.380]   So they're not taking negative energy
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.980]   and doing something good with it.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.460]   They're taking negative energy
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.020]   and doing things that are bad with it.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:11.860]   Why?
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.620]   Because there's too much, there's a lot of negative energy.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.920]   It's overwhelming everything else.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.780]   And then it's going down these pathways
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.940]   where the unhealthy defenses are always beckoning us.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.660]   Send the energy down here.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.780]   It's easier to avoid than it is to face something
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.200]   and figure it out, right?
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.660]   It's easier to just act out
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.740]   than it is to hold what's inside of us
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.800]   and then think about why it's there.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.620]   So the unhealthy defenses are beckoning us.
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.220]   And for him to see,
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:41.260]   hey, you have had a healthy defensive structure.
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:44.340]   Like you can be healthy again, you're not broken, right?
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.480]   But to also see the way these defenses are going
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.200]   is bringing real risk to your ability to even be happier.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.440]   You get further down the shame and loss path.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.680]   It can be hard, sometimes impossible
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.280]   for the person to get back.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.240]   So it sets the stage like this is very, very important
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.500]   to what these defenses are, how they're being enacted.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.300]   And for him to be able to see that like,
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.800]   oh, this could be healthy, but it's not now.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.800]   - Yeah, these slow degrading forms of acting out
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.520]   and self-sabotage and sabotage of others,
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.600]   I think are the particularly dangerous ones
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.680]   because they're slow.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.400]   And sometimes the change is imperceptibly slow.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.800]   And then one day somebody arrives at a place
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.040]   where, as you said, they unfortunately can't get back
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.520]   or it requires going into residential treatment
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:42.360]   or things that really, big departures in order
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.560]   to get back into life.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.880]   And I would never wish for somebody to choose to act out
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.400]   by driving off a cliff instead.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.300]   But there are other forms of acting out
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.920]   that immediately wake people up.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.120]   But it seems like people don't often select those.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.460]   They select these more subtle forms of acting out
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.960]   where they don't get caught
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.640]   or no one's calling them out on it
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.360]   because plenty of people have five or six drinks
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.840]   at happy hour, right, as opposed to 50, right?
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.040]   So it's slow self-sabotage
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.120]   as opposed to immediate self-destruction.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.400]   And again, we're talking about alcohol,
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.300]   but we talk about food, video games, social media,
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.520]   arguing with spouse, I mean, all of these kinds of things
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.620]   that build up over time to eventually deliver people
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.940]   to a place of real problems.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:32.960]   I'm curious for this particular individual you worked with,
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.740]   sounds like that's not what happened.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:37.680]   They started this process of self-inquiry
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.140]   around self-awareness.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:43.300]   And did you see that the salience,
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.400]   that is what they paid attention to internally
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.600]   and externally immediately shifted
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.980]   and the defense mechanism of acting out
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.020]   immediately dissolved?
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.400]   I mean, what was the kind of contour and time course?
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.440]   - There was less.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.560]   If we're looking in the cabinets,
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.820]   there's a lot in the defense mechanisms and action cabinet.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.280]   There's not as much in the salience cabinet
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.320]   because this is the major thing on his mind.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.900]   Above all else, he was having intrusive thoughts about it
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.220]   and his self-talk was about it,
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.280]   but we kind of already knew that,
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.660]   just like we knew it was in the conscious mind.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.760]   So if you think where's the money at,
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.580]   it's not as much in that realm because he's aware of it.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.480]   If he thought, "Oh, this isn't bothering me very much."
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.320]   And then he said,
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.500]   "Well, all his internal dialogue is about it."
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.360]   Then like, okay, there's a lot to achieve there.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.400]   But just as he brought a lot that was unconscious
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.160]   into the conscious mind, was aware of it, it was salient.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.120]   There's less to do there, right?
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.260]   Because the things to understand and change
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.660]   are not residing so much there.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.940]   - For people that are no doubt,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.320]   everyone is thinking about their own internal processes
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.080]   and where they could ask better questions
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.380]   and arrive at better answers to help themselves along.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.380]   Perhaps you could elaborate a little bit more
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:01.440]   on this salience covered under function of self.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:05.660]   To me, salience is what's most apparent.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.040]   And as you talked about yesterday and again today,
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.520]   there's this internal narrative,
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.640]   like what's on my mind often, or what kind of jumps to mind.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.840]   I've started doing this recently
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.460]   based on our discussions here.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.600]   And I've noticed that under different states of arousal,
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.120]   and here I'm talking specifically about sleepiness
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.920]   versus alertness type arousal.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.960]   Like when I wake up in the morning
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.280]   or when I'm tired in the evening,
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.000]   where my mind is at, where it defaults to,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.400]   and what I'm paying attention to throughout the day,
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.740]   is that just asking myself to notice,
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:45.240]   and I've certainly noticed some patterns.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.380]   For instance, I've noticed that anytime
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.160]   my overall state is elevated,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.080]   more alertness or in the middle of exercise,
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.400]   my mind goes to some not so pleasant thoughts.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.040]   And it's interesting to me.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.720]   It's like, wow, this is strongly correlated
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.700]   with states of internal arousal that are healthy.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:05.440]   Exercise within a limited frame is,
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.960]   or exercises in general, if done in a healthy way,
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.440]   is healthy.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.440]   And when I'm sleepy, those thoughts never come about.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.620]   When I wake up in the morning,
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.020]   certain thoughts tend to leap to mind, other thoughts, no.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:19.640]   So sort of categorization of different types of thoughts,
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.360]   depending on my internal state.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.400]   Is that the sort of line of inquiry
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.840]   that you're suggesting or describing here?
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.280]   - Yeah, I think it's quite half the picture, right?
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.880]   'Cause half the picture would be
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.280]   what's going on in your mind
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.160]   when your mind is sort of at rest, right?
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.560]   What is then starts playing itself right in your mind, right?
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.120]   The other side of it is what comes to the fore
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.520]   when there's a lot of competition for attention, right?
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.920]   So I'm sort of making this up,
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.400]   but the idea that if he stubbed his toe really badly,
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.880]   he'd still be thinking about this, right?
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.960]   'Cause it has so much power.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.320]   Now, again, maybe if, God forbid,
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.280]   he has a badly broken bone, there's a lot of pain,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.440]   like he's gonna think of that first, right?
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.740]   But it takes a lot of other stimulus
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:04.360]   to be more salient than this, right?
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.140]   So you can look at what's coming in your mind
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.480]   when your mind is sort of free and open.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.280]   That's very, very important and relevant.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.460]   And then what's winning out
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:12.480]   when there's maybe a high arousal state
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.640]   and a lot of competition for attention.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.540]   - That's very helpful.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:22.340]   Again, I think that along with this self-awareness piece,
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.480]   the asking of oneself,
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.260]   what is happening in my mind
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:33.660]   when I'm in different states or throughout the day?
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.300]   And as you're describing now,
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:40.020]   also including when there are other things
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.620]   available to think about.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.340]   Like, does that include how often I'm distracted
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.780]   by a particular thought?
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.100]   Like how many times throughout the day
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.300]   my mind goes from the conversation
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.700]   I might be in to something else?
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.980]   - Yes, yes, yeah.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:54.880]   - Does it hijack your attention?
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.580]   You know, there's one way of putting that.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.300]   - A lot of people mentioned to me
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.220]   challenges with intrusive thoughts.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:06.500]   What can be done about those intrusive thoughts
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.940]   or is it simply a matter of paying attention
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.700]   to the fact that they're there
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:14.500]   and then thinking about the origins of those thoughts?
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.860]   - Right, absolutely.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.620]   One example, you could have intrusive thoughts
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.220]   because there's trauma in your background,
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.420]   maybe very clear trauma
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.540]   that you're not facing and addressing,
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.900]   and then you have intrusive thoughts and say, I'm not safe.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:28.980]   Okay, go look for what's still in the unconscious mind
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:30.740]   or when it comes out a little bit,
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:33.120]   you push back into the unconscious mind.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.440]   That would be, it's a very different scenario
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.940]   than like in this case,
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.080]   this man was having intrusive thoughts
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.980]   about his job situation, his overall situation,
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.460]   and it made sense that he was having those intrusive,
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:47.220]   they were markers of the acuity of it, right?
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.800]   Of like, you have to do something about this
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.620]   or something very bad is gonna happen.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.580]   So the intrusive thoughts there, this has made sense, right?
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.180]   Like this is not going well
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:59.500]   and your mind is sort of forcing you to pay attention to this
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.700]   because time really kind of is of the essence,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.640]   you're at real risk now.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.660]   So intrusive thoughts can be anything from,
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:08.820]   as they often are, they can be markers of something
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.840]   that is traumatic, something that's underneath the surface,
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.820]   something that is really bothering us that we shoved down,
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.620]   that's making guilt, shame, distress, vulnerability.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.820]   That's very often the case,
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.400]   but sometimes intrusive thoughts are a marker of like,
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.700]   oh, right, that's a thing to pay attention to.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.900]   - And once we identify the intrusive thought,
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.920]   I mean, how do we eradicate it?
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.480]   I mean, how do we work with it?
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.880]   I mean, we're talking about trauma now, you know,
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.140]   of course it might map back to a childhood experience,
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.260]   some internal narrative,
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.260]   but is there some roadmap for moving intrusive thoughts
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.380]   from a place of intrusive and disturbing
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.180]   to simply there and kind of meh?
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:55.100]   I mean, it'd be wonderful to hit a delete switch,
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.620]   but obviously we don't work like that.
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.100]   - Let's take a look if we could at this example, right,
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.740]   which is a little bit different.
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:04.120]   If we run through this example of the person in the job,
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.300]   because then we should talk about trauma-driven
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.300]   intrusive thoughts, which is, I think in many ways,
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.020]   the biggest topic about intrusive thoughts.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.500]   But think of this person here, if we go up from salience,
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.660]   we look at behaviors, right?
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.520]   And behavior actually now is very, very important, right?
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.540]   This person is drinking.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.460]   They're still going to that job they don't want.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:26.700]   They haven't gone and interviewed for the jobs they want.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.060]   So we start looking at the behaviors
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.940]   that are making problems,
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.900]   the changes in behaviors that could make things better.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.060]   And then on top of that, we arrive at strivings.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:38.420]   And I think when I was talking about structure of self,
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.840]   I think at least one time I misspoke
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.980]   and said striving instead of self.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.000]   At the top of these pyramids,
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.720]   self and striving have a lot of overlap, right?
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:50.820]   Because if you're growing a healthy self
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:55.140]   out of the sort of top of the structure of self pyramid,
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.480]   then that self is gonna be aware of strivings
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.660]   and it's gonna be better able to enact them.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:03.060]   So his sense of self was shaken here,
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:05.940]   but he was aware of the strivings for a better life, right?
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.780]   So now let's see the roadmap.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.620]   It's interesting, right?
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.620]   'Cause the roadmap is his roadmap, right?
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.820]   If we look in those 10 cupboards,
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.720]   we come up with a roadmap
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.120]   and the roadmap doesn't have a spending very much time
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.000]   in like unconscious land, right?
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.760]   Because he doesn't really need that, right?
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.960]   If we look at what makes the difference for him,
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.560]   what did we do, right?
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.620]   We really cultivated the self-awareness,
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:32.400]   the I that is making decisions for him.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:36.320]   We looked at how his defensive structure had changed
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:39.040]   and the things he didn't want to be there now
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.680]   and the good things that were there before
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.340]   and how could he get back some of that?
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:45.700]   How could he trend back towards what was working before?
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.840]   So we start to really look at that
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.920]   and then we go from there really to changing behaviors.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.800]   Like it requires a behavioral change,
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.660]   which is not to walk up to the precipice
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:58.520]   of doing this each day, but to actually do it, right?
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.520]   Because it was very clear,
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.200]   all the vectors so to speak inside of him
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.760]   were pointing towards doing it
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.080]   and that that was consistent with the self being healthier,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.420]   that garden growing on top of the structure
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.780]   and the strivings then being realized.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:15.400]   So for him, that was the roadmap and the salience, right?
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.500]   Wasn't really part of it because the intrusiveness,
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.520]   the salience bias inside of him made sense.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.360]   And then like, of course it went away
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.960]   once he made the decisions, right?
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.240]   Because the intrusive thoughts of like,
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.520]   you have to figure this out, you have to figure this out,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.480]   weren't there anymore.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.320]   Along with the intrusive thoughts of,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.680]   you'll never figure this out, right?
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.280]   Like it goes away because he made the change,
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:39.160]   but he made the change 'cause we looked at self-awareness
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.600]   and we strengthened self-awareness,
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.360]   we looked at defense mechanisms,
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.680]   how they could be versus how they are.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.380]   We looked at the behavioral change,
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.900]   which was really necessary.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:50.100]   And then also referencing a character structure
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.100]   that has difficulty, right?
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.660]   Coming across the precipice, right?
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:57.480]   So we say, okay, that's a baseline characteristic of him,
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.860]   we kind of understand that,
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:01.820]   but how do we help him change the behaviors anyway?
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.120]   When he does that,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.520]   the self is in a better, happier, healthier place,
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.100]   the strivings are realized.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.940]   This person that stops drinking in the way they were,
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:14.140]   they start doing the enjoyment aspects of their life,
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:16.200]   they start doing them within reasonable bounds again,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.700]   they're taking care of themselves.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.460]   Person smiling and now think the generative drive
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:22.840]   is much more fulfilled.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:26.380]   So what comes on top of those pillars, right?
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.060]   Is that person has a sense of humility, right?
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.380]   Enough humility to say,
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.540]   I'm gonna walk away from this job.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.320]   It's okay that the people in the job will think I'm crazy,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.260]   how could you leave that?
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.460]   And like it triggers something in me in some way,
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.020]   but like, it's okay, right?
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.380]   Like I don't have to, you know, I'm not out there for that.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.580]   I'm not out there for the big thing
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:46.060]   that everybody is guiding.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.160]   I can have the humility to go to the job
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.500]   that I know makes a difference and feels good to me, right?
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   He's empowered to make change.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.560]   He's moving away from the disempowerment
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.580]   to the alcohol and the avoidance, right?
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.300]   So there's empowerment and humility.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.980]   And absolutely, if you talk to that person
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.180]   on the other side of it,
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.400]   like shortly as he was enacting it, right?
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.040]   Getting just to the other side of it,
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.820]   there was so much empowerment and so much humility,
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.500]   which were then brought to bear through a sense of agency
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.960]   that made the changes, right?
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.540]   That changed the job, that stopped drinking,
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.860]   that dealt with the people who thought negatively of it,
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.780]   right, through a sense of gratitude of,
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:23.640]   it's not awful that I'm gonna go make less money.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.780]   A lot of people said that to him, like, how could you do it?
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:26.740]   It was so terrible.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.520]   He's like, it's not terrible, right?
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.820]   I'm grateful, like, you know what I'm gonna do?
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:30.900]   I'm gonna go make an amount of money
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.820]   that that's all that I need, right?
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.400]   So it was like, that's what helps a person do that thing,
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.160]   and that's actually true, right?
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.920]   That's what mattered to him.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.440]   So an activated, an active, a verb sense of agency
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440]   and gratitude then leads him to the place
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.560]   where there was a peace, contentment, delight.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.040]   He was delighting in the job that he chose,
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.860]   and his generative drive was in accord with it.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:59.120]   You know, then we stopped at some point working together.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.480]   He didn't need me anymore.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.940]   He could always come back, but he didn't need me anymore.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.980]   And you look at how were those last sessions.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.980]   A lot of the last sessions were him, like in an excited way,
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.060]   telling me what he was doing, right?
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.800]   Like, oh, and then we did this, and like, I did this,
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.680]   I figured this out.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.400]   Like, he was so happy about it.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.560]   And you can see that man's generative drive,
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.680]   which naturally, naturally is quite high in him,
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.020]   but was being squelched, right?
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.020]   That brings him out of balance.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:26.560]   Now the generative drive was in quite a good place,
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.640]   and he had enough aggression or assertion, right,
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.000]   to go and do that job and to do that well,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.960]   and even enough to counter anybody
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.500]   who would still kind of rise up and say
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.800]   that wasn't a good idea.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.000]   He could counter all that.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.480]   He was getting pleasure from it.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.120]   He didn't need to seek pleasure by what?
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   Not even pleasure because alcohol was pleasurable.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.280]   No, pleasure because harming himself
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.020]   and saying to hell with you, to the world,
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.720]   and to him was pleasurable, right?
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.780]   He's not getting pleasure that way.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.600]   He's getting pleasure in healthier ways,
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.040]   taking care of himself, doing the job he loves,
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.260]   doing his leisure activities.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.200]   Like, the man comes into balance,
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.960]   and then, like, life is good.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.640]   And we say, yeah, okay, come back in a couple months.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.200]   Like, comes back in a couple months,
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.680]   maybe in six months comes back one more time,
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.840]   I don't see him again.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.880]   That's great.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.040]   He totally doesn't need me again,
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.120]   and I atrophied, right, from his life.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:12.960]   Great.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.400]   That's the success state of it.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.760]   - He eventually arrived at being truly wealthy, right?
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:19.600]   - Yeah.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.400]   - With all the components of mental health
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.020]   and peace, contentment, delight.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:27.820]   As you describe his story, which is a remarkable one,
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.500]   it occurs to me that the narratives that we hear as children
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.420]   end up being so powerful.
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.260]   - Yes.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:39.580]   - And I'm sure there are people out there
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.940]   that receive such direct messages
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:44.120]   from their mother and/or father.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.520]   Like, you have to do this, you cannot do that.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.540]   But often, we get messages through observing
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.900]   and overhearing, right?
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:57.020]   The way that our mother talks about our father
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.060]   when he's out of the room.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:01.100]   The way that our father talks about our mother
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.020]   when she's out of the room.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.680]   And some of this could be nonverbal,
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.440]   like a rolling of the eyes or somebody saying,
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.580]   "Yes, yes," agreeing, and then they walk out
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.060]   and they just, you know, and kind of blowing them off, right?
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:15.860]   I mean, kids are, we are all so aware
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:18.360]   and integrating all of that all the time.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.540]   And I do think those messages get woven into us
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:22.860]   at a very deep level.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.860]   - Absolutely.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.040]   And then, of course, there are the conscious narratives
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.300]   that we build up as we go through,
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.240]   in particular, I think elementary and middle school
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.080]   and high school.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.020]   I mean, I can still remember a negative comment
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.780]   somebody made about a jacket that I was wearing
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.600]   in like the third or the fourth grade.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.980]   I forget everything else that happened that year.
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:42.260]   Remember that?
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.940]   Yeah, and I'm not, you know,
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.180]   I'm not insecure about the clothing that I pick, you know?
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.100]   I mean, obviously, it's a black button-down shirt.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.740]   I've had similar shirts since the first grade,
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.100]   just kidding.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.320]   But, you know, the fact that that's embedded
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:59.300]   in my memory systems is like just speaks to the salience
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.300]   of negative, of insults, basically.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.280]   It was an insult.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.140]   And I'm sure I've insulted plenty of kids
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.840]   coming up, you know, as a teenager and back and forth.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:14.580]   And so, but these narratives get so deeply embedded
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:17.380]   and the idea that one could pick a different path
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.100]   of vocation or like you'll miss the opportunity
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:24.500]   to be truly happy at a deep level based on these narratives.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.160]   I mean, on the one hand, it's obvious.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.500]   On the other hand, you just go like, whoa,
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.040]   this is not good.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.780]   This is a flaw in the design, right?
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.880]   And yet you're giving us a roadmap to understanding
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.700]   and to overcoming it.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.720]   - Right, let's say we take your examples
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.120]   and we look, they're great examples,
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.580]   and we look at them, right?
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.020]   The person making fun of the coat in third grade, right?
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.380]   We're assuming it hasn't harmed you.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.060]   It hasn't changed the course of your life, right?
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:52.900]   What does it tell us?
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.900]   It shows that negative stimuli are very salient, right?
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:59.320]   I'm sure you got a lot of compliments in third grade too,
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.160]   right?
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.360]   But it's the negative that stands out,
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.400]   which just shows that there's a salience bias in us
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.240]   towards the negative.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.700]   And that's probably about survival and threat sensing.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:12.160]   Like in some ways it makes sense around human survival,
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.300]   but it doesn't make sense around human trauma, right?
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.380]   So then, so you had given the example
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.420]   of what gets communicated to the child
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:23.420]   when say mother says something negative about father,
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:24.440]   when father's out of the room,
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:25.940]   father says something negative about mother
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:26.820]   when mother's out of the room,
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.340]   just to give an example, right?
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.560]   So children, because the complex cognitive mechanisms
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.980]   haven't been formed yet, right?
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.260]   The natural way that the brain functions
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.900]   is in a self-referential way, right?
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:43.020]   So the child generally doesn't have the capacity
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.780]   to say like, oh, mom and dad aren't really getting along
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.340]   well in this certain way.
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:50.820]   So when dad's not here,
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:53.860]   mom vents a little bit about something about him by saying,
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.660]   the child isn't thinking about that, right?
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.860]   Then what the child will often internalize is,
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.900]   okay, there's me and there's mom and dad,
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:05.100]   and mom says dad is bad and dad says mom is bad,
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.460]   and I must be bad too, right?
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.220]   Because in general, if your parents are bad,
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:12.560]   then the child takes that on themselves.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.060]   Now, again, I'm giving a simple example
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.640]   and I'm very much extrapolating it.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.760]   I mean, imagine if that were very, very aggressive
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.600]   where the mother, when this happens, right?
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.120]   Just tells the child how awful the father is
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.440]   and the father does the same.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.120]   Someone's not gonna come out the other side of that
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.140]   being like, you know what?
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.960]   Maybe they're both awful, but I'm not.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.660]   That's not how that goes, right?
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.420]   So the lessons, the traumatic lessons of childhood
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.180]   get internalized, right?
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:38.680]   And they don't even always have a solution state.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.160]   So you think about the man who knew like,
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.460]   okay, you have to go get this job
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.920]   and like all those things he internalized,
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.560]   you might say, well, I mean,
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.000]   he got to a good place for him, right?
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.180]   So for better or for worse,
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:52.160]   at least there was a place to go, right?
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.960]   To like to go work hard, go succeed, go check this box.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.820]   You've been told you're supposed to check.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.200]   But oftentimes there is no solution state.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.560]   So how many children, I mean, it's just terrible
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.920]   that this is such a high percentage
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.880]   of the work adult practitioners do
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.440]   is helping people who as children were told
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.260]   one way or another that they were worthless,
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.900]   incapable, bad, right?
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.620]   That gets put into the child, unfortunately, far, far,
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.340]   I mean, one time on the planet is too frequent,
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:22.700]   let alone how often this happens.
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:26.400]   - That example makes really good sense.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.540]   Could we, and this is a question,
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.860]   could we add to that the example
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:35.180]   whereby the child overhears examples of what,
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.700]   say, men should be like, or women should be like?
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:41.180]   Like these things, it's not so much like,
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.060]   you did wrong, Andrew, or you did wrong, Paul,
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.500]   or telling Dar, you screwed up.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.180]   But it's more, again, narratives that we overhear,
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:56.140]   or even a parent showing delight or excitement
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.260]   about a certain phenotype in the world.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:00.580]   Like, oh wow, look at that person, or look at them.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:02.940]   Like, isn't she beautiful, right?
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.160]   The young child thinks like, okay,
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.860]   well then that's the epitome of beauty
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.580]   through the lens of the parent.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.020]   Or gosh, like this person, like, ugh, you know?
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.980]   Like then that child internalizes
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.020]   that this is the epitome of disgust
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:16.540]   with another human being.
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:20.200]   And I think children are so savvy without realizing it.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.180]   It's like, okay, well then I guess you move toward that,
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:26.080]   and you aspire to that, and you deflect from that.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.740]   And you can see how these trajectories
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.600]   can be set very early on.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.220]   I mean, these are the four lane highways
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.780]   that we were talking about in episode one,
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.920]   where just routes of neural processing
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:40.300]   that can bring us to choices in life and places in life
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.360]   that oftentimes you're like,
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.540]   I don't want to go down this path anymore.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:47.620]   And so the exploration of early narratives,
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:49.100]   both direct and indirect, you know,
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.720]   first person and third person, seem so critical.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.380]   How does one go about that?
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:57.220]   I mean, clearly with a trained clinician like you,
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.020]   you would guide somebody through the process.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.020]   But if somebody were to try and do this
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:04.140]   in some sort of structured way for themselves,
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:06.020]   what do those lines of inquiry look like?
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.720]   Because we have vast number of experiences from childhood,
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.000]   but some messages are going to be more salient than others.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:12.840]   - Sure.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.700]   Yeah, the idea that reflective self scrutiny, you know,
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.880]   can help us, I think is just a great idea.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   It's a great concept.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.100]   And we do a lot of different things sort of inside,
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.280]   and we're guided to do a lot of things inside.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.260]   But this, I think, should overshadow many,
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.460]   if not most of all those other things of like,
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.980]   what's really going on inside of me?
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.840]   Because if you think about it,
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:35.160]   a lot of people will come through that,
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.540]   and they'll learn, right?
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.720]   So the person is told like, this is what beautiful is.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.480]   This is what successful is.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.660]   This is what good enough looks like, right?
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.300]   And that person may through all sorts of experiences,
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:47.900]   there may be other people in their lives
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:48.860]   who are more balanced,
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:50.980]   be able to arrive on the other side of that,
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:53.740]   even still sometimes going through the midst of it,
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.540]   depending upon age and situation.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.740]   And they're like, okay, like that's what, you know,
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.580]   my father and mother thinks like, this is what beauty is.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:01.500]   This is what success is.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.840]   But it's one set of opinions.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:05.780]   And it's not a set of opinions that are gonna define me.
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:07.840]   Like sometimes people get to that place,
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.620]   but a lot of times they don't,
[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.660]   and they carry that lesson forward,
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.660]   and they're not aware of it, right?
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:16.940]   So they think that they're very unattractive,
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.480]   even though other people are giving them different signals.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.420]   They think that they're very dumb,
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.460]   even though other people are giving them different signals,
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.740]   and their own grades and their own success
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.660]   may be giving them different signals, right?
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:30.100]   But they're not putting the two things together,
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:32.380]   and that's gonna generate tension, right?
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:34.560]   That might be why that person doesn't follow up
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.340]   on potential relationships, right?
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.480]   They just don't think they're good enough,
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.820]   and the person's eventually gonna reject them
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.220]   because of what they look like, right?
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:43.880]   They're taking that with them in this example
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.240]   from childhood, right?
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.020]   Or they're not satisfied with the job
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.680]   that in other ways is like really great, right?
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.000]   They enjoy the work, they enjoy everything,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.460]   but it doesn't pay enough, right?
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:54.300]   Why?
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.560]   Because they have some false idea inside
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.140]   of what it's supposed to pay, right?
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.620]   Because it's what the parent said.
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.380]   So by self scrutiny, like what are the givens?
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:04.580]   And I always think it goes back to the math minor, right?
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.660]   If you can't solve the problem,
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.700]   go back and look at the givens, right?
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.300]   What are you taking for granted?
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:12.260]   Like, oh, I know that every time I see an X,
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.500]   that X equals four, right?
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:16.700]   Really, maybe you wrote down four somehow
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.300]   because you were thinking of four at the time,
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.580]   and X actually is a three, right?
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.580]   So like just go back and look
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:25.020]   at what you're taking for granted, right?
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.620]   And a lot of times this is what we're doing
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:28.140]   in the therapy process,
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.620]   and then that's when the person can realize.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:32.260]   So I'm simplifying, but for the person to realize like,
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:35.100]   oh, there's a voice in my head, so to speak,
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:38.300]   it's a natural voice that is the voice of this person,
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.500]   right, who may not even be around anymore,
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.520]   whose opinion doesn't mean to me what it did before,
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.580]   but that voice is saying, you're unattractive.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:46.640]   You're not making enough money.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.700]   You're not good enough, right?
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.540]   And you know what?
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.540]   I don't believe that, right?
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.920]   They can identify that, and then you can,
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.220]   it doesn't happen all at once,
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.340]   but you can get it out of you.
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:57.420]   Generally, you don't get it out of you
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.220]   unless you realize that it's there.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:01.480]   What is the process of getting it out?
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:07.040]   Because I think that we all have the capacity
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.220]   to remember certain things and to arrive at a place
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:15.620]   where we can understand, okay, I'm taking for granted
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.340]   the fact that there's a voice in my head that says blank.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.500]   Actually, I have a brief anecdote to say about this,
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.740]   and this isn't the quote unquote, I have a friend thing.
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.300]   I literally have a female friend who the other day
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.740]   called me laughing and crying
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.060]   because she was being evicted from her apartment.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:35.000]   And she told her mother about this over the phone,
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.140]   and her mother's response was, well, at least you're thin.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:39.940]   - Wow.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.080]   - Like, and she was laughing and crying about it
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.940]   because it reflected so much of her childhood, right?
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.320]   That like no other accomplishment of having a job,
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.340]   having an apartment, et cetera, like, you know, mattered.
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:54.140]   It was about one thing.
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:56.780]   It was about a certain form of aesthetic beauty
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.300]   that I'm not even sure she subscribes to,
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.640]   even though she happens to be thin, right?
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.900]   So the fact that her mother would lift that
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.680]   from the conversation, there's such a deprivation
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.800]   of so many things in that interaction,
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.340]   but it really wasn't about that interaction.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.000]   It was, you know, she was calling me
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.700]   because it was really about her entire childhood, right?
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.180]   And obviously I'm not equipped to solve the problem
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:21.300]   and it wasn't a request for money or anything of that sort.
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.780]   It was just, it was almost like the hilarity
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.420]   and the sadness of the whole picture, right?
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.800]   But again, it speaks to these narratives
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.680]   that we internalize and that sometimes show up
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.380]   in very glaring ways in the real world.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.920]   It's like to hear that, I think, was shocking to her.
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.460]   I think she needed to tell me to like, is this real?
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.580]   But then it was clear that that message,
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:46.620]   it existed in her head for a long time anyway.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:49.300]   - That can be very pivotal if she realizes that, right?
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.340]   And even the power of the humor of it is like,
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:52.860]   this is absurd, right?
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.940]   That could be very powerful in creating change.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.780]   'Cause if there's some vestige of that inside of her, right?
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.540]   Where like, she still believes like,
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.500]   oh, I'm not good enough because I achieved A, B, and C,
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.380]   but I don't look like X or whatever.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:07.540]   It can have very much help 'cause there's a lot of power
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.420]   behind realizing that absurdity of like,
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.860]   oh my God, that's bizarre.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:13.300]   Like, so, but wait, is any of that inside of me?
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.220]   Am I carrying some of that with me?
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.460]   I mean, there's an incentive for self scrutiny
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:19.220]   and, you know, through what you're describing.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:23.020]   'Cause what's the ideal amount of that to still be in her?
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:23.860]   Zero.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.060]   - So as one comes to realize the messages they've heard
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.860]   or perhaps like in this case that they're still hearing,
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:34.420]   is the process of overcoming those messages
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.900]   and really arriving at the self,
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:39.400]   it sounds to me like it's a two-part process,
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.820]   at least two-part process.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:43.060]   It's to look in the bin of what are the givens?
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:46.420]   What am I taking for granted about the internal narratives?
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.680]   And thinking about their origins in childhood or elsewhere,
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.500]   but then also cultivating the self-awareness piece
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.700]   that's under the function of self.
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.820]   Like, wait, what's really true for me at the level of me
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.040]   that has, that isn't the,
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.060]   and this is really, I think,
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.540]   about separating out the voices in one's head,
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.020]   these internalized narratives,
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.700]   from the person that we really truly are.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.900]   - Because the idea is that those two pillars
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:12.420]   encompass everything we need to look at, right?
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.540]   Those 10 cupboards encompass everything.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.860]   So it's all that, right?
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:18.220]   The person who's going and looking at the givens,
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.180]   they're trying to understand
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:21.380]   what might be in my unconscious mind
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.180]   that I'm not aware of, right?
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:27.740]   And, huh, wow, the last time I got this big award at work,
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:29.220]   I had this reflexive thought of like,
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.860]   but you're not thin enough.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:32.880]   Wow, whoa, right?
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.940]   Like there could be a process,
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.580]   like that's going on inside of me.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.640]   I don't want that going on inside of me, right?
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:38.940]   So the process of trying,
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:42.460]   what is unconscious in us that may be causing us harm,
[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:44.980]   which is often where that's where the trauma goes, right?
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.620]   It's where the childhood trauma seats itself,
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.520]   which brings us back around to the intrusive thoughts, right?
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.520]   Intrusive negative thoughts and negative self dialogue
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:56.240]   usually does not mean what it meant
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.820]   to the man who need to change jobs, right?
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:01.060]   Because they were there for a good reason, right?
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:02.660]   Then he needed to make change.
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:06.980]   More often, they're the vestiges, the hangover,
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:10.940]   the lingering badness of some prior trauma.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:12.780]   So oftentimes when you think,
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.940]   we talked a little bit yesterday
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.060]   about the person who was driving in the car
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.480]   and just telling themselves over and over
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.160]   that they were, that they're a loser, right?
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.700]   And then they can't achieve the things that they achieved
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.140]   when they stopped doing that.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:26.400]   I'm simplifying a little, but that's the basics of it, right?
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.300]   Because the intrusive thoughts, the self-narrative,
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.900]   all the negativity in us is often coming
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.780]   from places that are in the unconscious mind, right?
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:38.800]   Not always, but this idea that I don't think
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.060]   I'm good enough, I'm saying it to myself
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:40.900]   over and over again.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:43.540]   Like, wow, let's go back and look at why,
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:45.060]   because the answer to that, again,
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.060]   lies in a different place.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:47.780]   It's just a different roadmap, right?
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:50.300]   The man who needed to change jobs had a roadmap
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:53.380]   that like spent a little bit of time in the eye,
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:54.760]   self-awareness, and then it kind of,
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.620]   then it went through self-defense mechanisms
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.340]   and action land, and it spent a lot of time with behavior,
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.660]   and then it got up to the strivings.
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:05.780]   That's his roadmap, whereas for someone who's laboring
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:08.220]   under the intrusive thoughts, the negative self-talk,
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:12.020]   the automaticity, the givens of childhood trauma
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:13.700]   then needs to go to a different place,
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.740]   where now we're spending time in the unconscious mind,
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:19.360]   thinking about what's there, figuring out what's there,
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.540]   bringing things to consciousness, right?
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:24.140]   That person, say, realizing maybe, you know,
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.440]   your friend, you had this realization of like,
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.900]   oh my goodness, we say, wow, did that bring something
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.660]   to the conscious mind in her?
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.740]   If so, great, let's look at that,
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:34.500]   and let's look a lot at it, and let's look,
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.580]   are there other things there too, right?
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:38.140]   Are there other givens, right?
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:40.560]   Let's bring them to consciousness
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:41.580]   so that we can talk about them.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:43.060]   We can identify them, and then look at,
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.300]   how does that relate to defense mechanism,
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.380]   the character structure?
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:48.300]   And like, now what are we doing?
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.380]   A process of interested inquiry.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.220]   Like, this is really interesting.
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:55.660]   I mean, it should be interesting to the person doing it.
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:56.940]   It's them, right?
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.420]   And it should be interesting to the person
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.020]   doing it with them, right?
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:02.180]   'Cause if you're a therapist and it's not interesting to you,
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.940]   you need another job, right?
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.580]   So you're talking to a friend,
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.220]   like if it's a friend is gonna be interested.
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:10.660]   So there's an interested, honest, open inquiry
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:14.000]   with the idea of, oh, let's learn things
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.340]   so that we can make change for the better.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.140]   And even though, as we talked about yesterday,
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:20.720]   the intrusive thoughts and the self-dialogue
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.980]   that's gone on over and over and over again,
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:24.860]   it doesn't go away easily.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.620]   But that doesn't mean it doesn't atrophy over time
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.420]   and go away, or that the person
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.900]   can have that reflexive thought like,
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:33.020]   oh, there's the thought again that I'm a loser,
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.020]   or that I should cut myself, or I should drink,
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:35.840]   or whatever it is.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.660]   And like, I know that thought appears in me automatically
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:41.460]   at times because it was in my head for so long,
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.660]   but it does not telling me anything, right?
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.740]   It's just an automatic thought.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:45.700]   It's telling me I should drink.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:46.920]   It's not telling me anything, right?
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.040]   Other than the fact that like,
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:49.960]   oh, that's what happens in human beings.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.520]   Like that's how the self-understanding brings change in us
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.980]   and gets us over the barriers
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.640]   of why I've been trying this for,
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.300]   you know, what modern mental health would often think.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:00.940]   I took the Selex and I did the 10 sessions of CBT.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.980]   Like, you know, I'm a failure.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.420]   Nothing will ever get better.
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:06.180]   You know, a different framing that says,
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.740]   hey, like this can get better over time in my understanding
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.460]   and my efforts and my thought redirection,
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.780]   my behavioral changes, all makes it better.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.660]   And then those things I don't want in my head,
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.980]   they're going away.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:18.640]   It's taking time, but they're going away.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:19.780]   - I'm relieved to hear you say
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:22.220]   that one can have intrusive thoughts
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:24.700]   and that one approach to dealing with those
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.260]   is to acknowledge them and look at them
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.940]   and not try and push them back deeper, you know,
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:33.420]   not trying to eradicate them.
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.660]   - I'm familiar with having intrusive thoughts,
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:40.420]   not all the time, but it varies periods throughout my life.
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:44.660]   And the idea that one can just like extinguish them
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.660]   is a great idea, but that's simply not the way it's worked,
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.740]   at least not for me.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.140]   But I have found that if I, you know, just say,
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:53.240]   okay, this is spontaneously coming up
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:55.520]   through the neural circuits of my subconscious
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.580]   and they're intrusive and I don't like them,
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:02.340]   but I eventually arrive at exactly the place
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.760]   that you described, which is that it's like,
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.620]   there's nothing actionable here.
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:10.920]   Like it's just, they go from being intrusive and troubling
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:14.760]   to intrusive and just kind of mildly irritating
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.360]   to intrusive and like, okay, you know, I just, you know,
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.580]   and yes, I go through some redirect,
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.900]   like trying to redirect my attention
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.660]   from time to time when they're happening,
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.020]   but I eventually just get to a place where it's like,
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:31.340]   okay, it's just a boring story or boring imagery.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:33.580]   There's nothing there, like there's nothing there.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:36.660]   And then they eventually break up like clouds.
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.860]   And that process could take a while, but-
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.880]   - Right, 'cause you took the energy out of them, right?
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.420]   You made them go away, which happened over time.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.100]   And then the energy that was so powerful with them
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.100]   was less and less and less.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.580]   And what happens, they dissipate, they atrophy, right?
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.260]   That's how they go away because there's no more power.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:53.180]   There's no more power in them.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.620]   And that really is the way that we make change.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:58.100]   And I think, you know, your emphasis upon
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:02.720]   the fact that it takes time, the fact that it takes effort,
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:05.500]   the fact that it only goes away slowly.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:09.220]   Over 20 years of, at times, being a therapist,
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.580]   what I've seen be the most daunting,
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.340]   the thing that makes people just give up and go away
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:16.040]   and go back to the things that are bad,
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.620]   give up on themselves, are that it takes time.
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:22.220]   And, you know, if you think it's supposed to take two weeks
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:23.840]   and the world around you is kind of leading you
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.740]   to think that, and then you go for help,
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:28.060]   and the help kind of leads you to think that,
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.500]   whether it's two weeks or it's 10 weeks,
[01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.960]   like if it's gonna take two years,
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.320]   you're gonna go away disheartened, right?
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.800]   Or maybe more angry at yourself or maybe demoralized.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:42.120]   So we have to look at the truth of all of this.
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:43.680]   Like a parallel to your story.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:46.560]   In my own life, for years and years and years,
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.320]   I carried a negative voice inside
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:51.360]   that was always waiting for me to do something wrong.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.480]   So if I say something that's a little bit off
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.980]   or not exactly what I wanna say now,
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.520]   it would say like, that wasn't good.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:59.300]   Like it says something negative inside to me.
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:00.760]   Or it's waiting for me to drop something
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.860]   and say that I'm stupid and clumsy, right?
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:04.680]   With me all the time.
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.240]   But over time, through self-reflection, through therapy,
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:09.120]   like through a lot of hard work,
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:10.720]   but a desire for things to be better
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:12.600]   and a desire to understand it, right?
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:14.120]   Like it's not there anymore.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.280]   I mean, every now and then it'll raise its head, right?
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.120]   I'll do something really.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.200]   I dropped a cup of coffee.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.160]   I haven't done it in 10 years and it made a mess.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.920]   And now people are coming to clean it up
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.840]   and man, the voice came back, right?
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.200]   But I could recognize it, right?
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.800]   Like I really feel bad about this.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.940]   And now it gives that voice a chance to come out,
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:32.540]   but it doesn't come out much anymore.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.120]   Whereas I lived with it for years.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.020]   It doesn't come out much anymore.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.700]   And when it came out not that long ago,
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:39.800]   like I could recognize it.
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:41.960]   Like I'm not happy I did this and let me help clean it up,
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.220]   but it doesn't mean I'm an idiot, right?
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:46.860]   So the voice in my head can just go away
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:51.120]   as I've been helping it to do for a bunch of years now.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.060]   - Yeah, I think also important for people to understand
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:54.060]   is that it takes time,
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:59.060]   but that we can all potentially engage in right actions,
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:02.420]   you know, moving towards strivings and hopefulness
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:05.060]   as we cope with those
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:07.540]   and try and diminish those internal narratives,
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:08.620]   those intrusive thoughts.
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:11.060]   It's not as if during the entire process,
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:12.500]   you know, you can't function.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.860]   I mean, I think that it's cognitively
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:17.820]   and sometimes even physically demanding to do,
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.580]   but we can still engage in healthy ways in the world
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:25.040]   and we can still try and avoid acting out
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.560]   and avoid forms of denial.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.940]   And as I say this, I'm realizing that, you know,
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.060]   the wish for or the impulse
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:35.840]   to really just suppress intrusive thought,
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.540]   born of trauma or whatever else is really futile.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:40.980]   Like that's not gonna work.
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:41.860]   It's not gonna work.
[01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.740]   We have to embrace these narratives
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:46.540]   and not expect them to disappear in a finger snap,
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:49.780]   but embrace them and like see them and look at them
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:52.780]   and be unafraid to look at them
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:56.740]   and discount where they are absolutely not true.
[01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:01.300]   - I would say unafraid to understand, right?
[02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:03.780]   Because we must understand.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:07.060]   It means we must look at what's going on inside of us.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:09.620]   When I didn't like that voice, but was afraid of it,
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.980]   like what is going on inside me?
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.300]   What does this say about me?
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.940]   And I'm directing away from it.
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:18.360]   Well, that's why it was with me for like several decades.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.200]   Right?
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.760]   But when I start to go look at it,
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.380]   I can find an answer to it.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:25.220]   And again, you have to look at what's going on
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:27.740]   in that person because one might presume,
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:30.140]   and maybe people listening are presuming this or maybe not,
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:32.640]   but a reasonable presumption
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.940]   that might just reflexively happen in a person
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.640]   would be to think that, oh, when I was younger,
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.040]   the messaging I was getting
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.920]   was that you're not good enough, right?
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:41.760]   You're not good enough, right?
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.000]   That's why I carry with me
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.160]   that you're not good enough, right?
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:46.740]   But it's not that.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:48.800]   Sometimes it's the opposite.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.500]   I was rewarded a lot when I was younger
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:54.260]   for doing things in a way everyone thought was great, right?
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:56.580]   Like getting great grades and being well-behaved,
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:57.580]   doing all sorts of things
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:01.060]   that brought a lot of positive reinforcement to me,
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.060]   but I never handled well things
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:05.420]   that fell even a little bit short of that,
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.820]   and then it would evoke a lot of shame.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:11.060]   So the oppression inside is not coming from denigration,
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:12.980]   it's coming from something different, right?
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:17.980]   Which is also why this is not a search to blame someone,
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:18.820]   right?
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:21.680]   Because sometimes the people who are giving the message,
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.220]   like they're doing the best they can.
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:25.300]   I mean, someone who's saying to a child,
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:28.480]   you're a loser, like that's not okay, right?
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.540]   No matter what, that's not okay.
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.800]   But that's often not how it happens.
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.040]   Like, you know, the parent, like he says, communicating,
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.320]   they don't realize that every time
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:39.020]   they're admiring a certain level of wealth
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:41.420]   or a certain kind of beauty, they're giving that message,
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:43.440]   that the child that doesn't meet that
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.760]   or ends up not meeting that isn't good enough.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.760]   But they don't know that.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:49.740]   Or, you know, like my parents tried to nurture me
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:51.380]   and they did a good job of it in many ways
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.680]   and teachers did a good job.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:55.780]   So they're realizing, hey, this person's gonna end up,
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:57.420]   you know, a bunch of years from now,
[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:59.680]   not thinking anything's good enough.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.720]   And I mean, they don't know that.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.120]   So it's not a search for blame.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.640]   And I think that's very, very important, very important,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.660]   because often people don't wanna look inside
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.680]   because they think either I'm gonna find
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.640]   something dramatically wrong with me.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.440]   And the answer I would give is there's almost surely
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.240]   not something dramatically wrong with you
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.800]   if you're having that thought.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.920]   And if somehow there is, you're better off
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.160]   looking at it now than later, right?
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.420]   And so that's part of it.
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:27.720]   The other part is that people become worried
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:29.920]   that they're going to ruin something.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.840]   You know, I'm gonna, I like my parents
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:35.800]   and if I go look at this, I'm gonna hate them.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.680]   Like people say things or think things like that.
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:41.920]   And the idea that we may get down to something
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:43.980]   that really involves someone being responsible
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.820]   for something bad.
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:47.680]   Now, if that's the truth, the person already knows
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.020]   that inside the vast majority of times.
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.680]   They know that, they're just not facing that.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.040]   But most of the time also, it's not that.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.760]   It's just like, okay, that's how life evolved
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.960]   and what's the predisposition?
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.380]   Like, you know, I was smart enough to get good grades
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:01.960]   and I have a low threshold for shame
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.520]   and people reinforced me.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:06.240]   And like, oh, like I can kind of understand that
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.640]   so then I can get control over it.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.280]   It's not a search for anger, frustration,
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.220]   blame of self or others.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.880]   - Yeah, and oftentimes I hear that people are afraid
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.000]   of dealing with these deeper issues
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.520]   or addressing these deeper issues
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:24.060]   for fear that they'll lose their drive, right?
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.640]   That the thing that makes them successful
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.660]   in the first place and that allows them
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:30.340]   perhaps even to afford therapy or afford the time
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:31.940]   to think about these sorts of questions.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:35.200]   So it seems to me that the drives
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.760]   that you referred to earlier, the generative drive,
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.280]   the aggressive drive and the pleasure drive
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:45.360]   are such critical nodes or areas to look
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:48.180]   for all of us in terms of figuring out
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:51.140]   whether or not we're doing well or less well
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.380]   according to some features
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:55.060]   that are pretty much universal in people.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:59.280]   Essentially what I'm saying is at least by my understanding,
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.900]   we all have drives to some extent or another
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:05.980]   and to the extent that our aggressive drive is very high
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:07.300]   and pleasure drive is very high
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:10.680]   and whether or not it's pointed in the right direction,
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.560]   it can be generative.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:14.940]   If it's not, perhaps it can undermine our generative drive.
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:17.940]   I'm very curious to know how you've observed
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.100]   the different ranges of these drives in people
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.740]   and how that predicts whether or not people will do
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.660]   more or less well in different areas of life,
[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:27.900]   essentially how the different drives play out.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:31.460]   - I think that the first thing to say is
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.940]   where the drives are at, so to speak, in any of us
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:37.060]   is a combination of nature and nurture.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:41.000]   So the nature part tells us the range
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.200]   sort of that the drive is gonna be,
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.440]   but because nurture means so much to humans,
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.480]   as we understand it from epigenetics,
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.680]   from the advancement of science,
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:53.960]   we see more and more and more how much nurture matters.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.880]   So the range that's denoted by nature
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:58.080]   is probably pretty broad.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.920]   I mean, we see the manifestation of that
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:04.040]   and then the nurture lets us then move that drive.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.760]   Now, sometimes nurture that's not gone in the right place
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.880]   and move the drive in the wrong direction, right?
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:12.280]   But as adults, as people who can take care of ourselves,
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:14.360]   who can learn about ourselves,
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:17.880]   we can change where the drives are seated.
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.740]   It's not an easy thing to do
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:22.120]   because it requires a lot of changes of self,
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.520]   of self-knowledge and hard work, but we can do it, right?
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.220]   We can change the sort of array of how those drives
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:32.120]   are manifesting themselves within us, and we see that.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.600]   I mean, that's part of the hopefulness
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.480]   of mental health treatment, right,
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.760]   that we see not just surface changes,
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:39.740]   but we can see changes on a deeper level.
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:43.080]   So I think it's important that these things are not fixed,
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.240]   although there are some natural elements.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:48.320]   Someone who may have a natural sort of low aggression
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.480]   or low self-assertion, okay,
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.320]   it's gonna be in the lower range,
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.000]   but it doesn't mean that it's locked in
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.200]   at any one particular point.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.200]   And that the place that we wanna be,
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.080]   what is the place that's consistent
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:00.680]   with the things that we want?
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:03.120]   The agency and gratitude as verbs
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.520]   and the sense of wellbeing and all of that.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:09.240]   So the idea is the state of health
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:12.980]   has the generative drive as prominent, right?
[02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:16.160]   It's the dominant drive, and then aggression and pleasure,
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:17.640]   which are still active in us,
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.480]   but they're subserving the generative drive,
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:22.460]   and that's the state that we wish to be in.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.180]   So when we're assessing, okay,
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.360]   why is there something that doesn't feel okay
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:28.580]   or something that's not going okay, right,
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:31.380]   then one way to start is to look at,
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:32.740]   okay, what's going on in the person?
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:34.320]   What may be off in the drives?
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.800]   That gives us a very strong idea of,
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:41.060]   okay, what's going on, a way of understanding
[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:44.840]   what's going on as we then go and look in the 10 cupboards
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.180]   to figure out the specifics.
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.940]   Okay, what is actually going on here
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:49.440]   that we can then change?
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.820]   But the framing of what's going on
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:54.400]   can come through the lens of looking at the drives
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.400]   and how they're manifest in us.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:59.760]   - What does it look like when the aggressive drive
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:04.400]   is very high and the pleasure drive is also very high?
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:07.620]   - So if these drives are running too high,
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:11.280]   where we end up at is in a place of envy, right?
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.840]   And envy, I'm always sort of on the soapbox about envy
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.960]   because I think envy is just so wildly destructive.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:21.220]   And if the aggressive drive is very high,
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:26.220]   so the person, say, in one way this can manifest itself,
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.440]   just wants more and more and more, right?
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.720]   They're not getting satisfaction from anything,
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:31.980]   but they want more.
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:35.600]   That may be because of a strong vulnerability inside of them.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:38.640]   So something that might map to narcissism, for example,
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:43.080]   there could be a strong aggressive drive to get more
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.680]   and that leads to something that's very unhealthy.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:48.100]   So the idea that I want more, I need more,
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:50.480]   I don't have enough, I can't get enough,
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:52.600]   then fosters envy, right?
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:57.600]   Which is not the desire to be better or to have more,
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:01.160]   but it's just the desire to feel better about the self,
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.120]   whether that involves raising the self up
[02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:05.060]   or bringing someone else down.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:07.180]   That's why envy is destructive.
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:10.860]   So very high levels of aggression that are not tempered,
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:15.080]   for example, by a generative drive that would also be high,
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.540]   then create a circumstance of envy
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:19.760]   and the envy is destructive.
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.440]   And the same happens if the pleasure drive
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.840]   is very, very strong.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.000]   So if one continues to want more pleasure,
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.480]   so I can't find any satisfaction,
[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:29.000]   I don't feel good about myself,
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.160]   I feel bereft inside, right?
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.480]   And I see that pleasure can make me feel better,
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:35.700]   but just for a little bit, right?
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:37.220]   Then it fades away and I want more of it
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:38.380]   and I want more of it.
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:40.960]   That also can lead to the place of envy.
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.600]   Like that's the outcome.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:45.700]   So if the aggressive drive is running very high
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.960]   or the pleasure drive is running very high,
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:49.320]   or if both are running very high,
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:53.620]   but it only takes one in order to end up in a place of envy.
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:56.940]   So if the generative drive is not high enough
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:59.560]   to overcome how high the aggressive drive is,
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.180]   which would mean then the aggressive drive
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:04.000]   would be sublimated towards good, productive things.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.140]   So take the energy and put it towards something
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:07.520]   that is goodness.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.500]   But if the aggressive drive was way out there
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:12.460]   ahead of the generative drive,
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:14.980]   that ends up in a place of envy,
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.420]   as does the pleasure drive.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.660]   If I want more and more and more,
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:21.940]   but I never get satisfaction from anything.
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:23.980]   It never brings me any sense of goodness
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:28.140]   that where it ends is in a place of vulnerability
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.300]   and resentment, right?
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:32.340]   'Cause envy involves wanting more, right?
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:36.200]   And envy, if we look at what's really going on,
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.640]   envy under the surface involves wanting everything, right?
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.580]   If a person is at the outer limits of envy, right?
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:44.660]   Which is why envy is so destructive.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:46.820]   Because if I can't get enough pleasure
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.260]   and there's so much aggression in me,
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:51.740]   then I'm not gonna make myself feel better.
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:55.500]   But what I can do is make other people feel worse.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.900]   - I wanna ask you more about envy,
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.580]   but first I want to ask,
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:02.440]   is one way to characterize the generative drive
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.900]   and to distinguish it from the other drives
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:09.680]   is to say that generative drives are pro-social,
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:11.820]   meaning they tend to bring about
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:14.840]   benevolent interactions between people?
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:19.580]   - In the sense that, so pro-social as constructive, right?
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:22.900]   As in a sense building goodness, then yes,
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.460]   because it's the drive in us
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:27.140]   that makes us wanna love and nurture things, right?
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:28.300]   That makes us wanna learn
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:30.660]   and sometimes learn to make better in the world
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:32.460]   or learn for learning's sake,
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:35.460]   that the drive is a drive of goodness.
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:38.500]   So if the drive is then gonna enact itself
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.460]   in the world around us, it's gonna be pro-social
[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:44.280]   because we exist as social units, right?
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.120]   I mean, if we decide,
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:46.740]   oh, I wanna be an island off somewhere,
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:47.940]   like that's not healthy, right?
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:50.900]   We exist in social units from small,
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:52.300]   like a nuclear family, right?
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.400]   To a neighborhood, right?
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:56.260]   All the way up to nations and to the planet.
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.420]   So if we perceive the truth of that,
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:02.260]   that, hey, there's an interdependence between me and others
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:06.220]   and I see that, then the drive will lead to
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.920]   choices and behaviors that are socially constructive.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:11.940]   - Earlier, you talked about aggression
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:15.300]   and you were clear to make sure that we all understood
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:19.060]   that aggression does not necessarily mean violent aggression,
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:21.260]   that there are different forms of aggression.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.980]   I'm curious if you could give us some examples
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:27.860]   of how you've observed people with high levels of aggression
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:31.060]   and high levels of pleasure drive as well,
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:33.080]   both male and female.
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:36.420]   And here, without defaulting to stereotypes,
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:38.500]   I think a lot of people just,
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.260]   despite the fact that you've clarified what aggression is
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:43.780]   and isn't in the context of this conversation,
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.260]   we hear the word aggression and we think
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.220]   verbal attack, physical attack.
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:50.120]   However, the way you're describing aggression
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.180]   and the aggressive drive,
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:54.060]   I have a feeling that you're referring to other expressions
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:55.180]   of aggression as well.
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:11:58.660]   - So if the aggressive drive is running too high
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:00.760]   and that could have factors of nature,
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:02.320]   factors of nurture, right?
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.340]   Factors of the situation the person is in,
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:05.580]   factors of their whole life,
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:09.780]   but it ends up at the moment in a place that is too high,
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:13.020]   then what that person is doing in one way or another
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:17.380]   is to try and exert an unhealthy level of control.
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:19.900]   And that can be done in so many different ways.
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:21.780]   It can be done in that overt way
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:24.020]   of just intimidating people, right?
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:26.140]   Of using harsh language for its people.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:27.960]   It can be done by manipulating people.
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.580]   It can be done through passive aggression.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:31.340]   There are all sorts of ways
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:34.300]   that the person can try and exert unhealthy control,
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:38.420]   but that's where we end up if there's too much expression
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:40.460]   of the aggressive drive in us.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.300]   - That makes sense.
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.700]   And it reminds me of an example from my own life where,
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:46.840]   well, first off, I should say I've had
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:50.180]   almost exclusively positive collaborations
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:52.440]   among my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere.
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:55.860]   Like every one of those collaborations has ended in a paper
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:58.120]   that we were all happy with, but more importantly,
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:02.040]   the relationships grew and were not diminished, right?
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.800]   But I had one collaboration with someone not to be named
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.700]   where it was going very well,
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:12.100]   but I had the need to reschedule an appointment.
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.340]   So I sent ahead a note about the fact
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.660]   that my car need dealing with, I had some other things.
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:19.720]   I explained why I need to reschedule the appointment
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:22.980]   and didn't receive a reply, which was a little unusual,
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:25.340]   but then eventually received a reply that said,
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.740]   well, it's clear that you don't want
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:30.300]   to pursue this collaboration,
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.700]   which is like the furthest thing from the truth, right?
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.140]   And so I expressed that
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:38.520]   and then the collaboration was reinstated.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:41.240]   But it brought to mind some concern for me
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:43.800]   because it was sort of an extreme reaction
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:47.800]   to something that happens among academics or anyone.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.240]   We get busy with things come up.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.780]   It was important to tend to the car that is.
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:54.260]   And then at some point later,
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:58.540]   they were late to a number of meetings.
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:13:59.780]   Okay, no big deal.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:01.460]   We're academics, we tend to run late.
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:03.460]   That's typical of many academics.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.420]   But then I was late once to a meeting
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.300]   and they essentially left and wrote an email
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:10.500]   that said something of the sort like,
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.120]   I've got my own great ideas.
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.760]   So I'm no longer interested in pursuing the collaboration.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.580]   And I was like pretty shocked, right?
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:21.440]   Because there was nothing really outside the ordinary
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:25.200]   in terms of busy-ness and professorial schedules.
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:26.720]   And there were other people involved,
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:28.360]   post-docs and things like that.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.980]   And there was a great project to be worked out.
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:33.460]   So I remember being disappointed,
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:35.400]   but also really kind of surprised.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.620]   But then when I mapped it back to the earlier example
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:40.020]   of the car incident, I thought,
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:43.960]   well, there's a real sort of lack of ability
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.980]   of this person to handle disappointment.
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:49.620]   And yet they're demonstrating some of the same behavior
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:52.920]   of occasionally running tardy and these kinds of things.
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.000]   And I remember feeling like it was pretty aggressive.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.180]   Like it's a pretty aggressive reaction to something
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.380]   that could have been handled with a conversation.
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:03.820]   Now, I must say, I'm very grateful
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:05.260]   that the collaboration didn't proceed
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:07.080]   and it went elsewhere and it worked out great.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.420]   And they're doing great and we're doing great.
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:10.020]   And so no hard feelings.
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:15.020]   But it stands out to me as a pretty salient example
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:17.580]   of aggression, but not played out
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:19.040]   at the level of yelling or anything.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.520]   There's a passivity in there,
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:24.060]   but then there's also kind of entitlement.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:24.900]   And here, of course,
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:26.420]   I'm only looking at the other person's behavior.
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:29.680]   And I should acknowledge, I realize, canceling, not good.
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:30.640]   Being late, not good.
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.780]   But listen, I'm a human being and I-
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:34.700]   - You canceled once, you were late.
[02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:38.460]   This isn't habitual, this is human stuff, right?
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:42.860]   - Right, and a lot of good work had gone into the project.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.560]   And there was a cost where most importantly,
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.120]   the postdoc suffered because they weren't involved
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.340]   in these interactions at all.
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.060]   And yet the project halted at that point.
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:56.440]   So to me, that seems like an example
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:01.300]   of somebody who has a, well, strong, aggressive drive.
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:04.360]   And that's clear from that they're incredibly successful
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:06.140]   in the academic domain.
[02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:12.480]   And when disappointed, lashes back or is passive,
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.320]   one or the other.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.140]   Is that kind of what we're getting at here?
[02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:17.320]   Not surprisingly, perhaps,
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:20.280]   the person rarely publishes with other people.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.720]   Probably that doesn't make a very good collaborative partner.
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:24.800]   - Right, and it totally makes sense.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:27.960]   I mean, if you think about what you're describing here,
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.660]   which is some vulnerability in the person,
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:32.400]   there's some way in which the person
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:34.440]   doesn't feel good enough, no matter what
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:36.120]   this person has achieved.
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.520]   So then there's a sense of the need
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:41.640]   and the right to over control.
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:43.680]   So when you agree to work together,
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:47.640]   you didn't agree that I'll never have to cancel anything.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.120]   Right, but the thought was different.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.800]   The framing is different on the other end
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:56.140]   that now we're gonna work together, right?
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:58.840]   So I'm exerting significant control over you, right?
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.760]   And again, you're not aware of it, right?
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:02.400]   And maybe that he's not aware of it.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:03.880]   - In this case, it was a she.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:04.840]   - Oh, okay, okay.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.520]   So I was thinking of someone different,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.320]   but she has to have some deficit of self
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:13.120]   that results in the reflexive need to over control.
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:17.160]   And think about the first response is a non-response, right?
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.000]   Which is, that's aggression.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.840]   It's just passive aggression, right?
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.520]   The thought would be, well, you're worried
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:23.560]   something doesn't feel good in you
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.560]   because I didn't respond, which was true, right?
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.760]   You're expecting a response.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.880]   Maybe you don't know, did you get the email?
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:29.720]   You know, what's happening?
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:30.600]   Is she mad?
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:31.800]   So it's sort of effective.
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:35.520]   It creates some consternation and some dissonance in you.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:37.520]   Then on top of that,
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.360]   the person is willing to potentially
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.000]   at that point sacrifice the relationship, right?
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000]   So you think about aggression now is not good, right?
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.800]   This excess aggression is not good for you.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:52.800]   It also is clearly eclipsing the generative drive, right?
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:55.420]   Because it's not good for this person and their research.
[02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:56.800]   It's not good for this person
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.320]   and the postdocs in their lab, right?
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.120]   But the person is willing to accept that
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.200]   in the service of gratifying the excess in aggression.
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.200]   Now, so then you said something
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.640]   that then sort of made it okay, right, for the short term.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.240]   Okay, then the person feels gratified.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:14.820]   Like whether you apologize or not, they took it as,
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:17.200]   you know, you've to some degree bowed down before me now,
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.520]   like it'll be okay, at least for the short term, right?
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:22.440]   But then the next thing that happens
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.300]   actually does end the collaboration, right?
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:28.480]   So that's not good, right?
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:31.120]   And you see, even from a self-serving perspective,
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.000]   that person was collaborating with you for a reason, right?
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.640]   She saw a benefit to the science
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:38.400]   that she's very, very interested in
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:40.800]   through the collaboration with you.
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:42.840]   But then let that all go, right?
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:44.180]   In the service of what?
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.320]   In the service of the ego, right?
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:50.040]   Of, you know, I don't feel good enough about myself, right?
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.440]   The response to that then is a response of envy,
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:55.220]   that I don't like that you have the freedom
[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:58.120]   to behave differently than I want you to, right?
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:58.960]   I don't like any of it.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.120]   I don't like that I don't control you
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:01.960]   as much as I would like to.
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:05.840]   And ultimately, it's that envy that becomes destructive.
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:08.260]   So it's a setback for that person.
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:10.640]   It's destructive of the science that person was doing.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.960]   It's destructive of the science that you were doing.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.360]   So envy is destructive.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.640]   And here, the high level of aggression,
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.900]   the aggressive drive is at a very high place.
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:24.040]   It's exceeding the generative drive.
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.640]   The pleasure drive isn't high enough either
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:26.560]   'cause there's not enough pleasure
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:29.600]   coming from the great science that's being done, right?
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.880]   So then the person is approaching the world
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.360]   through the lens of envy, right?
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.400]   They don't feel good enough.
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:40.160]   They wanna exert that aggression through overcontrol.
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:43.440]   And what they end up doing is destructive, right?
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:44.640]   And it's very clearly destructive.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:47.540]   It's a great example because it's destructive of the science
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:50.820]   which is ostensibly the reason that you're there, right?
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:52.080]   It's the reason you were there.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.240]   But someone who needs to exert overcontrol
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:56.920]   is there not just for that reason.
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:59.220]   And then the other reasons can trump
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:01.680]   the generative reason that they're there.
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:06.680]   And that's how envy, when it is the product of aggression
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:11.640]   or pleasure seeking being too high,
[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:16.380]   always, unfailingly creates destruction.
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:21.380]   And how different is that from agency and gratitude
[02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:24.480]   as active verbs, right?
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:26.200]   There's a sense of agency,
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:28.480]   but the agency isn't being exactly enacted
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:29.940]   'cause if the agency is being enacted
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:32.600]   in the service of science or career or whatever it may be,
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:35.380]   that's not going so well, right?
[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:37.840]   And the gratitude part isn't active.
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.200]   Like my goodness, I'm here.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.200]   Like I have this great career.
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:41.220]   I'm discovering things.
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:42.760]   I get to spend my life in science.
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:43.960]   I get to collaborate with you.
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:45.840]   Like there's so many things to feel good about.
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:47.600]   I have postdocs in my lab, right?
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:50.480]   I get to nurture them because I know more and I can guide.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:52.160]   But that's not leading, right?
[02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:55.000]   Envy is not those things,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.500]   which is why people who are doing that,
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:59.040]   at least in this realm of life,
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:00.560]   although this often, no,
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:03.380]   this bleeds into other realms of life.
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:05.800]   What you, the vast majority of times,
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.680]   you see as someone who does not have happiness, right?
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:10.920]   In the way that we're, you know,
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.040]   happiness with the quotes, right?
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:15.920]   That happiness is, you know, the sense of peace, right?
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:18.720]   The sense of wellbeing, right?
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:21.680]   This being able to delight in things, contentment, right?
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:23.700]   The person doesn't have that, right?
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:24.920]   And here it's interesting, right?
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:28.000]   This person gets to the highest levels of academia
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.080]   and they're very successful
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.960]   and they have a lab of their own and they're collaborating.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:34.380]   You think that's all great, right?
[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:35.480]   But not inside of them.
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.640]   It's not bringing them those things
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:40.120]   as evidenced by how this person is behaving.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:42.360]   And I would bet almost 100% if you say,
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:45.120]   what's that person like in other aspects of life,
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:47.740]   at least in the professional world, probably in others too,
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:49.680]   no one's gonna describe a happy person.
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:52.160]   So much of what you just said
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.200]   captures this individual extremely well.
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:58.920]   And it also reminds me that so much of the way
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:01.480]   that you're describing this aggressive drive
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:04.080]   can also be observed perhaps in the way
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.720]   that people show up to social interactions,
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:08.740]   not necessarily big interactions,
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:10.640]   maybe even just interactions between two people.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:14.200]   What I'm thinking of here is the person, male or female,
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:17.640]   who shows up and just kind of takes over,
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:20.440]   like talks the whole time and tells stories.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:23.640]   I went to a meal when I graduated university
[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:27.040]   and someone showed up for the first time at this meal,
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:28.400]   meaning we had never met them before,
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:30.720]   and just like sat down and just started telling stories
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:32.200]   for like an hour.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:35.440]   And it was interesting, portions of it were captivating.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.240]   And then at some point I realized
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.760]   this is either total pathology,
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:42.320]   like this person is crazy, but they weren't crazy,
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:45.720]   or they have no recognition
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:48.840]   that they're absorbing all the oxygen in the room
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.280]   as it's sometimes described.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:53.880]   But it seemed like they had this need
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.040]   to just control the whole environment by way of speech,
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:00.360]   just like, you know, fire hose stories.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:03.800]   And I've seen this definitely in the academic realm.
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:06.280]   I've seen this in the non-academic realm
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:07.120]   and social settings.
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:11.640]   And what's interesting is perhaps why this person does this
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:12.640]   or these people do this.
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:15.620]   But what's also interesting is how people react to it.
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:19.220]   On the one hand, I think most people find
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.060]   that kind of obnoxious,
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.120]   but there also seem to be people who see this as like,
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.840]   oh, that person has a lot of agency.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.000]   Like they're a leader.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.180]   Like they actually grab a lot of the attention
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:31.020]   that they're seeking.
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:34.440]   And we tend to view those people as kind of empowered.
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.840]   I don't actually think that they're necessarily empowered,
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:39.800]   but perhaps this stems from the feeling
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:42.020]   that the rest of us, I like to think have,
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:44.520]   which is some sense of social etiquette
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:45.840]   where there's some give and take.
[02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:47.040]   You know, you walk into a room,
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:50.360]   you kind of assess, you know, what's the context here.
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:53.840]   There's some listening as well as some speaking and so on.
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:55.320]   And so when someone shows up
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.440]   and kind of violates all those rules,
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:59.080]   on the one hand, it can be obnoxious
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.200]   and overtake everything.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.540]   But as I said before, you know,
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.120]   there's also this sense of like,
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:07.280]   oh, like that must be nice to just be able to like
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:09.480]   be as one feels.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:12.640]   And so I think I'm describing this
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.340]   not because I think people should mimic
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:17.000]   this type of behavior either way, you know,
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.340]   be really meek and not say anything that's on their mind
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:20.300]   or just overtake.
[02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:23.500]   But because I feel like it might be an exploration
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:25.840]   of this aggressive drive.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.020]   And if someone's doing that,
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:30.020]   are they trying to like mask something else?
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:34.380]   And why do people react to these seemingly powerful people
[02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:35.220]   in this way?
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:37.040]   - These things happen in the world around us, right?
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.140]   They're independent of the spectrum of gender,
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:41.920]   the spectrum of intelligence achievement, right?
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.400]   They're human problems.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.800]   So a person you're describing,
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:50.400]   whether that person has character structure problems
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:53.200]   that are present with them across time,
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.620]   or whether they're in a certain place, you know,
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.220]   whether it's in life or today,
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:24:59.760]   like we don't know for sure what the underpinnings,
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:02.360]   but what you're describing is
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:05.480]   it's a presentation of narcissism, right?
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.480]   And narcissism is rooted not in confidence,
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:11.100]   not in arrogance, right?
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:13.080]   It's rooted in vulnerability.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.440]   It's rooted in I don't feel good enough.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.000]   And narcissism then engages with the world
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.560]   through the lens of envy.
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:25.320]   So no one else gets to have any time.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.560]   No one else gets to say anything funny.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:30.420]   No one else maybe gets to say anything at all, right?
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:34.040]   There's a dominance of the room, right?
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:35.960]   There's a dominance of the room
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:39.360]   that comes through an inability to tolerate
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:43.080]   the back and forth of human interactions, right?
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:44.640]   Human engagement, right?
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.540]   So then that person becomes very dominant.
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:48.420]   And why is that?
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:50.760]   Because when they tell a story and they get a laugh,
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:52.820]   or even if it's not that funny and it's a 15th story,
[02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:55.600]   but somebody smiles a little bit or nobody smiles,
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.580]   they can perceive inside that like, I just did that.
[02:25:58.580 --> 02:25:59.420]   I said that.
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:00.780]   And maybe somebody responded positively.
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:01.860]   I feel good about that.
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:03.940]   For a split second now that's gone.
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:07.540]   And then the next thing comes and the next thing comes
[02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:09.780]   because people who are coming at the world
[02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:11.620]   through the lens of narcissism,
[02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:15.400]   whether it's just in that particular event, right?
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.380]   Or it's across life, right?
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:19.260]   Are never satisfied.
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.660]   And nothing ever brings enough goodness.
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:25.820]   Nothing ever brings enough feeling of pleasure.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:27.580]   So the person then wants more.
[02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:29.820]   And that's how the person dominates the room.
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:32.320]   Now that can be very seductive, right?
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.460]   Narcissistic people, not always,
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:36.540]   but are often very seductive
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:39.140]   because of that appearance of mastery, right?
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:40.180]   Of control.
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:42.040]   So that person did have,
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:44.380]   we could look at it in the short term and say,
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:47.060]   that person had mastery over the room, right?
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.380]   No one said anything for an hour, but them, right?
[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:50.700]   So they had mastery over the room.
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.380]   They had control over the room.
[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:55.260]   But what they're doing is exerting over control, right?
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:56.420]   In the short, it's like, you know,
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:58.660]   penny wise and pound foolish, right?
[02:26:58.660 --> 02:27:01.540]   Borrow a dollar today to pay back a hundred tomorrow, right?
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:03.620]   Because they got to control that room.
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:06.420]   But a lot of people, not everyone, right?
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:08.220]   Some people are seduced by it, right?
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:10.140]   But a lot of people will take away from that
[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:11.640]   something that's not a good feeling,
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:13.120]   something that wasn't mutual,
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:15.260]   that doesn't make a person want to collaborate
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:16.100]   with that person,
[02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:18.460]   even be in the same space as that person, right?
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:20.940]   So it's counterproductive, right?
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:23.260]   Because the people who might come under the spell,
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:24.440]   so to speak, right?
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.620]   They're the people who were brought under the spell, right?
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:30.140]   They're less observant, dynamic,
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.540]   you know, intuitive, introspective.
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:34.540]   They're not the people that you want,
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.040]   in a sense, on your side, right?
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:38.940]   The people that would be most valuable to collaborate with,
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:41.180]   even as thought partners, have conversations with,
[02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:43.060]   like those people are going to be put off
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:46.040]   because even if they don't know exactly what's wrong,
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.780]   they know like, that didn't feel good.
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:49.940]   And they map, do I want that feeling more in my life?
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.360]   No, right?
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:53.860]   So that's the counterproductive aspects.
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:56.060]   Well, that's why narcissism is destructive.
[02:27:56.060 --> 02:27:57.780]   'Cause you might say, well, there's nothing destructive
[02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:00.900]   in that, you know, in that interaction.
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:03.820]   But again, you have to be standing so up close to it
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:05.540]   that you don't see the bigger picture.
[02:28:05.540 --> 02:28:06.940]   'Cause when you stand back from that,
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:09.440]   that's not a person who's, by and large, you know,
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:11.160]   you see that's not a person who's interconnected
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.380]   in the world around them,
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:14.160]   has a group of good, supportive friends,
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.640]   has a bunch of colleagues
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.360]   where they can sort of exchange information.
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.420]   And, you know, 'cause all that social dynamic
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:21.240]   has to happen in the rest of life.
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:25.520]   So you're seeing a situation that is counterproductive,
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:28.080]   that is destructive, and you always see that
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:30.200]   when people are enacting narcissism,
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:32.700]   whether it's, okay, a bunch of bad things have happened,
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:34.920]   and for whatever reason, like I'm in an unhealthy place
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:36.220]   and I'm enacting it right now,
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:38.100]   or if I'm enacting it every day of my life
[02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:39.440]   because it's in my character structure
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.920]   and I have it recognize and change it,
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.940]   it's always destructive.
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:46.680]   - The narcissists that I've known and observed
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:49.080]   almost always seem to have a partner
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:52.560]   who clearly supports their narcissism,
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.800]   or at least doesn't speak up very much against it,
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:58.240]   at least not publicly, and not much else,
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:59.900]   except a professional role.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.980]   In fact, there's one scientist who I did not work with
[02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:05.240]   who comes to mind, and the joke about him
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:08.920]   was always that this person would talk about themselves
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:11.800]   endlessly for the first half hour that you run into them
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:13.520]   and say, okay, well, enough about me.
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:15.120]   Why don't you tell me about me?
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.720]   This person moved to a different country with their partner,
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:22.400]   comes back every once in a while,
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.640]   has essentially done nothing over the last decade or so,
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:27.780]   kind of left the field.
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:31.820]   And it's kind of secretly the laughing stock of the field.
[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:34.280]   There was one other anecdote about this person.
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:36.040]   I'm just, I'm not picking on them.
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.800]   I'm just trying to explore these dimensions of aggression
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.040]   and low pleasure drive and envy.
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.040]   At lab meetings, it was well-known
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:49.080]   that they would host a basketball game,
[02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:54.680]   but it was well-known that you did not want to score
[02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:56.640]   like, you know, on this person
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:00.320]   because you would be asked to leave the lab.
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:03.600]   And indeed several people were asked to leave the laboratory
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:06.260]   for having embarrassed the lab head
[02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:07.920]   at one of these lab events.
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.340]   - By participating in exactly the event that was described
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:14.340]   in the way it was described and doing something competent.
[02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:16.960]   - Right, so the game was essentially a way
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.380]   for the person to build themselves up.
[02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:21.920]   And they were a mediocre at best basketball player.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:24.080]   So like, here's this game where everyone's expected
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:26.240]   to pretend, right?
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:28.240]   And I have to imagine, pretend that the person
[02:30:28.240 --> 02:30:30.660]   is actually better at what they do than they are.
[02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:34.720]   And in some ways, it feels like a replica
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:38.040]   of how narcissism shows up in so many other areas of life.
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:40.160]   Like you said, you know, these people are rarely surrounded
[02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:44.720]   by people who are actually very bright,
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:48.760]   self, you know, self-effacing, et cetera, you know,
[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:51.960]   who they tend to gather people that just support them
[02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:54.960]   or no one at all because no reasonably healthy person
[02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:56.720]   would choose to be around that.
[02:30:56.720 --> 02:31:01.720]   - Right, because that game is a metaphor for all of life
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:02.760]   for that person.
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:05.280]   It's sending that message, like see this message
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:07.840]   and extrapolate it out to everything else, right?
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:09.680]   And what is so, what's the metaphor?
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:10.640]   What's it communicating?
[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:15.640]   It's communicating that you don't do anything better
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:17.640]   than I do, right?
[02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:20.300]   You don't rise above me, interestingly, right?
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:22.480]   You don't rise above me in any way.
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:24.320]   You don't get to know things I don't know.
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:28.780]   You don't get to do anything better than I do, right?
[02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:32.440]   Or I will be destructive towards you, right?
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:35.060]   It's fascinating because it's not about the game, right?
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:40.060]   The game is a way of communicating that message, right?
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:42.600]   Interesting, the person not even that good at the game,
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.840]   like why not choose something you're really good at, right?
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:47.280]   'Cause then the message is not communicated as clearly,
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:49.280]   right, and a lot of this is coming as unconscious.
[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:51.640]   Let's choose something I'm kind of fair to middling at,
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:53.080]   right, and then make it very clear
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:54.740]   that no one gets to be better,
[02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:57.340]   or I do something destructive to them.
[02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.200]   I mean, that's exactly what that is.
[02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:02.040]   And imagine like someone is thrown out of the lab, right?
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:04.440]   I mean, like this is in many ways,
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:05.920]   like the biggest thing in their life
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.760]   or one of the biggest things in that person's life.
[02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:08.240]   - Yeah, it's anti-generative.
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:11.100]   I mean, the cost of that in the larger world
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:14.440]   is one less potentially fantastic scientist.
[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:15.520]   - Right, and that's the broader,
[02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:16.880]   that's always the broader picture
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:20.080]   because the narcissist is standing very, very close
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:21.600]   to the tapestry, right?
[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:24.480]   And so the interaction there is
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:28.280]   you have scored a basket when I have not, right?
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.120]   So you don't understand the message
[02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:32.280]   that you're not supposed to exceed me.
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:33.780]   And now I will get rid of you
[02:32:33.780 --> 02:32:35.480]   because you're dangerous to have around, right?
[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:36.680]   Because you don't get the message
[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:39.160]   and you may exceed me in other ways.
[02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:41.200]   And also I'm gonna feel better
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.620]   because I have the power to be punitive, right?
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:45.960]   Even though it's wantonly punitive, right?
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:49.040]   And completely unjustified, but I have the power to do that.
[02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:51.840]   And it'll make me feel good then to push you away.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:53.200]   And I know that's not gonna be good for you
[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:55.080]   and I'll feel good about that, right?
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:57.200]   But that doesn't last.
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:59.520]   Of course, that's why the person continues to do it.
[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:02.960]   And it also doesn't understand at all
[02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:06.360]   that like that's not good for science, right?
[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:10.500]   Or most importantly, that's not good for me, right?
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:12.200]   There's a graduate student in that lab
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.520]   'cause you didn't say fire the graduate,
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:17.560]   make the graduate student leave if the person wasn't good.
[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:18.940]   No, it's make the graduate student leave.
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.040]   No matter what.
[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.440]   So the person is doing things
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:24.040]   that are injurious to the society around us,
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:26.600]   obviously to the specific person they're targeting
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.400]   and also to themselves.
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:31.900]   And that's where if you follow envy
[02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:34.320]   and you see high levels of it
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:36.440]   in situations that are unbounded.
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.320]   So like this situation is unbounded
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.800]   in the sense that the person can do that.
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:41.120]   There's no higher authority.
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:43.920]   - Right, well labs, this is changing.
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:46.800]   And by the way, I should back up a second and say that
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:48.580]   I do believe and it's been my experience
[02:33:48.580 --> 02:33:50.160]   that most scientists and lab heads
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:53.680]   are not narcissists, are quite kind, are benevolent.
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:54.660]   I mean, they can be a little quirky.
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:58.000]   We're scientists after all, but not narcissists.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.380]   At the same time, it is true that for a long time,
[02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:05.880]   less so now, laboratories were sort of like little fiefdoms.
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:08.400]   There was very little oversight from the universities.
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:09.860]   And so the lab you joined
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:12.760]   became your entire world and landscape.
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:14.300]   And there was some exploitation
[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:17.000]   by narcissistic lab heads for sure.
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.480]   - Yeah, as you said, it was unbounded, right?
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:21.560]   Like there was no oversight.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:25.560]   Whereas this would be much harder to recreate today
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.940]   if someone wanted to.
[02:34:26.940 --> 02:34:29.680]   - And I think that's why by almost everyone
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:32.160]   listening to this, it will resonate with them.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:35.060]   They'll find some familiarity because you see this
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:37.220]   or you can see this in situations
[02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:39.820]   where there's a bounded group of people, right?
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.320]   There's just a certain group of people
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:43.820]   in a certain situation and that's who they are.
[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:47.000]   But the authority of the person leading the group
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.080]   is unbounded.
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:50.800]   So there's a situation where if that person
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:53.980]   has narcissistic tendencies, aggressive drive is too high,
[02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:56.140]   pleasure drive is high but not being met,
[02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:58.020]   if all of those things are happening,
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:00.460]   that's when you see this come to light,
[02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:03.480]   which is why the destruction varies
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:07.440]   based upon the destruction that's permissible
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:09.320]   within the framework, right?
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.260]   So here, this person wasn't gonna like
[02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:13.640]   fire everyone in their lab, right?
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:16.640]   So in a sense, they could only damage their labs so much,
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:18.640]   although maybe if you damage your labs so much,
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:21.640]   you don't get funding, you inadvertently sink yourself.
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:24.280]   So even there, that person could bring about
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:25.660]   their own destruction.
[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:29.540]   But when you see the other end where it's truly unbounded,
[02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:31.600]   like in the sense of war, right?
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.500]   As someone who can control a machine of war,
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:37.600]   who then has everything, right?
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.540]   Like what do they need, right?
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:41.360]   Well, they need something they don't have
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:42.240]   and never will get.
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:46.320]   So now they start enacting more and more is destructive,
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:47.160]   right?
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:48.240]   And you think, "Oh, that person wants something."
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:51.600]   I mean, how many times does someone start a war, right?
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.800]   There's clearly an unjustified war, right?
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:56.120]   It's a war because they want something.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:58.840]   Then they get something and they're satisfied, right?
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.560]   That's not how it goes, right?
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:02.480]   Then they get something and they're not satisfied
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:03.480]   and they want more.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.200]   So in discussions at times about narcissism and envy
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:10.660]   and how that can play out on the world stage.
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.000]   So sometimes huge events in human history will come up
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.880]   and people, for example, will bring up Adolf Hitler
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:21.560]   and the idea that Hitler wanted things, wanted things.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:26.400]   No, the unbound narcissism, the unbound envy
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.060]   wanted destruction, right?
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:32.400]   This is a person who, if things had continued to go
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:34.660]   as this person intended, right?
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:37.800]   There would have been no one left on earth but him
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.520]   because the process is nothing but destructive,
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.640]   which is why after the fact there's incalculable
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:47.360]   human carnage, right?
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:51.300]   And he himself was among the incalculable human carnage
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:56.080]   because that's the end point of narcissism.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:58.600]   That's the end, of narcissism on a broad stage, right?
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.020]   That's the end point of envy at its highest magnitude.
[02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:04.200]   And we see that as examples, whether we see
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.240]   on the smaller stage of the lab, right?
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.840]   A head that you're describing or on the larger stage
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:14.580]   of unbounded war, we end up with destruction like 100% time.
[02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:18.060]   That's the final common pathway for all of that.
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:20.720]   - Are there some consistent themes of childhood
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.840]   that lead somebody to become a narcissist?
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.080]   And in addition to that, I'm curious whether or not
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:30.920]   narcissists ever have insight, whether or not
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:34.240]   if offered the opportunity to explore the 10 cupboards
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:36.960]   under the structure of self and function of self,
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:40.720]   whether or not they eventually see inside those cupboards
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:44.040]   and go, oh my goodness, I've got this self
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:45.880]   that's clearly overinflated and I've got
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:48.400]   these defense mechanisms and I'm so envious
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:50.520]   in the end and modify their behavior,
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:52.720]   or whether or not the narcissists are immune
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.780]   from a constructive self-reflection.
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:56.620]   - Right, right.
[02:37:56.620 --> 02:38:01.620]   To answer the first part is the vast majority of narcissism,
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:03.960]   it may be all of it, we don't know for sure,
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.340]   is rooted in the childhood trauma
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:08.440]   of not feeling good enough, right?
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:13.080]   Which is not an excuse for people doing awful things.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:14.120]   It's not what we're saying.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.520]   We're trying to have an explanatory mechanism, right?
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:20.060]   Which goes back to formative life experiences
[02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:22.160]   and not feeling good enough, whether it was
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:24.600]   because that person was directly denigrated
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:26.600]   or that person wasn't denigrated
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:29.780]   but could never work hard enough, never could be enough
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:32.760]   to get approval, right?
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:35.980]   Again, it's not 100% and human beings are complicated,
[02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:38.240]   but if you go and look, you see that,
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:39.620]   that there was never a state of like,
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:41.640]   oh, I feel good enough about myself, right?
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.720]   And if there's never a state of I feel good enough
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.640]   about myself because someone has told me that
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:46.860]   and given me the pat on the head
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:48.500]   or given me the positive comment,
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:51.240]   you can see how in a certain sort of natural lay
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:53.280]   of the land genetically and in concert
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.020]   with other experiences, that person can get to adulthood
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:38:59.720]   with a lot of aggression in them
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:01.940]   and never having experienced I'm good enough,
[02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:04.080]   it's still running along inside of them,
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:06.260]   and then they're enacting that aggression
[02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:07.180]   in the world around them.
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:10.120]   That's most commonly what we see
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:14.560]   and because there's such deep vulnerability
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:17.720]   and such deep insecurity, then people,
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:20.200]   let's say people who suffer from full-blown narcissism,
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:22.100]   narcissistic personality disorder,
[02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:25.880]   so inaction of envy on the highest levels,
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:29.380]   that is, they're so defended,
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:33.160]   they're so strongly defended in an unhealthy manner
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:35.440]   from seeing their own vulnerability
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.160]   that it is extremely difficult to get that person
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:43.640]   to come around and say, okay, let's look in those 10 cupboards.
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:45.760]   Within the field, people often talk
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.600]   about treating narcissistic people,
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:51.780]   they talk about it in a nihilistic way,
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:53.760]   and some just be very experienced.
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:55.720]   People say, oh, that's impossible, right?
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:56.600]   That never gets better.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.960]   Now, I'm not a believer in therapeutic nihilism.
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:04.440]   I think that, yes, it is the norm
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.560]   that that person just can't get it together
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.000]   to go look at that thing.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.160]   They're so defended against it, they're so afraid of it.
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:13.480]   They won't look anywhere near it,
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.840]   so they're looking in the other direction
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:16.920]   and they're furthering all that on health.
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:19.880]   It's not the case that it's always that way.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:22.840]   And on a couple of occasions, I have worked with,
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.500]   seen, witnessed narcissistic people who can make changes.
[02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:30.360]   Now, it's usually in the context of something very extreme
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.080]   that causes them to do that.
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:34.060]   So, someone who will no longer have access
[02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:37.200]   to family members they want to see
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.360]   or to financial resources
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:42.300]   that they need to keep themselves afloat.
[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:44.260]   It's things that often are that dramatic.
[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:46.880]   It's not always that, but we can see, though,
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:49.720]   in those kind of extenuating situations
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:54.160]   where the problem is so big, the envy is so high,
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.760]   but the motivation for change is very, very high
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:58.580]   because in the carrot and stick model,
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:00.700]   the stick here is very, very strong,
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:02.720]   that if a person then goes and does that,
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:05.520]   you can see change inside of them.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:09.700]   So, we're never in a place of therapeutic nihilism,
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:13.200]   but the barriers to that are very, very high
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.120]   because the self is so wounded
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:19.500]   that the person is protecting that self so strongly.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:22.640]   That's why the narcissism and envy are so full-blown,
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:25.280]   and it's hard to get that person to go back and look,
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:26.620]   but not impossible.
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:28.220]   - Based on what you're telling me,
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:32.100]   it seems that it's a very low probability
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:37.100]   that a non-clinician could change a narcissist.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:40.800]   In other words, if one is engaging in the world
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:44.620]   with a narcissist because they have to, presumably,
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:47.520]   or they just find themselves in that place,
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:49.180]   would you say to that person,
[02:41:49.180 --> 02:41:50.600]   there's very little, if anything,
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.880]   that you can do to change the narcissist's behavior
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:56.180]   or psychological framework?
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:58.320]   If they can, because, of course,
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:01.080]   if the narcissists can't often do it for themselves
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.880]   with the help of a skilled clinician,
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.480]   why would anyone else be able to achieve that?
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:08.960]   - So, we're coming at what we're doing here
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:12.380]   from a perspective of truth about human beings, right?
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:15.680]   And that truth brings with it hopefulness, right?
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:18.120]   It brings with it hopefulness that people can change
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:19.320]   and how people can change.
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:23.540]   And I am 100% all for that.
[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:25.920]   It's the way to look at ourselves, right?
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:30.700]   But it is also true that there are aspects of pathology
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:35.220]   that require clinical treatment in order to improve.
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:37.640]   So, now we're looking from the other side and saying,
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.160]   hey, there's a problem here and there's a deep problem here.
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:43.600]   And that, we have to come at from a different perspective
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:45.620]   of how can you help that problem?
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:47.200]   And there's a science behind this, too,
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.900]   of what level of clinical care, for example,
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:53.000]   is most likely to be helpful to someone like this.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.680]   And it's not an individual clinician even, right?
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:59.240]   It's a team of people who work through different modalities
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:01.400]   who can sort of wrap around that person.
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:05.120]   So, it's not just a level of clinical care is needed,
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:07.720]   but it's a relatively high level of clinical care.
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:10.140]   And that, in general, is the only way
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:11.360]   that we get at narcissism.
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:15.080]   That's not 100%, but that's the vast majority of time.
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:17.080]   So, what can then the person do, right?
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:19.880]   A person cannot be a team of clinicians, right?
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:23.320]   What that person can do, one choice is to disengage, right?
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:27.800]   But disengagement can come with the promise of re-engagement,
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:30.580]   right, many, many times I've worked with people
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:32.720]   and practiced and rehearsed with them,
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:36.560]   like, okay, what might you say to someone along the lines of,
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.240]   you know, I've known you for a long time
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:40.160]   or I care about you or I love you, right?
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:41.680]   Whatever they may say to lead in,
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:45.440]   but I can't be with you or I can't be around you, right?
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:48.920]   There's something going on that makes it not okay for me.
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:50.320]   It doesn't feel okay.
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.560]   You know, a person maybe says things like,
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.000]   you know, you're aggressive or demeaning or whatever it is,
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.720]   or maybe they just say, it just doesn't feel okay,
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:56.820]   I can't have it.
[02:43:56.820 --> 02:44:00.600]   And then the need to step away from the person,
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:03.600]   but look, if you got some help, right?
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:05.320]   If you took better care of yourself in ways
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:09.360]   that would be better for you and for the people around you,
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:10.920]   then of course I'd wanna be in your life.
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:12.120]   You know, something like that.
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.680]   So, disengagement can come, you know,
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:19.100]   with that encouragement, right, to the person.
[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:22.120]   But one way or another, you have to set boundaries,
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:23.700]   which is, okay, I have to deal with this person,
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:25.720]   so I'll deal with them a little bit.
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:28.640]   Or I don't have to deal with this person, so I won't, right?
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.060]   Or I can't get away from this person,
[02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:32.340]   so I have to take with a grain of salt
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:33.640]   what they're saying to me.
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:37.180]   But ultimately, some form of strong boundaries
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:40.580]   or disengagement is, like, that's the response,
[02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:43.660]   that's the self-care response, right,
[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:46.840]   for the person who's with the narcissist.
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:48.960]   - What are some other ways that the aggressive drive
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:51.800]   and pleasure drive and generative drive,
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:53.220]   for that matter, play out?
[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:56.000]   For instance, we talked about the former patient of yours
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.980]   who eventually switched jobs,
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:00.840]   clearly had a generative drive within him,
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:03.100]   but it was being blocked by a number of choices
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:07.460]   rooted in narratives that originated in childhood, et cetera.
[02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:10.200]   We talked about individuals with high aggressive drive,
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:11.940]   high degree of pleasure drive,
[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:14.800]   but a very diminished capacity to experience pleasure
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:16.380]   and therefore a lot of envy
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:18.260]   and the destruction that comes with envy.
[02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:19.220]   - Yes.
[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:22.260]   - What are some of the other variations on these drives
[02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:25.380]   as you observe them in your clinical practice?
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:27.260]   - Well, our overall framing is
[02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:29.440]   we want the generative drive
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:31.620]   to be the one that's deterministic, right?
[02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:34.300]   It's the one with the strongest influence.
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:37.380]   So we want to nurture the generative drive in us
[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:41.220]   and in others, and it makes sense for us to talk about that.
[02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:44.660]   But we've looked at how do things get out of balance, right?
[02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:46.180]   And from the perspective of,
[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:50.220]   well, what if the aggressive drive or the pleasure drive,
[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:52.300]   what if they're too high, right?
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.540]   And then it makes sense that often not always
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:45:57.860]   what can be driving them to be so high
[02:45:57.860 --> 02:45:59.820]   are things that aren't healthy in us.
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.800]   Then the higher they get, the harder it is to gratify them.
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.320]   So we end up with that problem of envy, right?
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.860]   But we can be out of balance in the other direction too,
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:16.620]   where the person does not experience an ability
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:20.300]   to engage with the world around them, right?
[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:22.180]   They don't think they can do anything
[02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:23.580]   to change anything for the better
[02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:25.240]   or inside or outside of themselves.
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:26.700]   And they're not doing much.
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:28.400]   They don't feel that they can do much.
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:32.540]   And also not receiving pleasure from things.
[02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:33.540]   There's no gratification
[02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:34.860]   from the things that person is doing.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:37.300]   Like we see situations like this too
[02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:41.120]   with the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive, or both.
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:44.000]   And then we end up not at envy
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.080]   because envy is the side of excess,
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:49.700]   but we end up at demoralization on the lower side.
[02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:54.200]   Now, demoralization is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis.
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:57.140]   It can predispose to psychiatric problems
[02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:00.620]   like the biochemical abnormality of depression, right?
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:02.120]   But what we're talking about here
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:05.380]   is not a psychiatric diagnosis, right?
[02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:07.340]   Like envy is not a psychiatric diagnosis.
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:09.880]   Like it's a thing that can be experienced
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.600]   that can lead to diagnoses.
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:13.700]   The same thing with demoralization.
[02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:15.380]   If you don't feel
[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:18.780]   that you can make a difference to anything, right?
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:20.100]   And you're not enjoying anything
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:22.820]   or feeling gratification from anything,
[02:47:22.820 --> 02:47:24.800]   then that pool is gonna win out.
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:27.080]   That's gonna be a demoralized person.
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:28.940]   The same way, of course, we know in experiments
[02:47:28.940 --> 02:47:32.860]   when you have a rat going for food,
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:35.300]   if you do it enough, when the rat goes for the food
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:38.020]   and you take the food away, the rat stops trying, right?
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:39.260]   - And the learned helplessness phenomenon.
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:42.520]   - Right, and that exists in us too.
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:44.660]   And it comes along with all sorts of other things
[02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:47.380]   'cause being not rats, right?
[02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:49.500]   We have a whole bunch of thoughts about that of,
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:52.100]   oh my God, I'm not good enough and nothing will ever be okay.
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:57.100]   And so demoralization then can be very, very strong
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:00.340]   in taking a person away
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:03.360]   from the other things we're trying to seek, right?
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:04.480]   Either because that person
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:06.820]   has essentially the learned helplessness, right?
[02:48:06.820 --> 02:48:09.680]   And all the things, the complicated things inside of us
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:11.300]   that can come along with that,
[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:14.740]   or the person isn't gaining pleasure from anything.
[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:16.720]   So when we're considering the ways
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:18.780]   in which we can be out of balance, right?
[02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:21.980]   We think, okay, aggression and pleasure drive,
[02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:26.240]   if one or the other or both is too high,
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:28.980]   we end up at envy.
[02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:33.140]   And if one or the other or both are too low,
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:35.340]   we end up with demoralization.
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:38.100]   And you can take almost any scenario.
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:39.520]   It could be a scenario of something
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.900]   that's just not really not going well for a person,
[02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:45.220]   not a clinical scenario, it's a thing in a person's life.
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:49.940]   Or we can take clinical scenarios and the vast majority,
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:53.260]   outside of outliers, like a head injury, for example,
[02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:54.940]   we can take those scenarios
[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:56.940]   and we can look at it in that way
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:48:59.540]   and we can understand what's going on.
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:01.540]   At least we can understand enough
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:05.300]   that when we go back and look in the 10 cupboards
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:06.660]   of the two pillars,
[02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:08.700]   we can then have some understanding of,
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:10.180]   okay, what is going on?
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:11.380]   We know the basic picture
[02:49:11.380 --> 02:49:15.680]   and how things are not in the balance we want them in.
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:18.420]   Now we can understand that enough to go back
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:20.460]   and then look in those 10 cupboards.
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:23.660]   And I believe that just about everything
[02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:25.540]   except those biological outliers,
[02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:28.900]   like a head injury, fits into that heuristic,
[02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:31.340]   which is why we can use it to understand,
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:34.820]   we can use it to help, we can use it to make change.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:38.420]   - What a powerful lens to think about and explore the self
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:41.260]   and where things are working for us
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:44.180]   and where things are possibly not working for us.
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:49.460]   If I or anyone else out there wanted to get some read on,
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:51.660]   assess their level of aggressive drive
[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.660]   and their level of pleasure drive
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:56.060]   and their ability to experience pleasure,
[02:49:56.060 --> 02:49:58.060]   what sorts of questions would one ask?
[02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:01.900]   You know, for instance, is it a question of,
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:04.200]   like, how driven am I?
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:07.520]   How much get up and go do I have?
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.960]   How much pleasure do I experience
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:12.120]   from an interaction with a puppy,
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:14.180]   an interaction with food?
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:15.380]   Is it too much, right?
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:16.780]   Like, does it draw me off course?
[02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:18.680]   Are those the sorts of very simple
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:21.380]   but perhaps also very informative questions
[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:24.900]   that we could start to use to probe our psyche?
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:28.740]   - Yeah, I think yes, but I would come top down, right?
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:33.380]   So if the goal of health is that aggression and pleasure,
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:36.340]   those drives are sub-serving the generative drive,
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:38.220]   then start to look there, right?
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:42.100]   If a person can take an honest inventory of self,
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:46.660]   like, what kind of force am I being in the world around me?
[02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:48.980]   And that could mean, for example,
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:52.820]   what kind of force am I being in my family, right?
[02:50:52.820 --> 02:50:55.300]   Am I denigrating to the people around me?
[02:50:55.300 --> 02:50:57.820]   Are the other people in the home afraid of me?
[02:50:57.820 --> 02:50:58.900]   Like, what kind of force?
[02:50:58.900 --> 02:50:59.980]   Am I being a force for good?
[02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:00.820]   Am I bolstering?
[02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:04.940]   Like, people can't always see that in themselves
[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:06.540]   and take stock of themselves,
[02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:08.020]   but what we're talking about is a situation
[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:09.020]   where we think a person can.
[02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:11.940]   Like, they can bring to bear who am I being in the world.
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:14.260]   In other ways, if you think of the example
[02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:16.580]   of the person who needed to leave the job,
[02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:18.720]   who could look at that and say,
[02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:22.380]   "No, I'm not being generative in the world
[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:23.860]   "in the way I want to.
[02:51:23.860 --> 02:51:26.620]   "I'm certainly not doing my job as well as I would want to.
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:28.780]   "I'm making my own life worse," right?
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:31.380]   So that person could then see that's out of balance.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:33.660]   Or in another way, a person might see,
[02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:37.340]   you know, a lot of what I'm doing is self-serving
[02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:39.140]   or maybe destructive.
[02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:41.260]   Like, people can realize that, right?
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:44.940]   So you can realize by taking an inventory of self
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:48.220]   is the generative drive what's deterministic in me.
[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:49.220]   And again, not always,
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:51.660]   but we're talking about a process of exploration.
[02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:53.100]   If the answer to that is yes,
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.000]   if you say, "Look, I'm trying to be the best person
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.280]   "that I can, and I think about the people
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:59.420]   "over whom I have any authority," right?
[02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:00.860]   And like, I try to be reasonable,
[02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:03.100]   and I try to be fair, and I try and be circumspect.
[02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:05.620]   And you know, I try and think in someone else's shoes.
[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:08.500]   I mean, you know, sometimes I have to set boundaries
[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:10.280]   or expectations or even punishment, right?
[02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:12.580]   But I'm like, careful about how I'm doing that.
[02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:13.900]   And I'm certainly not perfect,
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:15.380]   and I get things wrong at times.
[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:18.200]   But you know, I do think I'm contributing to the world.
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:20.580]   I'm doing whatever I take on, you know,
[02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:23.620]   as well as I can do it, I'm productive at work.
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:25.160]   You know, my kids are doing okay,
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:27.100]   or my friends are doing all right.
[02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:30.660]   Whatever it is that, if we can come up with that,
[02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:33.140]   then we can say, "Okay, exhale a little bit."
[02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:35.180]   Like, we're in a good place, right?
[02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:36.980]   It doesn't mean everything is optimal, of course.
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:39.840]   So then go look at the level of the aggressive drive,
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:42.500]   which might mean, you know, how assertive am I, right?
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:44.940]   Am I the kind of person who comes up to the precipice,
[02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:46.820]   but does it make the decision?
[02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:49.160]   Am I the kind of person who's a little too assertive,
[02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:51.620]   and sometimes I'm sort of walking on people a little bit.
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:53.860]   Like, a person can go look at the aggressive drive
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:55.620]   within them, or pleasure-seeking.
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:58.680]   Am I doing things that bring me gratification, right?
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:01.000]   Am I engaging with the people around me
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.600]   in a way that brings the gratification
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:05.860]   that one might wish for, right?
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:08.280]   So if it's in a romantic relationship, is there romance?
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:10.080]   Like, are we being nice to one another, right?
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:11.940]   So you can go and look at that and say,
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:14.600]   "Am I getting gratification from the things I'm doing?"
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:19.600]   Right, am I taking this, wherever this drive is within me,
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:22.520]   and trying to satisfy it in reasonable, healthy ways
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:23.820]   that are also good for others?
[02:53:23.820 --> 02:53:25.620]   And we're back to the generative drive.
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:27.560]   So that's one way of coming at it,
[02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:28.940]   and it's the way that we would like to,
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:32.180]   because now, what are we trying to do next?
[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:33.760]   And what can we make things better, right?
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:34.820]   Can we optimize things?
[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:36.220]   Okay, things are okay, right?
[02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:37.700]   But can we make them better?
[02:53:37.700 --> 02:53:41.760]   But let's say we see that the generative drive
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:43.580]   is not winning the day, right?
[02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:45.000]   And people can see that, they're like,
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.300]   "Look, I'm seeking pleasure, right?
[02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:49.280]   It's why I got, for example, I hear over and over,
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.840]   that's why I got addicted to this substance,
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:53.720]   and now it's not providing any pleasure to me,
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:55.720]   and it's now making me miserable, right?
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:58.340]   But I wanted what it was giving me."
[02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:01.020]   Again, this doesn't mean that the person
[02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:03.180]   just wants to have the world's best time, right?
[02:54:03.180 --> 02:54:05.940]   It may mean that they're really suffering a lot, right?
[02:54:05.940 --> 02:54:08.560]   And the pleasure that that drug gave them
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:10.640]   was some relief from pain.
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:13.920]   And this is how many, many people tragically
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:18.800]   ended up becoming addicted to and dying from opiates, right?
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:20.880]   Because say the opiate after the surgery
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:22.600]   or the opiate after the injury
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:25.040]   then is soothing something, right?
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:26.080]   And it's soothing something
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:27.720]   because the person feels less bad
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:29.320]   about something inside of them.
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:33.080]   You hear this all the time, that that then fosters addiction.
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:35.300]   So that person looking for pleasure,
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:37.760]   this isn't something where we would say
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:38.880]   in some lighthearted manner,
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.680]   that person took chances with their life.
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:42.380]   I mean, sometimes we'll see that,
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:44.680]   but more and more what people are looking for then
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:46.160]   is relief from suffering, right?
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:47.480]   But we can get to that point
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:50.560]   where we can ascertain for whatever reason
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:53.060]   that the pleasure seeking is too much.
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:56.000]   And if pleasure seeking and aggression are too much,
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.720]   we become aware of dissatisfaction, right?
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:00.560]   If you're relying too much on aggression,
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:03.960]   I always want my way, it's not always gonna happen, right?
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.680]   Or I always want that pleasurable thing.
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:07.520]   I always wanna feel better.
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.360]   That also doesn't happen, right?
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.120]   So then that can guide us towards being aware
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:13.840]   of where are those drives.
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:16.040]   And if the drives are high,
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:18.880]   how much dissonance is created
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:23.200]   by what's actually coming of the drive, right?
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:24.840]   Versus the level of the drive is at.
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:28.400]   So I guess it's a long way of saying yes to your question,
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.180]   but I would sort of come top down
[02:55:30.180 --> 02:55:33.020]   because the generative drive is so important
[02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:35.380]   and it does gate forward.
[02:55:35.380 --> 02:55:37.860]   Like kind of where are we at
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:40.500]   in the spectrum of like, how healthy am I?
[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:43.840]   Or are there elements of unhealth I wanna kind of go after?
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:47.380]   Or am I seeing things in myself that really say
[02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:50.860]   things that are unhealthy are really dominating my life,
[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:53.180]   are deterministic, like addiction.
[02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:54.620]   Well, just one example,
[02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:56.780]   addiction, things that are self-destructive, right?
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:59.980]   Because then that's a place to then look at it more
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:00.900]   through the clinical lens.
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:03.900]   And maybe I won't just talk to a trusted other
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:05.020]   and go get a book,
[02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:09.460]   but maybe I should and maybe I should have clinical care.
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:12.820]   - Yeah, the example of addiction is very potent.
[02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:14.580]   And it also brings to mind
[02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:19.580]   the perhaps less apparently dangerous situation,
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:21.880]   but one that I think is really common
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:24.800]   where people have a certain amount of aggressive drive,
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.040]   they have a certain amount of pleasure drive,
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:30.720]   but there's a kind of passivity
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:33.200]   and draining out of the generative drive
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.260]   or competing out of the generative drive
[02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:38.140]   because of social media.
[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:41.340]   And the reason I bring this up is again,
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:42.820]   not because I dislike social media,
[02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:45.980]   I rely on and use social media for teaching and learning
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:47.680]   extensively really,
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:49.940]   but in going back to the pillars that underlie
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:53.000]   whether or not we achieve and experience agency,
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.180]   gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight,
[02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:58.500]   within the pillar of function of self,
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:00.600]   there's this thing, salience,
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:04.260]   and what we're paying attention to internal and external.
[02:57:04.260 --> 02:57:09.260]   And social media does seem to me a unique circumstance,
[02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:13.120]   never before observed in human evolution,
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:17.420]   where you have a near infinite number of environments
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:18.260]   available to you.
[02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:20.580]   And we know that a picture is worth a thousand words
[02:57:20.580 --> 02:57:22.780]   and a movie is worth a billion pictures
[02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:24.420]   when it comes to drawing our attention.
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:26.220]   I mean, you just look at, you give a young child,
[02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:28.500]   even an infant an iPad.
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:30.500]   I mean, that kid is in the tunnel.
[02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:32.280]   I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:34.060]   And that computers and computer screens
[02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:35.340]   are going to be a part of their lives
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:37.300]   now and forever, presumably.
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:41.920]   But it is the case that there are a lot of people
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:45.400]   who perhaps have the propensity
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:47.420]   for a strong generative drive,
[02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:50.040]   but because they also have a propensity
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:53.760]   for a pleasure drive, they wake up,
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:56.220]   they pick up the phone, they look at the phone,
[02:57:56.220 --> 02:57:57.580]   something captivates their attention,
[02:57:57.580 --> 02:57:58.420]   then they're thinking about that.
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:00.660]   It might be something that brings them delight,
[02:58:00.660 --> 02:58:01.540]   but more often than not,
[02:58:01.540 --> 02:58:04.240]   it's something that brings them either mild irritation
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.580]   or mild entertainment,
[02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:09.820]   maybe even intense entertainment for a short while,
[02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:13.460]   but very quickly, minutes and hours go by
[02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:16.020]   in which we are not engaging in the world
[02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:18.980]   unless we are posting valuable content.
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:24.220]   And so social media is a bit of a drain on these drives.
[02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:26.520]   I mean, it taps into these drives in very strong ways.
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:29.340]   And all one has to do is observe the behavior of people
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:34.000]   in public spaces now, in airports, on trains,
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.100]   even in their cars.
[02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:38.520]   And I mean, people are essentially watching TV all day long.
[02:58:38.520 --> 02:58:40.320]   And it does concern me.
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:45.060]   And I raise it because I feel like it can distract
[02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:47.720]   from our generative drive in a way that
[02:58:47.720 --> 02:58:50.700]   doesn't necessarily speak to any kind of like
[02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:54.080]   deep character flaw or any kind of subconscious narrative,
[02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:58.240]   but just that that salience cupboard
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:01.540]   is clearly something within that salience cupboard
[02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:06.540]   is happening that's unprecedented and very, very powerful
[02:59:06.540 --> 02:59:09.660]   and potentially quite destructive.
[02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:10.500]   - Yeah.
[02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:15.500]   I think to understand this, I would cite this belief.
[02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:16.720]   I believe this to be true,
[02:59:16.720 --> 02:59:19.260]   that human beings have a long history
[02:59:19.260 --> 02:59:22.720]   of under appreciating the power of the discoveries
[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:24.560]   that are then in their own hands.
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:26.700]   So we discover gunpowder,
[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:28.860]   how long until we're shooting each other, right?
[02:59:28.860 --> 02:59:30.900]   We discover nuclear fission, right?
[02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:33.100]   Now, are we gonna destroy the planet, right?
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:35.540]   So social media, in a sense, it's a discovery.
[02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:39.160]   It's a thing that comes from what we figured out as humans
[02:59:39.160 --> 02:59:41.720]   that now is there in front of us.
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:44.580]   And big, powerful discoveries
[02:59:44.580 --> 02:59:47.280]   deserve to be treated with respect, right?
[02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:48.700]   Gunpowder is very powerful.
[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:51.620]   And if people need to hunt in order to survive,
[02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:53.780]   like gunpowder can help them hunt without getting hurt.
[02:59:53.780 --> 02:59:55.460]   Then we'd be more successful, right?
[02:59:55.460 --> 02:59:58.940]   Nuclear fission has provided some good things to humanity,
[02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:00.980]   but it can also destroy humanity.
[03:00:00.980 --> 03:00:02.700]   So I think the same is true here
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:06.180]   that what you're talking about is something of immense power
[03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:08.740]   and you can see how if it gets out of balance.
[03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:10.260]   So let's use the salient.
[03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:14.940]   So let's say the social media is too salient, right?
[03:00:14.940 --> 03:00:16.940]   That's gonna make a problem, right?
[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:18.820]   If it's too salient in the sense
[03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:20.460]   that the person is always looking at things
[03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:22.540]   that don't make them feel good enough, right?
[03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:24.300]   Well, that's not gonna go well,
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:27.700]   and that's gonna affect what's in those other 10 cupboards,
[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:29.340]   right, and what is built on top of it.
[03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.380]   So then it gets into the unconscious mind,
[03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:33.460]   like, oh, I thought I was good enough
[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:35.940]   until like now I'm looking at all the social media
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:37.040]   and I realize I'm not.
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:39.540]   I mean, this is, people who treat teens
[03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:40.540]   often talk about this,
[03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:43.620]   that you see something that you didn't often see before
[03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:46.020]   where a person who might've gotten through
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:48.420]   a lot of formative years thinking like,
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:50.740]   oh, how I look is okay, for example,
[03:00:50.740 --> 03:00:53.660]   then is bombarding themselves with social media
[03:00:53.660 --> 03:00:55.420]   that tells them how they look is not okay
[03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:56.640]   and then that changes.
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:59.460]   - Absolutely, or perhaps social media
[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:02.540]   is just simply absorbing a ton of time and energy,
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:07.100]   but mostly time that could be devoted to a generative force.
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:08.660]   - Right, that's the other side of it.
[03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:10.640]   So think about the example of the person
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:12.180]   who I know it wasn't social media,
[03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:13.700]   but we were saying, well, what if it were social media
[03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:15.700]   that instead of 90 minutes a day,
[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:18.580]   you know, it's eight hours 'cause there's an analog there,
[03:01:18.580 --> 03:01:19.840]   right, and we see a lot of this
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:24.580]   and it's taking something that can be good, right,
[03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:27.300]   and can, in a sense, you could even, should be good.
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:29.220]   Like there's enough out there, right,
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:31.140]   in terms of learning and bolstering
[03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:33.300]   that like why should it not be good, right?
[03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:36.660]   But it's not good because the defenses then shift.
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:39.520]   Like if you're relying on it 10 hours a day,
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:41.020]   there has to be some denial, right,
[03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:43.420]   'cause there are other things to do in the world.
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:44.580]   There has to be some avoidance.
[03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:45.940]   There has to be some rationalization.
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:48.940]   Like something is going on there that's not healthy.
[03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:51.500]   So if you tell me this person is utilizing social media
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.620]   10 hours a day, they're not looking at things
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:54.980]   that make them feel bad about themselves.
[03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:56.060]   They're just doing it.
[03:01:56.060 --> 03:02:00.140]   Then I think, okay, something is out of balance.
[03:02:00.140 --> 03:02:03.940]   Now it may be that that person's defenses are out of balance.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:05.620]   So think about the example of the person
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:06.680]   with the job they didn't like,
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:08.520]   then their defensive structure changes.
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:10.560]   Then the thing that was good for them,
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:12.700]   they rely on too much and now it becomes something
[03:02:12.700 --> 03:02:14.700]   that's not good for them, right?
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:16.900]   So then you go and look at what else
[03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:19.220]   is out of balance here, right?
[03:02:19.220 --> 03:02:21.540]   What else is driving this?
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.780]   So maybe it's being driven
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.840]   by the change in defense mechanisms, et cetera.
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:26.140]   Maybe it's the other way around
[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:28.260]   that this person just kind of habituated
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:30.580]   to doing more and more and more and more of it.
[03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:32.700]   And then you would come at it in a different way of,
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:36.420]   okay, can you slowly but surely do less,
[03:02:36.420 --> 03:02:39.640]   replace the time with things that were good before?
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:41.100]   'Cause you could then back that person out
[03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:42.540]   to where they were before.
[03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:44.220]   But you're not gonna back the person out
[03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:45.620]   to where they were before
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:47.800]   if it's being driven by something else.
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:50.200]   So we, again, come to the curiosity.
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:53.980]   You tell me that person is on social media 14 hours a day.
[03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:55.420]   I'm curious, right?
[03:02:55.420 --> 03:02:59.300]   I wanna understand what is the balance of those drives, right?
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:03.100]   You've just told me a very powerful point about salience
[03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:04.460]   that doesn't sound like a good one.
[03:03:04.460 --> 03:03:06.500]   So already you're giving me clues
[03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:07.660]   about where the drives are,
[03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:09.380]   which means where's that person at,
[03:03:09.380 --> 03:03:11.100]   what's going on in all those cabinets.
[03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:13.260]   And then you give more information.
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:14.600]   Now sit and talk with the person.
[03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:17.020]   Now you're gonna understand
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:18.140]   what is the lay of the land here
[03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:20.420]   and how do we go about making it better?
[03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:24.140]   - I love the concept of the generative drive.
[03:03:24.140 --> 03:03:26.500]   First of all, because it's pro-social,
[03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:29.660]   it brings about great things for us and for the world.
[03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:31.740]   And I mean, what is better than peace,
[03:03:31.740 --> 03:03:33.080]   contentment, and delight?
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:35.860]   Especially when we remind ourselves
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:37.860]   that those are active phrases
[03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:40.780]   or those can be achieved and experienced
[03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:41.760]   inside of action.
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:43.420]   It's not just sitting, levitating,
[03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:44.860]   navel gazing, that sort of things.
[03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:46.640]   It's not enlightenment, right?
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:48.500]   It's peace, contentment, and delight.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:51.300]   - Very big difference.
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:53.100]   - Very big difference, yes.
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:54.880]   One of the other reasons I love this concept
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:56.820]   of the generative drive so much
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:59.780]   is also because it is a verb state.
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:03.100]   It has to do with creating things in us and in the world,
[03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:05.660]   in cultivating our experience of things
[03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:07.320]   and what we do and what we say
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:10.380]   and how we respond to what others do and say.
[03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:13.540]   And I also like it because it's distinct
[03:04:13.540 --> 03:04:15.460]   from the way that we're normally taught
[03:04:15.460 --> 03:04:18.700]   to think about psychological wellbeing
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:19.860]   or being a healthy individual,
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:22.860]   which usually centers around a discussion
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:26.280]   of goals and values and like,
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:28.100]   what am I trying to focus on?
[03:04:28.100 --> 03:04:30.140]   And what sorts of people do I want to engage with
[03:04:30.140 --> 03:04:30.980]   in the world?
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:32.220]   And certainly all of that is really important,
[03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:33.820]   goals and who you engage with.
[03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:36.580]   But I think for many people out there,
[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:40.300]   much of their time is spent thinking about other people,
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:44.960]   like how healthy or unhealthy are the people they're dating
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:47.100]   or their friends or what's going on
[03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:49.140]   between two family members?
[03:04:49.140 --> 03:04:51.540]   Which of course is fine to think about,
[03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:55.100]   but a lot of emphasis is placed on like our assessments
[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:57.420]   of others and how those are impacting us.
[03:04:57.420 --> 03:05:01.100]   And in some cases, people default to just thinking
[03:05:01.100 --> 03:05:03.760]   about others and their problems and seeing their problems.
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:05.440]   And what we're really talking about here
[03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:08.780]   is a process of introspection and inquiry
[03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:10.340]   that's very structured.
[03:05:10.340 --> 03:05:13.400]   And as it's been laid out by you,
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:16.180]   these two pillars, structure of self, function of self
[03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:18.080]   with these 10 cupboards,
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:19.540]   that might sound like a lot of cupboards,
[03:05:19.540 --> 03:05:21.840]   but as we talked about in the first episode,
[03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:26.840]   all of that flows up to these very simple ideals
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:30.220]   and concepts and action states and ways of being.
[03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:32.720]   And to me, there's nothing more powerful
[03:05:32.720 --> 03:05:36.380]   than the statement that what we are all seeking
[03:05:36.380 --> 03:05:39.400]   are states of agency and gratitude.
[03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:41.260]   Because again, to go back to the analogy
[03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:45.640]   of physical fitness, there are not an infinite number
[03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:48.700]   of different physical states or states of fitness
[03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:51.140]   that one can seek.
[03:05:51.140 --> 03:05:53.600]   There's endurance, there's strength, there's flexibility,
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:56.520]   there's dynamic movement, there's explosiveness,
[03:05:56.520 --> 03:05:59.340]   there's speed, there are a bunch of subtleties to it.
[03:05:59.340 --> 03:06:03.300]   But here, it really seems that the psyche,
[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:06.680]   ourselves and our mental health is really tractable
[03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:10.260]   if we turn the lens and we look inward.
[03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:13.020]   - Yes, yes, I think that hits upon
[03:06:13.020 --> 03:06:15.980]   a very, very important point as we talk about
[03:06:15.980 --> 03:06:19.140]   understanding oneself in the process of change, right?
[03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:22.820]   And I would describe that as rational aspiration, right?
[03:06:22.820 --> 03:06:25.780]   So let's use the physical health example, right?
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:29.540]   If I think, okay, I want to be healthier,
[03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:32.620]   I want to have more strength, I want to have more endurance,
[03:06:32.620 --> 03:06:34.900]   and I might even have ideas of what that would be.
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:36.620]   I want to be able to run a certain distance
[03:06:36.620 --> 03:06:38.780]   in a certain time, lift a certain amount of weight,
[03:06:38.780 --> 03:06:40.460]   I have an idea of what that is.
[03:06:40.460 --> 03:06:44.300]   But rational aspiration is rooted in our present.
[03:06:44.300 --> 03:06:47.260]   Or like, I'm aware that there's a me now
[03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:50.060]   that like isn't in that state.
[03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:53.360]   And I'm aware that there are things that I'm gonna do
[03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:54.900]   to get to that state, right?
[03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:56.900]   And I'm not that dreading them, like, okay,
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:57.940]   they'll be difficult, right?
[03:06:57.940 --> 03:06:59.660]   But that's okay, I can do difficult things,
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:01.700]   I can take pride in doing difficult things,
[03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:04.040]   and that's how we all achieve things.
[03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:06.540]   So I see myself in the present,
[03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:10.440]   'cause of course, goals are good, and that's true,
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:12.820]   as long as we're still living our lives in the present,
[03:07:12.820 --> 03:07:15.940]   because otherwise, goals just become fantasies,
[03:07:15.940 --> 03:07:18.660]   or things we want to possess.
[03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:21.100]   So if I'm aware of the state of physical health
[03:07:21.100 --> 03:07:23.020]   I'm in right now, and I'm aware of the state
[03:07:23.020 --> 03:07:24.460]   of physical health I want to be in,
[03:07:24.460 --> 03:07:26.060]   and I know there's a bunch of pathways
[03:07:26.060 --> 03:07:29.300]   I could take to get there, but I have to think about it,
[03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:31.280]   figure it out, do those things,
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:32.820]   and then I'm gonna navigate myself there.
[03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:34.820]   That's how the whole process is good, right?
[03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:36.920]   I don't feel bad about myself now.
[03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:38.800]   I recognize something I would like to change.
[03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:40.200]   I'm not saying, oh, you're a loser,
[03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:41.840]   'cause you don't have those things, right?
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:44.140]   I feel good about myself now.
[03:07:44.140 --> 03:07:46.000]   I recognize there's something I want,
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.940]   and there's gonna be a process, a process across time,
[03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:51.680]   across effort, that's gonna navigate me there.
[03:07:51.680 --> 03:07:55.140]   Then when I get there, I feel good about being there, right?
[03:07:55.140 --> 03:07:58.320]   It's very, very different if I think I want that.
[03:07:58.320 --> 03:08:00.220]   I want to possess, in a sense, right?
[03:08:00.220 --> 03:08:02.220]   I want to possess the ability to run a certain distance
[03:08:02.220 --> 03:08:03.060]   in a certain time.
[03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:03.900]   I just want the thing.
[03:08:03.900 --> 03:08:05.860]   I'm covetous of the thing, right?
[03:08:05.860 --> 03:08:07.860]   That is not good, right?
[03:08:07.860 --> 03:08:10.160]   'Cause a person then often is denigrating to the self,
[03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:12.200]   not always, but that's a motivation to go out
[03:08:12.200 --> 03:08:13.740]   and get that thing that's better,
[03:08:13.740 --> 03:08:17.780]   and they're really lamenting the process of getting there.
[03:08:17.780 --> 03:08:20.100]   They just want something as an endpoint,
[03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:22.340]   and that doesn't make for happiness.
[03:08:22.340 --> 03:08:25.180]   It doesn't make for even the humility,
[03:08:25.180 --> 03:08:27.580]   and humility in action, the gratitude, right,
[03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:30.080]   of the humility is I can't just do that overnight.
[03:08:30.080 --> 03:08:31.260]   I'm gonna have to work hard.
[03:08:31.260 --> 03:08:32.820]   People have to work hard.
[03:08:32.820 --> 03:08:34.220]   I'm no different than anybody else.
[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:35.060]   I'm not special.
[03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:37.460]   I gotta get in there and work and use the elbow grease,
[03:08:37.460 --> 03:08:38.820]   and then I'll get healthier.
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:40.600]   All of that is good.
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:44.100]   I just want to possess something is not good,
[03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:46.780]   and that's why people, in scenarios like this,
[03:08:46.780 --> 03:08:49.440]   they might go through, maybe in an unthinking way,
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:50.280]   or they're gutting it out,
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:52.100]   or they go and they get that thing, right?
[03:08:52.100 --> 03:08:53.720]   But then that thing is not enough, right?
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:54.560]   And they want more.
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:56.700]   Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting more
[03:08:56.700 --> 03:08:59.260]   if it's the healthy inaction of self, right?
[03:08:59.260 --> 03:09:00.300]   I'm gonna now map my way.
[03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:01.420]   This feels better.
[03:09:01.420 --> 03:09:03.260]   I want to map myself from here
[03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:06.700]   to the next level of better physical fitness.
[03:09:06.700 --> 03:09:08.460]   That's different than I just want that thing,
[03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:12.040]   because then if I get it, it won't be good enough, right?
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:13.020]   It doesn't make me happy.
[03:09:13.020 --> 03:09:14.640]   It doesn't satisfy me,
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:17.400]   and that's the unhealthy state
[03:09:17.400 --> 03:09:19.600]   of just wanting things to possess them,
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:21.380]   and then we don't feel good about them,
[03:09:21.380 --> 03:09:23.300]   which is the thought of if you give people,
[03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:24.440]   if you give a person something,
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:26.020]   they'll resent you for it, right?
[03:09:26.020 --> 03:09:30.180]   Again, that we're painting it in a sort of certain way.
[03:09:30.180 --> 03:09:32.020]   The context of that statement,
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:35.060]   which I used to hear a lot, even when I was younger,
[03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:36.340]   people would say that, right?
[03:09:36.340 --> 03:09:38.280]   And what were they trying to get at, right?
[03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:40.880]   What they were getting at is it doesn't feel good
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:42.780]   if you didn't work for something, right?
[03:09:42.780 --> 03:09:45.580]   Like if you didn't work very hard and you got a C,
[03:09:45.580 --> 03:09:48.260]   but I give you an A, or somebody gives me an A, right?
[03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:50.660]   I know that that's not good.
[03:09:50.660 --> 03:09:52.420]   I know that I got the thing.
[03:09:52.420 --> 03:09:54.900]   I got the A, and I might feel happy in the moment
[03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:56.340]   'cause I wanted that thing,
[03:09:56.340 --> 03:09:59.740]   but there's no real pleasure in it.
[03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:00.820]   There's no satisfaction.
[03:10:00.820 --> 03:10:01.700]   There's no contentment.
[03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:02.820]   There's no sense of self.
[03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:03.760]   There's nothing generative.
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:06.860]   I didn't work hard enough to go from a C to an A, right?
[03:10:06.860 --> 03:10:10.660]   So it's that, and that really brings us back to the self
[03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:14.720]   that we're growing on top of the structure, right?
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:17.580]   And how that self is functioning, right?
[03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:18.580]   How it's striving,
[03:10:18.580 --> 03:10:20.900]   because now we're really talking about strivings,
[03:10:20.900 --> 03:10:22.640]   and if I'm gonna strive for something
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:23.960]   and work hard to get it,
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:26.300]   well, I get the good feeling on the other side of it,
[03:10:26.300 --> 03:10:29.420]   and now we're living in the generative space.
[03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:31.500]   - Well, I love the structure of what you've laid out.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:32.540]   Again- - Thank you.
[03:10:32.540 --> 03:10:35.640]   - The pillars of structure of self and function of self
[03:10:35.640 --> 03:10:38.460]   with 10 cupboards between the two of them
[03:10:38.460 --> 03:10:41.460]   that when explored can seem a little bit complex,
[03:10:41.460 --> 03:10:44.700]   but they're really some very straightforward types of inquiry
[03:10:44.700 --> 03:10:48.240]   that anyone can go about about self-awareness
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:50.940]   and address potential defense mechanisms,
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:51.940]   what we're conscious of,
[03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:53.580]   maybe what we're not conscious of,
[03:10:53.580 --> 03:10:55.260]   look at our behaviors and our strivings,
[03:10:55.260 --> 03:10:57.700]   and how that flows up to these simple ideals,
[03:10:57.700 --> 03:11:00.220]   again, of empowerment, humility, agency,
[03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:02.920]   and gratitude as verbs.
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:06.540]   And then from that, peace, contentment, and delight,
[03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:09.580]   and the generative drive, which, gosh,
[03:11:09.580 --> 03:11:13.000]   if there ever was a more powerful concept
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.740]   and something to strive for, I don't think it exists,
[03:11:15.740 --> 03:11:19.860]   because the generative drive is extraordinary
[03:11:19.860 --> 03:11:22.000]   in the number of different ways it plays out,
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.240]   and it seems always positively, right?
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:28.040]   And of course, the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,
[03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:29.920]   exists to varying extents in all of us,
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:34.920]   but cannot be allowed to overcome the generative drive
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:37.200]   if we're going to really thrive.
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:40.460]   So thank you again so much for this framework,
[03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:42.900]   and again, to remind people listening and watching
[03:11:42.900 --> 03:11:46.480]   that this framework is mapped out in a downloadable PDF
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:47.820]   if people want to see it visually,
[03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:50.880]   even though we've touched on it several times before.
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:54.500]   I really appreciate how logical, clear,
[03:11:54.500 --> 03:11:56.660]   and actionable this framework is.
[03:11:56.660 --> 03:12:00.340]   And also that in providing a framework for us,
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:02.900]   it gives us something to hold our mind to.
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:05.180]   I think I and so many people out there are familiar
[03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:09.060]   with being in a struggle and not being able to orient,
[03:12:09.060 --> 03:12:12.300]   like where am I in the struggle, not knowing what to do.
[03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:15.980]   And you've provided some incredible points of reference
[03:12:15.980 --> 03:12:18.340]   for us to really focus on, start asking questions
[03:12:18.340 --> 03:12:20.080]   about I and how I see myself.
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:22.300]   What am I paying attention to, and so on and so forth,
[03:12:22.300 --> 03:12:25.220]   to really first anchor and orient and then be able
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:28.240]   to move forward in this process as many times
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:32.040]   as is required to get where we each and all want to go.
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:33.820]   So thank you so much for this.
[03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:35.300]   I know in our next discussion,
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:37.860]   we're going to touch on the relational aspects
[03:12:37.860 --> 03:12:41.100]   of human existence, not just selves,
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:43.100]   but interactions between selves,
[03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:46.060]   including some of the, let's call it a darker
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:48.580]   and unfortunate aspects of human existence,
[03:12:48.580 --> 03:12:51.100]   like narcissists and some of the challenges
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:53.340]   of different full-blown personality disorders,
[03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:56.480]   but also just in terms of building healthy relationships
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:59.200]   between friends, romantic partners, parents and children
[03:12:59.200 --> 03:13:02.860]   and siblings and coworkers and all the rest.
[03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:07.000]   So thank you again for this incredibly rich knowledge
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.980]   that you provided us and a map forward.
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:11.220]   - You're very welcome and thank you.
[03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:13.820]   I appreciate the opportunity to talk about it with you.
[03:13:13.820 --> 03:13:15.820]   - Great, well, to be continued.
[03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:18.100]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:19.980]   about how to improve your mental health
[03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:21.380]   with Dr. Paul Conte.

[03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:55.780]   I am Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:57.980]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads,
[03:13:57.980 --> 03:13:59.020]   and Facebook.
[03:13:59.020 --> 03:14:00.700]   And on all those platforms,
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:02.700]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:04.340]   some of which overlap with the content
[03:14:04.340 --> 03:14:05.680]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:07.760]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:09.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:12.220]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:13.460]   Not on today's episode,
[03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:15.940]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:17.320]   we discussed supplements.
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:19.460]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:21.400]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:22.860]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[03:14:22.860 --> 03:14:25.180]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:26.740]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:27.860]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:30.340]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[03:14:30.340 --> 03:14:33.300]   So it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:35.500]   If you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:37.080]   it is a zero-cost newsletter
[03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:38.780]   called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:40.620]   And in the Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:14:40.620 --> 03:14:43.420]   you get free podcast summaries as well as toolkits.
[03:14:43.420 --> 03:14:45.540]   The toolkits are brief PDFs
[03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:48.260]   that list off the specific science-backed protocols
[03:14:48.260 --> 03:14:50.640]   for things like improving your sleep, improving focus,
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:53.080]   optimizing dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:14:55.560]   We have a complete summary of our fitness series.
[03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:57.680]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[03:14:57.680 --> 03:15:00.520]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:01.600]   scroll down to newsletter,

[03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:05.780]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:15:05.780 --> 03:15:07.060]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:15:07.060 --> 03:15:09.560]   for today's discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:11.600]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:13.460]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:15:13.460 --> 03:15:16.040]   (upbeat music)
[03:15:16.040 --> 03:15:18.620]   (upbeat music)
