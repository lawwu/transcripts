[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440]   - Good Monday morning and welcome to a new week
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.280]   on the podcast.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.120]   Today we have a question from a listener,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720]   Scott in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.560]   Here's what he wants to know.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.920]   Dear Pastor John, hello and thank you
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   for the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380]   My question is personal.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.640]   A very close friend of mine who has historically
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   been strong in his Christian faith
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   has recently embraced a pop theology
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.900]   in which God has no wrath and there's no hell for anyone.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.040]   My friend now argues that the vengeful God
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.900]   of the Old Testament was a Jewish myth,
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.840]   not the real God who is only found in Jesus.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   To him, Jesus died mainly to demonstrate
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.760]   God's patience with sinners.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   He now denies penal substitutionary atonement.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.880]   In all these things, I have shown him his error
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.480]   from scripture, but he will have none of it.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.120]   Because he continues to claim to be a Christian,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.720]   I have begun to treat him in accordance
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.560]   with 2 Thessalonians 3, verses 14 to 15,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.760]   not hanging out like we used to.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.840]   Have I done the right thing and should I tell him why?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.200]   - I think the answer is yes.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.480]   You have done the right thing and I think the answer is yes,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.620]   you should tell him why.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.960]   But let's step back first for just a moment
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.880]   and get the bigger picture of the way
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.960]   the New Testament deals with those
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.880]   who claim to be Christian and have abandoned
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.280]   things essential to the Christian faith.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   First, let's clarify the verses in 2 Thessalonians
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.520]   that Scott refers to.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   The situation in Thessalonica is that some in the church
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840]   have departed from Paul's teaching about the second coming
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.920]   and are so sure that it's happening in the next weeks
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600]   or months that they've stopped doing any work
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   and are walking in idleness, he says,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.120]   and mooching off of other believers
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   instead of doing their work because they think
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.400]   the Lord's gonna be there any minute.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880]   So Paul says in chapter three, verse six,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600]   we command you brothers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.100]   that you keep away from any brother
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.140]   who is walking in idleness and not in accord
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.640]   with the tradition that you received from us.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.300]   And then eight verses later,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.840]   this is what Scott refers to.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.280]   If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   take note of that person, have nothing to do with him
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.920]   that he may be ashamed.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.100]   Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.720]   Now, the problem with using these verses
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   to guide Scott in the situation he describes with his friend
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.160]   is that the situation in 2 Thessalonians
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.440]   is not so serious that Paul considers
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   the delinquent idlers as unbelievers.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.920]   He tells the church to assume, for now anyway,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   that they are brothers and that they should be won back
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.960]   as brothers by this temporary ostracism.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   Do not regard them as an enemy,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.160]   but warn them as a brother, he says.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.440]   I don't think that's the case with Scott's friend.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   He has reinvented another Jesus than the one in the Bible.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.400]   And another Jesus can only offer another gospel.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.720]   His errors go right to the heart of the gospel.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.880]   So I don't think Scott's friend
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.080]   should be considered a Christian.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.240]   Paul has very harsh words
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.040]   for those who claim to be Christian
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   and reject the biblical Christ and the biblical gospel.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   He says, for example, in Galatians 1, 8,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.400]   "Even if we, or an angel from heaven,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.200]   "should preach to you a gospel contrary
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.580]   "to the one we preach to you, let him be accursed."
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.340]   As we have said before, so now I say again,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.280]   if anyone is preaching to you a gospel
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520]   That's the situation for Scott's friend,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.460]   as far as I can see.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.700]   And that kind of false teaching
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.560]   in a person who claims to be a Christian
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.920]   cannot help but stir up serious divisions
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.200]   among professing believers.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Claiming to be a Christian while rejecting Christ
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.280]   can only split Christ.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.440]   So both the apostles, Paul and John,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   have strong words to tell us to withdraw our fellowship
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.000]   from such a person, claiming to be a Christian
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.840]   and yet rejecting the biblical Christ.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.280]   For example, 2 John 1, 10 says,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.480]   "Everyone who goes on ahead
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.420]   "and does not abide in the teaching of Christ,"
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.980]   which is what Scott's friend has done,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.180]   he's moved on to a new Christ
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.600]   that he's inventing out of his own head,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.020]   "they do not have God."
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.700]   If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.780]   do not receive him into your house
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.820]   or give him any greeting,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.260]   for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.460]   Then Paul says in Titus 3, 10,
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.240]   "As for a person who stirs up division,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.320]   "after warning him once, then twice,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.840]   "have nothing more to do with him."
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   Or again in Romans 16, 17, "I appeal to you, brothers,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.280]   "watch out for those who cause divisions
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.400]   "and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.260]   "that you have been taught, avoid them."
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.820]   Or again, 1 Corinthians 5, 11,
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.300]   "I am writing to you not to associate with anyone
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.500]   "who bears the name brother,"
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.020]   Christian in other words,
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.420]   "if he's guilty of sexual immorality or greed or idolater
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.720]   "or reviler or drunkard or swindler,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.120]   "not even to eat with such a one."
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   Now that last list from 1 Corinthians 5
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   focuses mainly on blatant behavioral sins
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.340]   that we don't repent of,
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.860]   but the reference to idolater in that list
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.580]   points to a much wider application
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.460]   than just a few behavioral sins,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.520]   like creating a new Christ
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.420]   that is not the Christ of the Bible
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.840]   and claiming to worship that false Christ.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   So from these seven passages that I just quoted,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   I would say that Scott has made the right choice
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   in pulling back his fellowship from his friend
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.880]   who claims to be a Christian
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   and has rejected the very heart of Christ's saving work,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.840]   namely his taking our condemnation on himself on the cross,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.440]   according to Romans 8, 3.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.620]   And I would say, Scott,
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.980]   that you most definitely should explain to your friend
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.060]   why you are pulling back.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.560]   Won't do any good otherwise.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.380]   He won't know what's going on.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.300]   Your hope is that your action
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.520]   will help him feel the seriousness
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.380]   of his walking away from biblical truth
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.120]   and his reinventing his own Christ.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.140]   You'll tell him that you love him
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.680]   and that it would not be loving to carry on
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   as if his view of Christ were unimportant
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.700]   when in fact his soul hangs in the balance.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.180]   You'll promise to pray for him.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.300]   And from time to time,
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.340]   you may communicate with him precious things about Christ
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.820]   that you pray will awaken a longing in him
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.860]   for the true biblical Christ.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.760]   And I would say one more thing, Scott.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   Without going behind his back,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.740]   you would say something to him about his church relationship
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.480]   or you'd ask him about his church relationship
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.620]   and whether his pastor,
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.180]   I'm just assuming that if he claims to be Christian,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.620]   he's going to church somewhere probably,
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.160]   and you would ask him if his pastor knows what he believes.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.960]   And you might even offer to go with him
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   to visit his pastor.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.480]   And you would explain it's a matter of integrity.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.920]   If you belong to a church, it's dishonest.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   It's cowardly not to be up front with the church leadership
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.160]   if you come to reject
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.880]   some of the central teachings of the church.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   And if he says, gets his back up maybe and says,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.560]   what, you want to get me kicked out of my church
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.400]   the way you're kicking me out of my relationship with you?
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.900]   Well, you might say to him,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.320]   you know, you are the one who's changed,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.520]   not me, not the church.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.320]   You're the one who has turned on Jesus
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.120]   and kicked him out of your life.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.880]   You're the one who's kicked out of your mind and heart
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.920]   what the church has believed about the Lord Jesus
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   and the wrath of God and the atonement of Christ
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.840]   for 2000 years.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.640]   I think you should own up to what you have done
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.320]   and stop pretending that you're a Christian.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.840]   Now, I don't know, Scott,
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   whether those words are appropriate for your friend or not.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.760]   I know I'm putting words in your mouth,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.560]   but it seemed to me that I ought to at least make an effort
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   to say the kinds of things that might be said.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.240]   And I'll pray for you that the Lord will give you love,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.200]   give you wisdom, give you courage to speak the truth
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   with your friend and that he may receive it
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.360]   the way you mean it.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.080]   - That's a good word.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.560]   And Scott, thank you for your fidelity to biblical doctrine,
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.200]   especially in the light of what it can cost
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.640]   to hold firm to those biblical convictions.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.480]   And thank you to everyone who's listening today.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.880]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   search our growing archive,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   or subscribe to the podcast all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.720]   Well, if God makes much of me, if he saves me,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.080]   because he's doing it all to make much of himself,
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.040]   doesn't that take the luster off of his love for me?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.280]   That's a really great question.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.360]   And one that comes up often based on some things
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.840]   that we've been addressing on the podcast.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.280]   We're gonna address that question next time.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.280]   Does God ruin his love for us by doing it for himself?
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.960]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday for that.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.000]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.160]   (upbeat music)
