[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.000]   Today's episode is about the biology, psychology,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720]   and practices of social bonding.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.700]   From the day we are born until the day we die,
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400]   the quality of our social bonds
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.240]   dictates much of our quality of life.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   It should therefore be no surprise that our brain,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.120]   and indeed much of our entire nervous system,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.780]   is wired for social bonds.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.360]   Now, social bonds occur between infant and parent.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.960]   There are even particular wiring diagrams within the brain
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.540]   and spinal cord and body that are oriented
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.520]   towards the specific bonds that occur
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.860]   between infant and mother, as well as infant and father.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180]   And we have specific brain circuitries for friendship,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.780]   specific brain circuitries that are activated
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.560]   in romantic relationships.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.580]   And as it goes, specific brain circuitries
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.940]   that are activated when we break up with a romantic partner,
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.380]   or when they break up with us,
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.200]   or when somebody passes away, moves away,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520]   or otherwise leaves our lives in one form or another.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.040]   Today, we are going to talk about
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.440]   those brain and nervous system circuitries.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.400]   We're also going to talk about the neurochemicals
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.240]   and hormones that underlie their function.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.880]   And we are going to touch on a number of important
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.560]   and actionable tools that you can apply in everyday life.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.120]   And because we are headed into the holiday,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.840]   the New Year's and Christmas holiday,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.300]   that you can deploy in your various interactions
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.040]   with family members and friends.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.020]   And should you not be spending time
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.120]   with family members and friends,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.900]   today we are also going to talk about
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.260]   how to achieve social bonds out of the context
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.300]   of family and romantic partnership and friendship.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.120]   So today's episode is going to include a lot of science,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.800]   a lot of actionable tools,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.760]   and I'm confident that you will come away
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.700]   from today's episode with tremendous knowledge
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.580]   about how you function.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.000]   For instance, if you're an introvert or an extrovert,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.840]   why is that?
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   Turns out there may be a neurochemical basis for that.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.320]   Maybe you're somebody that really enjoys social media.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.680]   Maybe you're somebody that doesn't.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.680]   Today I'm going to talk about a gene or a set of genes
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.560]   that predicts whether or not you will follow more people
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.640]   or seek out more online social interactions or fewer.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.720]   Believe it or not, there's biology around that now,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   and it's excellent peer reviewed work.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.960]   We will also talk about how bonds are broken
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.220]   and why breakups can be so painful,
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.500]   not just romantic breakups,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.160]   but breakups with friendships and coworkers
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.080]   and how to move through those more seamlessly.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.840]   So regardless of your age and regardless of whether or not
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   you are in a romantic partnership of one form or another
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.280]   or not, I do believe this episode will be useful to you
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.380]   as you explore the social bonds
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.800]   that already exist in your life
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   and as you seek out new and changing social bonds.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.560]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.120]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.040]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.180]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.120]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.360]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.860]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.520]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.440]   of the visual system,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.660]   and the visual system has many important features
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.740]   that allow us, for instance,
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.580]   to see things with crystal clarity,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.800]   even if it's brightly lit or dimly lit
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.060]   or they're changing brightness in our environment.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.860]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.440]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.480]   So when you wear them,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.520]   you don't have to take them off and put them back on
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.000]   like you would with other types of sunglasses and eyeglasses.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.640]   You're always going to see things with crystal clarity.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.280]   In addition, they're very lightweight,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.680]   so usually you forget that you're wearing them.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.080]   I certainly forget when I'm wearing mine.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920]   I wear readers at night and when I drive
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.480]   and I wear sunglasses often throughout the day.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.460]   The other thing that's really great
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.400]   about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.040]   is that you can wear them doing anything.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   You can wear them while running, while cycling.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.080]   If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.660]   But unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.800]   they have a terrific aesthetic
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.120]   that you could also wear to work, to school, out to dinner.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.580]   They're basically going to be worn anywhere, anytime.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.960]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.000]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.080]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.560]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout to get 20% off.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.280]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.040]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.360]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.500]   and I've taken it ever since.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.920]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.620]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.340]   and the reason that I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.860]   once or twice a day is because it covers
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.660]   all of my vitamin mineral probiotic foundational needs.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.980]   There's now a wealth of evidence pointing to the fact
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.260]   that vitamins, minerals, and probiotics support
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.880]   a healthy gut microbiome, healthy immune system,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.140]   healthy nervous system, healthy endocrine system,
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.340]   that's the hormone system.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.180]   And with Athletic Greens, it really covers all those bases.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.780]   In fact, when people ask me what one supplement
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.240]   they should take, I recommend Athletic Greens.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.540]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.140]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.840]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.540]   They're giving five free travel packs,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   which make it very easy to mix up the Athletic Greens
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.940]   while on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.300]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.100]   There's now a lot of evidence supporting that vitamin D3
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.000]   is great for our metabolism, endocrine system, mood, sleep,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.700]   a huge number of biological functions.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.060]   And K2 has also been shown to be important
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.320]   for cardiovascular health and various aspects
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.220]   of blood lipids.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.900]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.300]   you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.360]   You'll get your Athletic Greens,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.300]   five free travel packs of Athletic Greens,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.500]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.540]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.500]   supported by 25 published studies
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.040]   and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.020]   I've been meditating for a very long time,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.680]   more than three decades, but I confess,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.900]   I haven't been a consistent meditator until recently.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.860]   I think many people have that experience.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.980]   We've all heard about the terrific science
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.360]   and benefits of a regular meditation practice,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.020]   things like reduced anxiety, improved sleep,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.220]   sharper cognition and focus.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.500]   However, sticking to a meditation practice can be tricky
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.360]   and many people start and then they stop,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.460]   or at least that's what happened to me
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.520]   until a few years ago when I started using the Headspace app
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.140]   to do my meditation.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.020]   Headspace has short meditations
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.660]   of just a couple minutes long, longer meditations.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.680]   Ideally for me, I like to do a 20-minute meditation
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.860]   at least three times a week,
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.580]   but sometimes because of my schedule
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.700]   and other things going on,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.560]   I only sneak in a five-minute meditation
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.320]   once or twice a week.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   With Headspace, you have a huge number of meditations
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.340]   to select from.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.660]   So if you want to try Headspace,
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.460]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.620]   And if you do that, you'll get a completely free
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.840]   one-month trial with all of Headspace's meditations.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.620]   That's the full library of meditations
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.140]   that Headspace has to offer.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.420]   So again, if you're interested,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.520]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer today.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.860]   Let's talk about the biology of social bonding.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.780]   And I want to point out
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.840]   that I use the word bonding intentionally.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.220]   It's a verb.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.940]   And in biology, we want to think about verbs
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.280]   because everything in biology is a process.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.020]   It's not an event.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.500]   And when we think about things in biology as a process,
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.380]   that means it's going to have multiple steps.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.900]   And today we are going to explore the steps
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.380]   start to finish of social bonding,
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.700]   meaning how social bonds are established,
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.020]   how they are maintained, how they are broken,
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.380]   and how they are reestablished.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.860]   Now, an important feature of biology generally,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.780]   but in particular, as it relates to social bonding,
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.540]   is that the neural circuits,
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.580]   meaning the brain areas and neurons and the hormones,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.340]   things like oxytocin, which we'll talk about today,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.000]   and the other chemicals in the brain and body
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.260]   that are responsible for the process we call social bonding,
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.020]   are not unique to particular social bonds.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.380]   They are generic.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.980]   What I mean by that is that the same brain circuits
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.580]   that are responsible for establishing a bond
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.220]   between parent and child are actually repurposed
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.180]   in romantic relationships.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.620]   This might not come as a surprise to many of you.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   Many of you are probably familiar with this idea
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.880]   of securely attached people versus anxious attached people
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.660]   versus avoidant attached people.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.420]   We're going to touch on that a little bit,
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.460]   but all of that has roots in whether or not children
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.100]   and parents formed healthy social bonds
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.340]   or whether or not they had challenged social bonds.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.200]   Now, it's clear from the scientific
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.500]   and psychological literature
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.000]   that just because you might've had a not so great
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.100]   or even terrible social bond with a parent
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.240]   or with some other caretaker or loved one as a child,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.180]   that doesn't fate you to have poor social bonds as an adult.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.540]   There's a lot of plasticity in the system,
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.960]   meaning it can change,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.480]   it can rewire in response to experience.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.140]   And as we will soon discover,
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.260]   there are specific components within the neural circuits
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.340]   of your brain that are responsible for social bonding
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.520]   that allow you to place subjective labels
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.340]   on why you are doing certain things
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.020]   and to rewire the neural circuits for social bonding.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.900]   So we're going to touch on all of that today.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.540]   But the important feature really to point out
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.100]   is that we don't have 12 different circuits
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.820]   in the brain and body for different types of social bonds.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   We have one, and there's some universal features
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.660]   that underlie all forms of social bonds.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.260]   So we're going to start by exploring
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.020]   what those neural circuits are,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.100]   and then we are going to see how they plug
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.300]   into different types of social bonds.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.860]   And then we are going to explore things like introversion,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.560]   extraversion, where you're going to touch on a little bit
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.380]   about things like trauma bonds, healthy bonds,
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.020]   and various other aspects of how humans
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.600]   can bond to one another.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.280]   And as you'll soon discover,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.740]   there is a unique chemical signature
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.220]   of all bonding of all kinds.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.920]   And you're going to learn how to modulate
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.460]   that chemical signature.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.100]   Before we talk about social bonding,
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.180]   I want to talk about its mirror image,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.660]   which is lack of social bonding or social isolation.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.860]   Now, for better or for worse,
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.500]   there is a tremendous literature
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.340]   on the biology of social isolation
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.120]   and all of the terrible things that happen
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.140]   when animals or humans are socially isolated
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.900]   at particular phases of life.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.060]   Now, for those of you that are introverts,
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.080]   you are not necessarily damaging yourself
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.060]   by deciding to spend less time with other people.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.180]   Many people like time alone.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.060]   I personally am an introvert.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.300]   I get a thrill out of spending time
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.360]   with one or two close friends,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.540]   but I enjoy a lot of time by myself.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.580]   I like to socialize,
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.640]   so I wouldn't call myself an extreme introvert,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.860]   but I know there are some extreme introverts out there.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.700]   But when we talk about social isolation,
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.980]   what we're referring to is when animals or humans
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.980]   are restricted from having the social contacts
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.180]   that they would prefer to have.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.500]   And to just briefly touch on the major takeaways
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.920]   from this literature, which spans back 100 years or more,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.460]   being socially isolated is stressful.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.480]   And one of the hallmark features of social isolation
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.860]   is chronically elevated stress hormones like adrenaline,
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.900]   also called epinephrine, like cortisol,
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.660]   a stress hormone that at healthy levels
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.020]   is good for combating inflammation,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.960]   helps us have energy early in the day,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.300]   focused throughout the day.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.220]   But if cortisol is elevated for too long,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.140]   which is the consequence of social isolation,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.240]   the immune system suffers and other chemicals
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.340]   start to be released in the brain and body
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.780]   that are designed to motivate the organism,
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.500]   animal or human, to seek out social bonds.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.560]   An example of one such chemical
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.860]   is a peptide called tachykinin.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.700]   Tachykinin is present in flies, in mice and in humans,
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.460]   and under conditions of social isolation,
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.740]   its levels go up and because of the brain areas
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.380]   that contain receptors for tachykinin,
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.140]   people start feeling very aggressive and irritable
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.900]   after social isolation.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.020]   Now that should be a little bit counterintuitive to you.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.180]   You would think, oh, if you isolate an animal or human
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.820]   and then you give them the opportunity
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.280]   for social interaction, they should behave very well,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.120]   they should be thrilled,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.960]   they're finally getting the nourishment,
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.780]   the social nourishment that they've been lacking for so long.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.200]   It turns out that's not the case.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.980]   Chronic social isolation changes
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.620]   the nature of the brain and body
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.740]   such that it makes social connection harder
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.000]   and it makes the person who's been isolated irritable,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.540]   even aggressive with other people.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.900]   Now, I don't want to go too deeply
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.580]   into the biology of social isolation
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.940]   because it doesn't actually afford us that much insight
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.500]   into what healthy social bonding looks like.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.300]   So today we're going to focus more
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.820]   on the functional biology,
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.220]   dual meaning of the word functional,
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.920]   as opposed to the pathology of social isolation.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.060]   However, I do want to point out
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.720]   that social isolation starts to deteriorate
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.420]   certain aspects of brain and body pretty quickly,
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.580]   but how quickly depends, again,
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.980]   on how introverted or extroverted somebody is.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.020]   So if you're somebody who's socially isolated
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.940]   for the holidays or has been socially isolated
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.960]   for a period of time and is craving social contact,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.440]   that is a healthy craving.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.340]   And as we'll learn next,
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.380]   the healthy craving for social contact
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.140]   has a very specific brain circuit,
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.120]   has a very specific neurochemical signature
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.400]   associated with it, and has some remarkable features
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.960]   that you can leverage in social contacts of all kinds.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.620]   I think some of the more important
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.700]   and exciting work on social bonding
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.040]   comes from the laboratory of Kay Tai.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.880]   Kay is a professor at the Salk Institute
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.220]   for Biological Studies.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.900]   She's an investigator with the Howard Hughes
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.220]   Medical Institute.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.700]   And in recent years,
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.860]   I would say in about the last five or six years,
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.240]   her laboratory has made a fundamental discovery
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.700]   as to why we seek out and put so much effort
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.420]   into social bonds.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.160]   And the key discovery that she made is that much like hunger,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.520]   much like temperature, much like thirst,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.140]   we have brain circuits that are devoted
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.880]   to what's called a social homeostasis.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.340]   Many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.300]   Homeostasis is the characteristic
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.260]   of various biological circuits and even individual cells
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.480]   to try and maintain a certain level.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.860]   It's most easily thought of in the context of hunger.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.820]   If you don't eat for a while,
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.500]   your drive to pursue food and think about food
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.180]   and make food and spend money on food,
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.180]   and indeed to enjoy food goes up.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.780]   Whereas when you're well-fed,
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.040]   you don't tend to seek out food with as much vigor
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.060]   or as much intensity.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.900]   You wouldn't invest as much time, effort, money, et cetera.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.260]   So homeostasis is the aspect of cells, tissues,
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.980]   and organisms to seek some sort of balance,
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.240]   to regulate themselves.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.260]   In a crude way, you can think about the thermostat
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.700]   on your home as a homeostatic circuit.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.220]   When the temperature goes up a little bit,
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.660]   it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.420]   When the room gets cold, it hits a certain level
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.920]   and a sensor detects that, it clicks on,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.820]   and then the heat goes on
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.860]   to maintain a certain set temperature.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.880]   So that's a simple way of thinking about homeostasis.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.100]   Every homeostatic circuit has three components,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.240]   or at least three.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.960]   One is a detector, meaning the organism
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.300]   or the thermostat on your wall has to have some way
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.820]   of detecting what's going on in the environment, all right,
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.120]   in the context of social bonding,
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.040]   whether or not you are interacting with others
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.860]   and whether or not those interactions are going well.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.200]   So that has to be detected, that's the first thing.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.740]   Then there has to be a control center,
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.280]   that's the second thing.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.920]   And the control center is the one that makes the adjustments
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   to, in the case of social bonding,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.320]   to your behavior and to your psychology.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.220]   So you'll soon learn that there are ways in which
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.140]   the more time that you spend alone,
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.940]   the more motivated you are to seek out the pictures of faces,
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.100]   the interactions with actual people,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.320]   physical contact, and so forth.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.960]   Now that might seem obvious to you,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.740]   but thanks to the work of Keitai and others,
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.840]   it's remarkable to learn that there are specific
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.900]   brain centers that are adjusting our psychology and biology
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.560]   so that we seek out bonds more aggressively,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.300]   or maybe we don't because we are perfectly sated
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.320]   or satiated with respect to how much contact
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.720]   we've had with other people.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.820]   Now, the third component of this homeostatic circuit
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.160]   is the effector.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.280]   The effector is actually what drives
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.200]   the behavioral response.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's what leads you to pick up your social media
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.460]   and start scrolling.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.020]   It's what leads you to text a friend.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.040]   It's what leads you to call a friend or make plans
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.640]   and what leads you to follow through on those plans.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.520]   So again, those three components are a detector,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   a control center, and an effector.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.000]   And as you'll soon learn,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.600]   the neural circuit that controls this social homeostasis
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.240]   actually has a fourth component.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.280]   And that fourth component is one
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.520]   that places subjective understanding
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.840]   as to why you are doing what you are doing
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   and establishes your place in a hierarchy.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.280]   Now, I know the word hierarchy can be a little bit
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.520]   of a barbed wire one because people immediately
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.960]   start thinking about boss and subordinate
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.600]   or in couples, a leader and a follower.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.960]   But when we talk about social hierarchies
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.780]   in the context of human interactions,
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.920]   social hierarchies are very plastic,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.060]   meaning in one setting, one person can be the leader.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.420]   In another setting, the other person can be the leader.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.720]   You probably have groups of friends or family members
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.940]   where you're constantly passing the baton
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.800]   as to who's going to drive, who's going to navigate,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.420]   who's going to pick the restaurant,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.140]   who's going to clear the dishes,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.640]   and who's going to do certain activities and not others.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.880]   So hierarchies are very dynamic.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.080]   And as a consequence, social bonding has to be very plastic
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.660]   and very fluid so that you move from one environment
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.880]   to the next, even with the same people,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.120]   you have to be able to make those adjustments.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.020]   And in the case of the social homeostasis circuit,
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.020]   those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.540]   I've talked about in this podcast before,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.140]   it's called the prefrontal cortex.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.980]   It is the seat of our higher consciousness, if you will.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.020]   It's what allows us to play subjective labels on things
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.800]   so we are not strictly input-output, we're not robotic.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.420]   Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.020]   and they are exceptional at choosing restaurants,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.880]   well, in the context of the social homeostasis circuit,
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.500]   your prefrontal cortex would allow them
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.600]   to pick the restaurant because basically,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.180]   they are dominant over you in their capacity
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.020]   to pick good restaurants, at least in this example.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.140]   Whereas as you leave that restaurant
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.380]   and perhaps you are navigating
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.820]   to where to get a drink after dinner
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.580]   or where to walk through the city,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.540]   perhaps you have the better sense of direction.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.060]   And so then the social bonding has to be maintained
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.380]   as you switch the hierarchy, okay?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.220]   So that's the role of that fourth element,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.580]   the prefrontal cortex.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.220]   Now, I just briefly want to touch on some of the brain areas
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.780]   that thanks to the work of Keitai and others,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.620]   we now know underlie the detection, control, and response.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.620]   Okay, I call them the detector, control center, and effector
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.400]   because inside of that description
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.140]   isn't just a bunch of names of neural structures.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.280]   There are also hints
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.900]   as to what the underlying neurochemicals are.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.440]   And by understanding what the neurochemicals are,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.740]   you can start to think about tools that you can use
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.580]   to form social bonds
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.620]   and maintain social bonds in better, healthier ways.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.760]   So let's talk about the detector first.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.740]   Now, keep in mind that you have your senses.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.540]   You have your vision, you have your hearing,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.340]   you have touch, you have smell, you have taste.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.000]   Sensation, as I've talked about many times before
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.860]   in the podcast, but I'll just remind you,
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.520]   sensation is the conversion of physical stimuli
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.480]   in the environment into electrical and chemical signals
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.580]   in your nervous system.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.700]   The language of the nervous system
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.500]   is electrical and chemical signals.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.660]   So photons of light
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.520]   are converted to electrical and chemical signals.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.080]   Pressure on the skin or light touch on the skin
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.120]   is converted into electrical and chemical signals
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.440]   and so on and so forth.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.500]   So all of that, of course, is flowing into the nervous system
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.640]   but the detector that underlies social homeostasis
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.940]   involves mainly two structures.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.380]   One is called the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex,
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.140]   and the other is the BLA, basolateral amygdala.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.260]   And when you hear the word amygdala,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.900]   you're probably thinking fear.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.420]   But today, as you'll see,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.460]   the amygdala actually has
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.940]   many different subcompartments and components.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.620]   And there's a reason why the basolateral amygdala,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.160]   which is associated with certain aspects
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.540]   of aversive behaviors,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.900]   meaning moving away from certain types of things
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.860]   or interactions,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.340]   there's a reason why the BLA
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.660]   is such an integral part of the detector system.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.060]   And that's because just as it's important to form
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.180]   healthy social bonds,
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.700]   it's vitally important to try and avoid
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.500]   unhealthy social bonds.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.020]   And so the basolateral amygdala
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.180]   is mainly associated with these aversive type responses
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.580]   of just moving away from certain things.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.220]   The control center in the social homeostasis circuit
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.880]   involves a brain area called the lateral hypothalamus
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.140]   and the periventricular hypothalamus.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.580]   The lateral hypothalamus and the periventricular hypothalamus
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.580]   contain neurons that are able to access the hormone system
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.540]   in order to influence the release of things like oxytocin,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.680]   which is a hormone neuropeptide.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.000]   It's kind of part hormone, part neurotransmitter.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.860]   It's kind of a hybrid.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.380]   We're going to talk a lot about oxytocin today.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.600]   So we've got the ACC and the BLA.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.100]   These are areas that are mainly involved
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.480]   in moving away from things,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.820]   although also toward them.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.660]   That's the detector.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.180]   Then we've got the control center,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.060]   which is in the hypothalamus.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.260]   And then there's a very special and important area
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.740]   associated with social bonding
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.420]   that I want everyone to learn,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.820]   which is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN,
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.980]   dorsal raphe nucleus.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.760]   The dorsal raphe nucleus is a small collection of neurons
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.820]   in the midbrain, so it's deep in the brain.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.900]   And most of the time when you hear about raphe,
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.700]   R-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus,
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.340]   you're talking about serotonin.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.820]   Serotonin is a neuromodulator
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.180]   that is often associated with feelings of satiety
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.840]   after eating, warmth, basically satisfaction
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.820]   with things that you already have.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.740]   However, within this dorsal raphe nucleus,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.700]   there is a small subset of neurons that release dopamine.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.120]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.980]   with movement, craving, motivation, and desire.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.340]   And the neural circuits that are rich with dopamine
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.040]   are things like the substantia nigra,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.840]   the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.140]   the nucleus accumbens, et cetera,
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.040]   those names don't have to mean anything to you.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.800]   However, this unique population of dopamine neurons
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.580]   in the raphe is truly unique in that it's responsible
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.180]   for mediating what I've been calling social homeostasis.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.780]   It is the effector or the response
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.820]   that mediates social homeostasis.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.920]   Now, I haven't told you exactly what social homeostasis is.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.780]   Social homeostasis, just like hunger,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.420]   is the process by which when you lack social interaction,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.700]   you start to crave it.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.420]   What's very interesting about the fact
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.660]   that there are dopamine neurons in this raphe structure
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.380]   that is the effector for social homeostasis
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.380]   is that what this means is that when you are not interacting
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.660]   with people at a frequency or intensity
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.660]   that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.300]   In most popular conversations about dopamine,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.020]   and even in scientific circles,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.400]   when you hear dopamine release,
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.620]   you think about reward or feeling good
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.180]   because indeed many behaviors
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.180]   and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.000]   That's one of the reasons
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.220]   they have so much addictive potential.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.380]   However, dopamine is not associated with feeling good.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.440]   It is actually the neurochemical that's responsible
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.960]   for movement toward things that feel good.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.820]   So to zoom out and conceptualize what we have here,
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.420]   we have a brain area that is a detector
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.340]   that either will move us toward or away
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.860]   from certain types of experiences or sensations.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.500]   We have a control center that is going to release
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.700]   certain hormones and neuropeptides into our brain and blood,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.380]   depending on the sorts of interactions
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.220]   that we happen to be having.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.500]   And we have this response system,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.460]   which is the dorsal raphe nucleus
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.940]   that contains dopamine neurons.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.220]   And when we are not interacting with people
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.100]   at the frequency or intensity that we crave,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.240]   dopamine is released and that dopamine causes us
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.840]   to seek out social interactions of particular kinds.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.480]   So let's talk about what social homeostasis is
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.740]   and how it plays out.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.380]   And again, let's use hunger as an example.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.020]   So let's say you're a person
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.140]   who eats every three or four hours regularly.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.900]   So on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.880]   you're just accustomed to eating every three or four hours.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.800]   If just suddenly I steal your meal out of the fridge at work,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.780]   something I would not do,
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.540]   but just for sake of mental experimentation,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.840]   that would probably cause you to go and seek out food
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.740]   through some other route.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   You might buy food, you'd probably be upset first,
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.480]   but then you go buy food or replace the food
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.320]   that you were going to eat.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   You'd be hungry for that food.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.280]   And indeed there are hormonal type mechanisms
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.320]   and other mechanisms that when we eat regularly
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.040]   and we predict that food is coming in,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.540]   we actually start secreting insulin,
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.460]   which is for mobilizing blood sugar.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.260]   There are hormones in the bloodstream
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.500]   that make us hungry on a regular clock-like schedule.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.200]   And you would seek out more food.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.940]   Similarly, if you're somebody who is accustomed
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.860]   to a lot of social interaction,
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.520]   and suddenly I take away that social interaction,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.420]   you would feel kind of let down.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.020]   You would crave a replacement social interaction.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.420]   You might be upset that you had a lunch date with a friend,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.500]   you're used to having lunch with them every Wednesday,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.280]   and they cancel and you would crave the interaction, okay?
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.500]   This is called a prosocial craving.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.540]   And indeed, this is what you see in animals and humans.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.340]   If you, what's called acutely isolate them,
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.220]   which is just a fancy scientific word of saying,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.900]   deprive them of social interactions in a short-term basis,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.260]   they start engaging in prosocial behaviors.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.400]   They start texting other people,
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.020]   they start seeking out social interactions
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.460]   of different kinds.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.460]   And that makes perfect sense, right?
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.940]   But thought of from a different side,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.780]   you could also imagine how,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.380]   well, if you're getting a social interaction
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.180]   with somebody on a daily or weekly basis,
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.740]   and suddenly you remove that interaction,
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.820]   well, then people might not care.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.660]   They might just think,
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.660]   well, I'll get the interaction tomorrow
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.620]   or the next year or the next day,
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.860]   because they're sated,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.180]   much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.740]   might say, well, I ate four hours ago
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.280]   and I'll eat eight hours later, no big deal.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.860]   But that's not what happens.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.400]   There's a prediction that we are going to have
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.900]   certain types of interactions.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.460]   And when those interactions don't happen,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.540]   we replace that lack of interaction
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.260]   with a drive and a motivation
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.620]   to seek out social interaction.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.020]   And that drive and motivation is caused by,
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.700]   or I should say is driven by dopamine release
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.540]   from that dorsal raphe.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.340]   And so the takeaway is that
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.220]   when we lack social interaction that we expect,
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.060]   we become prosocial.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.400]   However, if we are chronically socially isolated,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.180]   meaning we don't have interactions
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.880]   with people for a long time,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.500]   we become actually more introverted.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.900]   This is separate from all of the tacky kind and stuff
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.980]   that I talked about earlier
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.020]   or falling into states of chronic stress,
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.280]   but it's well-established now that in humans and in animals,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.860]   if you don't give them enough social interaction,
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.060]   they actually become antisocial.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.940]   And so this is actually a little bit like
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.060]   what one might see with long-term fasting.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.820]   I give the example of eating every four hours.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.340]   Now let's give the parallel example
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.580]   of somebody who's been fasting perhaps
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.140]   for two or three days.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.900]   If they are expecting to eat
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.460]   and then the meal doesn't arrive,
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.700]   they are not necessarily going to immediately try
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.900]   and seek out food.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.180]   And that's a little bit counterintuitive.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.000]   You would have thought,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.180]   well, they haven't eaten in a very long time.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.460]   They're going to be very motivated to seek out food,
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.960]   but no, they are accustomed to fasting.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.940]   Similarly, the social homeostasis circuit
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.620]   works in a way such that
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.820]   when we don't have social interactions for a very long time,
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.720]   we start to lose our craving for social interactions.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   Let's look at the social homeostasis circuit
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.660]   through the lens of what's commonly called
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.420]   introversion and extroversion.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.300]   Now, typically when we hear about introverts,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.300]   we think about the quiet person at the party
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.140]   or the person that doesn't want to go out at all.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.480]   And we think about an extrovert
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.900]   as somebody who's really social,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.540]   the so-called social butterfly,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.260]   who enjoys social interactions, is really chatty,
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.000]   is kind of life of the party type person.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.940]   That's the cliche or the kind of pop psychology cliche.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.920]   But actually in the psychology literature,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.860]   that's not really the way it holds up.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.360]   Many people who appear introverted are actually extroverted.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.880]   The quiet person at a party could be an extrovert,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.420]   except that they just don't talk very much.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.240]   The characteristic of an extrovert
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.940]   is somebody that gets energy or feels good
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.100]   from social interactions.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.380]   They sort of get a lift.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.020]   And we can predict that that lift occurs
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.060]   because of some release of dopamine
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.140]   within their brain and body.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.460]   And indeed there's evidence for that.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.520]   Neuroimaging studies support that.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.580]   Other forms of neurobiological analysis
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.100]   support that as well.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.300]   We can also imagine that the person who's talking a lot
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.500]   is somebody who's very extroverted.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.420]   But oftentimes people who talk a lot for their work
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.500]   or they're somebody who's very social
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.100]   when you interact with them,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.620]   that person gets back to their car
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.580]   and is absolutely depleted and exhausted by that interaction
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.400]   or all sorts of social interactions.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.720]   So we really can't predict whether or not
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.620]   somebody is an introvert or an extrovert
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.060]   simply based on their behavior.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.120]   It's really more of an internal subjective label.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.540]   However, if we look at introversion and extroversion
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.940]   through this lens of the social homeostatic set point,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.700]   and we think about dopamine as this molecule
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.360]   that drives motivation to seek out social interactions,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.660]   what we can reasonably assume is that introverts are people
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.080]   that when they engage in certain forms
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.840]   of social interaction,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   either the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.980]   is greater than it is in an extrovert.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.400]   That's right, I said greater than it is in an extrovert.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.000]   And so they actually feel quite motivated,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.920]   but also satisfied by very brief,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.260]   or we could say sort of sparse social interactions.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.520]   They don't need a lot of social engagement to feel sated.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.740]   Again, the parallel example will be hunger.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.000]   This would be somebody who doesn't need to eat much
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.900]   in order to feel satisfied.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.540]   Whereas the extrovert, we can reasonably assume,
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.140]   releases less dopamine in response
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.100]   to an individual social interaction.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.300]   And so they need much more social interaction
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.500]   in order to feel filled up by that interaction.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.580]   And indeed, this is supported
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.820]   by the neurobiological imaging studies.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.220]   So rather than think about introverts and extroverts
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.780]   as chatty versus quiet,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.220]   it's useful to think about people, maybe yourself,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.820]   maybe other people you know,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.340]   as how much social interaction they need
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.660]   in order to bring the social homeostasis into balance.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.020]   Now there's the fourth component
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.420]   of this social homeostasis circuit that I mentioned before,
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.180]   and that's the prefrontal cortex.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.240]   The prefrontal cortex is involved in thinking
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.620]   and planning and action,
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.580]   and it has extensive connections with areas of the brain,
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.260]   like the hypothalamus,
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.660]   which is responsible for a lot of motivated drives.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.020]   It also has connections
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.740]   with the various reward centers of the brain,
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.480]   and it can act as kind of an accelerator,
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.500]   meaning it can encourage more electrical activity
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.020]   of other brain centers,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.320]   or as a brake on those brain centers.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.500]   Really good example.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.900]   It's kind of a trivial one
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.360]   in the context of today's discussion,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.160]   but it's a concrete one, so I'll use it.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.680]   Would be, I know many people out there use cold showers
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.200]   as a way to stimulate metabolism
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.180]   and build up resilience and this sort of thing.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.120]   If you get into a very cold shower
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.740]   and you feel as if you want to get out,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.440]   but you force yourself to stay in,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.560]   you're forcing yourself to stay in
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.880]   because your prefrontal cortex
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.660]   is placing some subjective label on that experience.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   Either you're doing it for a certain benefit,
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.600]   or you've got a timer and you're using the timer
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.700]   as the regulator of how long you're going to stay in.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.520]   Basically, you're overriding reflexes,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.720]   and that's the main function of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.620]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.580]   the prefrontal cortex components
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.180]   that wire into the social homeostasis circuit
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.120]   are responsible for evaluating
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.400]   where you are in a given hierarchy.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.180]   And that affords you a ton of flexibility
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.980]   in terms of the types of social interactions
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.900]   that you can engage in,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.380]   and whether or not you're going to spend time
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.080]   with certain people or not,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.000]   whether or not you're going to engage and then disengage.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.900]   What do I mean by this?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.200]   Well, let's say you're an extroverted person.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.480]   You're somebody that likes a lot of social interaction
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.960]   and you get a lot of dopamine release on whole
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.440]   from a lot of social interaction.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.320]   So maybe one interaction with a teller at the supermarket
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.240]   isn't really going to give you much dopamine,
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.660]   but going to a party will give you more dopamine,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.980]   and so you seek out these larger social interactions.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.880]   However, you might go to a party
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.960]   where somebody says something or you see somebody there
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.640]   that you'd much prefer not to see,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.440]   and therefore you decide to leave.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.400]   The deciding to leave is regulated
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.560]   by that prefrontal cortex component.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.340]   So it's important to understand
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.320]   that just because there's a homeostatic circuit
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.960]   that involves areas like the amygdala and the hypothalamus
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.680]   and these deep brain regions like the dorsal raphe,
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.380]   as a human being, you have flexibility
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.660]   over your social interactions,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.560]   and that flexibility arrives from those prefrontal circuits.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.120]   So there's a ton of subjective nature to it.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.880]   There's a lot of context to it.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   So while there are some predictable elements
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.580]   of these circuits,
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.200]   they are not simply what we would call plug and chug.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.380]   You have flexibility.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.320]   You are able to say, you know, I love parties,
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.960]   but I really don't want to go to that party
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.200]   because so-and-so is there,
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.080]   or I very much don't like going across town in traffic,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.280]   but I'm going to do it today
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.600]   because a certain collection of people,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.820]   or perhaps a certain individual,
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.400]   will be at that particular party.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.040]   And so the prefrontal cortex, again,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.600]   is what allows you that subjective ruling
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.840]   or ruling over what would otherwise just be reflexes.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.040]   So now I'd like to drill a little bit deeper
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.680]   into this incredible neural structure
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.800]   that is the dorsal raphe nucleus
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.140]   and this small collection of neurons,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.960]   the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.300]   because while it's a small collection,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.700]   they are very powerful.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.780]   Loneliness has been defined by the great psychologist,
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.080]   John Cacioppo, as the distress that results
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.840]   from discrepancies between ideal
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.560]   and perceived social relationships.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.400]   Let me repeat that.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.880]   Loneliness is not just being isolated.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.720]   Loneliness, as he defines it,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.320]   is the distress that results from discrepancies
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.040]   between ideal and perceived social relationships.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.000]   It's when we expect things to be one way
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.560]   and they're actually another way.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.000]   And which way we expect them to be
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   and which way they turn out, again, is highly subjective.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.920]   What you expect from friendships
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.420]   and what other people expect from friendships
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.800]   could be entirely different,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.240]   but the circuit that underlies friendship bonding
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.640]   is exactly the same.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.000]   And it is this dorsal raphe nucleus
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.720]   and the dopamine neurons in that nucleus
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.080]   that underlie the bond that is social friendship
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.020]   and all types of social bonds.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.360]   There's a key finding in the literature.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.960]   The title of this paper is "Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   "Represent the Experience of Social Isolation."
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.660]   This is a paper from Kay Tye's lab.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.040]   The first author is Mathews, Jillian Mathews,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.540]   to be specific.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.400]   What they did is they were able to selectively activate
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.520]   the dopamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.380]   And when they did that, they induced a loneliness-like state.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.840]   Now, how did they know it was a loneliness-like state?
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.320]   They knew because it motivated the seeking out
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.600]   of social connections.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.680]   This is the kind of social hunger
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.560]   that I was referring to before.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.520]   Whereas when the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.720]   are inhibited, meaning their activity is quieted,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.860]   that suppressed a loneliness state.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.920]   So that's a little counterintuitive, right?
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.680]   It's a group of neurons that when activated
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.280]   makes you feel lonely.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.060]   And when this brain area is not activated,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.620]   it suppresses loneliness.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.460]   But if you think about it,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.200]   that's exactly the kind of circuit that you would want
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.740]   in order to drive social behavior.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.640]   When you're feeling lonely, dopamine is released
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.620]   and it causes you to go out and seek social interactions.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.600]   When this brain area has enough social interactions,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.780]   that's sort of a figure of speech,
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.960]   brain areas don't have enough social interactions.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.460]   But when enough social interactions have happened,
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.720]   that the neurons in this brain area
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   shut down their production of dopamine,
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.100]   well, the loneliness state turns off.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.120]   So what we think of as loneliness,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.680]   as this big kind of dark cloud
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.240]   or fog in our psychological landscape,
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.440]   boils down to a very small set of neurons
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.520]   releasing a specific neurochemical for motivation.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.360]   And to me, this really changes the way
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.820]   that we think about loneliness
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.760]   and that we think about social interactions.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.720]   There's so much subjective landscape
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.880]   to loneliness and to social interactions.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.840]   But at the end of the day,
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.640]   what it really is is that we are all social animals
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.200]   to some extent or another,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.520]   and we all crave social interactions
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.860]   to some extent or another,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.440]   although the extent will vary depending on where you are
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.820]   in the introversion/extroversion continuum,
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.540]   and it is indeed a continuum.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.380]   Now, the other aspect of the study that was really important
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.000]   gets back to that issue of hierarchy and social rank.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.400]   What they found is that depending on where you see yourself
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.260]   in the social rank,
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.240]   the dopamine neurons in the raphe
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.880]   will lead to one consequence or another,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.380]   meaning moving toward social interactions
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.120]   or moving away from them.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.060]   So the whole system is set up
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.840]   so that you have a ton of flexibility
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   and control over social interactions.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.480]   So just a couple of key points and actionable takeaways
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.040]   based on the information I've offered up until now.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.140]   If you think of yourself as an introvert,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.460]   it's very likely that you get a lot of dopamine
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.160]   from a few or minimal social interactions.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.920]   Whereas if you're an extrovert,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.980]   contrary to what you might think,
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.220]   social interactions are not going to flood your system
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.200]   with dopamine.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.160]   They actually are going to lead to less dopamine release
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.780]   than it would for an introvert,
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.000]   and therefore you're going to need
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.020]   a lot more social interactions
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.960]   in order to feel filled up by those interactions.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.500]   Now I've been drawing a lot of parallels
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.820]   between this social seeking
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.380]   or avoiding social isolation and hunger,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.220]   but is that really the case?
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.440]   And could it be that there are actually interactions
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.760]   between the different drives,
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.480]   meaning could social isolation
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.240]   or the desire to seek out social interactions
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.260]   actually relate to the hunger system and vice versa?
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.580]   And indeed the answer is yes.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.680]   We don't have 50 different homeostatic systems
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.740]   and 50 different neurochemicals
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.780]   to underlie our drive to eat,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.860]   our drive for romantic interactions,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.080]   our drive for friendship interactions.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.100]   We have essentially one, maybe two,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.980]   and they all funnel into the same dopamine system.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.500]   And there's a beautiful paper
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.180]   that illustrates some of the crossover
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.540]   between these different homeostatic drives.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.480]   The title of the paper is "Acute Social Isolation Evokes
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.620]   Midbrain Craving Responses Similar to Hunger."
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.460]   This is from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT,
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.980]   Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.340]   Dr. Kay Tai is also an author on this paper.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.940]   The paper was published in "Nature Neuroscience."
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.340]   It's a really terrific paper.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.660]   Just to briefly summarize what they did,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.900]   they took people that were categorized
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.140]   as socially connected, healthy human adults.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.220]   So these are people that are used
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.520]   to pretty frequent social interactions,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.380]   and they socially isolated them for about 10 hours.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.040]   And they had no opportunity to access social media,
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.160]   email, fiction reading even,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.740]   and certainly didn't have the opportunity
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.800]   to interact with people face-to-face.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.660]   So what this did is it increased social craving,
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.520]   both objectively, the people said
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.600]   that they were now craving social interactions,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.020]   and then they did brain imaging
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.100]   in response to images of people,
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.060]   people interacting, food, flowers, other types of stimuli.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.360]   Some of the stimuli or these images,
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.040]   we call them stimuli, but they're images really,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.980]   had a lot of social engagement going on in them.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.820]   Others did not.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.420]   Some had a lot of faces showing, others did not.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.140]   And as you might suspect,
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.520]   there was activation of many of the brain areas
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.920]   that we've talked about earlier, dorsal raphe nucleus,
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.400]   and other brain areas associated with dopaminergic neurons.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   When the socially isolated people viewed social cues,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.700]   people interacting, faces, and so on,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.080]   and less so for things like flowers.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.880]   However, they also had increased responses
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.380]   to images of food, which is interesting,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.820]   and actually is consistent with the literature
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.680]   that when people are socially isolated,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.140]   they often will start eating more,
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.940]   or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.300]   Now, we think of that as comfort foods
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.900]   or soothing oneself through eating
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.840]   But while it might not be healthy,
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.060]   depending on the context and the person,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.420]   it's really important to understand
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.640]   that the reason that happens
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.780]   is because we have a common circuit
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.880]   and that the system, meaning the person,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.860]   is actually craving dopamine release.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.120]   They don't consciously know this.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.740]   This is all subconsciously carried out,
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.420]   but they're craving dopamine release.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.460]   And if they can't get it from social interactions
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.500]   as they normally would, they'll start seeking it from food.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.900]   Now, they did an important reverse experiment as well
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.640]   where they had subjects go on 10 hours of food fasting.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.520]   Now, these were not people that were familiar with fasting.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.240]   They weren't doing intermittent fasting.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.820]   They were eating more typical meal schedules.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.700]   And so that created increased hunger, et cetera,
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.060]   but it also increased their appetite, if you will,
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.740]   for social interactions.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.340]   And so the important point here
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.340]   is that there's a common biology,
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.820]   there's a common circuitry
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.900]   that underlies homeostatic craving of things
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.060]   that maintain us as individuals and as a species.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.240]   And it really places social interactions
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.820]   as right up there in the list of things
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.540]   that we could consider so vital for our survival
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.380]   and for our health.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.580]   Things like food, water, social interactions
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:07.100]   are really sit within a top tier amongst each other,
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.180]   and they use the same common circuitry,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.100]   dorsal raphe dopamine neurons,
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.400]   in addition to other structures
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.800]   in order to create this drive
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.180]   to seek out certain types of stimuli.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.920]   Now, this is a very reductionist view of social bonding.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.360]   I realize that.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.060]   But it's important to realize
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.560]   that while we place all this subjective context,
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.820]   oh, I miss this person,
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.380]   or I really would like to avoid that person,
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.220]   at the end of the day,
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.820]   it really all funnels into a system
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.680]   whereby a single neurochemical
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.580]   is either being released and motivating us
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.220]   to seek out more of a particular type of interaction
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.120]   or is not released,
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.560]   and therefore we are perfectly comfortable
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.660]   staying exactly where we are.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.900]   As I say this, some of you are probably thinking,
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.220]   oh, that's probably what happens when you fall in love.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.680]   And indeed, that's the case.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.300]   When people enter romantic relationships,
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.320]   that to them are very satisfying.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.700]   There's this period that,
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.320]   the theory is that it lasts anywhere
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.160]   from six days to six months,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.120]   although some people report
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.260]   that this feeling can last many, many years, even decades,
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.160]   of just feeling completely filled up and sated
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.740]   by the experience of being with that person,
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.900]   so much so that cravings for food are reduced,
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.520]   cravings for sleep are reduced.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.740]   Now, there's all sorts of activities
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.140]   and things that go along with new romantic partnerships
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.340]   that take up time
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.300]   that might get in the way of things like sleep
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.600]   or things like food.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.820]   But the point is that dopamine is the final common pathway
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.700]   by which we seek out things
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.380]   and we end up feeling as if we are satisfied
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.500]   by certain types of interactions.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.620]   Now, similarly, if you've ever been isolated
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.380]   for a long period of time,
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.620]   your focus might've shifted to what you're going to eat,
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.720]   what you're going to cook for dinner
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.500]   in a much more heightened way.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.780]   The importance of those sensory stimuli
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.100]   and those types of interactions,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.820]   and indeed the taste of food itself, expands.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.700]   So normally, when we are in social relationships
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.120]   that are ones that are familiar to us,
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.260]   we have a balance of these different drives.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.300]   But when one particular drive takes over
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.820]   and we are very focused on it,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.480]   because they all funnel into the same circuitry,
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.440]   there really isn't the seeking out
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.280]   of certain types of behaviors like food seeking
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.900]   when we're newly in love.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.140]   Now, that doesn't mean that food won't taste good to us
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.980]   so that we don't seek it.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.760]   And indeed, there are experiments that have been done
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.280]   where if people have just fallen in love,
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.960]   the taste of a strawberry can just be incredible.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.220]   The other effect of dopamine is that it changes the way
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.860]   that we interpret sensory stimuli.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.980]   Our detectors actually change when we are in heightened
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.340]   states of dopaminergic activity or drive.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.680]   Basically what this means is that things seem better
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.900]   than they would when we have less dopamine in our system.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.460]   The point here is that there's a lot of crossover.
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.460]   There's a lot of meshing together
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.180]   of different homeostatic drives,
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.540]   that they don't exist in separate channels.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.380]   And it's only under conditions
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.940]   in which one particular homeostatic drive
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.820]   is kind of being played out to the extreme,
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.180]   such as the example of falling in love,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.900]   that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.300]   the other homeostatic drives.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.020]   And that's because simply we're getting enough dopamine
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.600]   we don't need anymore.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.740]   Up until now, I've been focused on the organizational logic
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.860]   of social bonding, which is really just nerd speak
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.500]   for how is it that we form bonds, avoid bonds?
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.660]   Why do people seek out more or fewer bonds
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.260]   than others, et cetera?
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.600]   Now I'd like to shift gears a bit
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.060]   and focus on what are some things that we can do
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.600]   to encourage the formation of healthy bonds.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.260]   There's a beautiful study that was published
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.420]   in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.440]   The title of this paper is conscious processing
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.420]   of narrative stimuli synchronizes heart rate
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.040]   between individuals.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.740]   I mentioned this on a previous podcast,
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.180]   but I'd like to mention it again
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.340]   and go into a little bit more depth
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.960]   because it points to specific actionable items
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.000]   that we can all use in order to enhance the quality
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.240]   and depth of social bonds of all kinds.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.740]   Now, this study involved a very simple type of experiment.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.440]   They had people listen to a story.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.100]   Everybody in the study listened to the same story,
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.880]   but they listened to that story at different times
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.800]   and indeed in different locations.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.860]   So different people, same story.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.840]   And they measured things like heart rate.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.600]   They measured breathing, et cetera.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.780]   Now, what was the motivation for doing this?
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.420]   Well, there's a long standing literature showing
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.180]   that our physiology, things like our heart rate,
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.000]   our breathing, our skin conductance,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.180]   meaning the amount of sweating can be synchronized
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.820]   between individuals.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.860]   And that synchronization can occur
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.540]   according to a variety of different things.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.500]   There've been studies that have people look at one another
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.540]   and they look and actually see that their pupil size
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.780]   of their eyes starts to synchronize.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.940]   People's breathing can synchronize.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.500]   People's body temperatures can even start to synchronize
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.620]   or at least shifts in body temperature can synchronize.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.820]   One person gets cooler, the other person gets cooler.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.540]   A lot of this is subconscious.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.600]   Some of it can be detected by conscious cues
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.660]   like flushing of the skin
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.720]   or actually seeing someone's pupils change.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.700]   But actually the pupil reflex is a really good example
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.780]   whereby except for rare cases
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.580]   and certain highly trained individuals,
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.940]   most people can't control their pupil reflexes
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.300]   in a very deliberate way.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.920]   It's truly a reflex.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   It's an autonomic reflex.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.420]   So there's a lot of literature showing
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.060]   that within small groups or two people,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.960]   these physiological signals can be synchronized.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.180]   What this study found was that when people listen
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.580]   to the same story, but at different times,
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.760]   their heart rates start to synchronize.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.380]   This is incredible because people are listening
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.000]   to the story at different times,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.460]   but the gaps between their heartbeats
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.820]   become very stereotyped
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.660]   and map almost precisely onto one another.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.700]   That's incredible.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.820]   Now, we also know from an extensive literature
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.300]   that the quality and perceived depth of a social bond
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.140]   correlates very strongly
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.760]   with how much physiological synchronization there is
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.580]   between individuals.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.500]   In other words, when your bodies feel the same,
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.620]   you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.380]   And so this whole thing is a rather circular argument.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.980]   When you feel closer to somebody else,
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.040]   your physiology synchronize.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.140]   And the reverse is true as well.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.740]   When your physiologies are synchronized,
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.780]   you feel closer to other people.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.520]   This is what I call the concert phenomenon.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.260]   If you ever go to see your favorite band
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.080]   or you go to a concert that you particularly love,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.140]   you will often look over at somebody
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.040]   and you'll see them enjoying the same thing.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.440]   And they're often in a similar state as you are,
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.860]   maybe the sort of like favorite song comes on,
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.960]   and you actually feel connected to that person.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.800]   You feel like you're in,
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.820]   obviously there's a shared experience,
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.520]   but there's also a shared physiological response
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.700]   to that experience.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:39.060]   And so this can happen en masse with large groups of people,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.480]   or it can happen just between two individuals.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.200]   And as this study points out,
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.820]   it can actually happen between individuals
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.940]   without them actually interacting with one another
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.820]   when the story they are listening to is the anchor
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.740]   or the driver of their physiology.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.900]   This really points to the fact
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.100]   that the body and the brain are reciprocally connected.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.740]   Yes, indeed, what we think, what we hear, what we feel,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.220]   drives our physiology,
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.520]   our heartbeat, our respiration, et cetera,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.080]   but our heartbeat and respiration
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.260]   also are influencing our state of mind.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.100]   And in this case,
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.900]   it's encouraging certain types of social bonds
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.580]   when our heart rates are synchronized.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.940]   You can leverage this.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.940]   How can you leverage this?
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.780]   Well, let's take a upcoming example of the holidays.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.340]   There's a sort of a joke, I think it was Ram Dass,
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.060]   sort of Buddhist philosopher type that said,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.940]   "If you think you're enlightened, go visit your parents."
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.600]   And I think what he was referring to is that some people,
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.760]   not all people, have challenging relationships
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.600]   with their parents.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   We're going to talk about child-parent attachment
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.080]   and interactions in a few minutes,
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.340]   but some people have a wonderful relationship
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.820]   to both their parents and more power to them.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.440]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.900]   We should all be so lucky.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.620]   Many people have challenged relationships
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.460]   with their parents,
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.700]   or they have a great relationship with their parents,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.560]   but their parents know or they know how to drive that dart
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.520]   right into that particular soft piece
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.060]   of psychological flesh by saying just the slightest thing,
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.620]   or even by raising their eyebrow or rolling their eyes
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.100]   or the tone in which they do something.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.400]   This is also true between siblings.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.580]   I think many of you can think of examples
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.540]   where this is true.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   Many people, when they interact with others,
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.220]   expect that the mere interaction with the other person
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.700]   is going to create the sense of bonding.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.060]   And often that is the case.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.540]   For instance, if people are involved in intimate disclosure,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.660]   if people enjoy each other's company so much
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.540]   that just the mere sight of somebody evokes great feelings
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.860]   and it's mutual, that often can happen.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.700]   But in many types of social interactions,
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.180]   it's not the direct interaction with that person
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.560]   that makes us feel close to them,
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.200]   but rather it's shared experience.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.580]   And shared experience is shared physiology.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.660]   That's the point I'm trying to make by way of this study
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.800]   about conscious processing of narrative stimuli
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.360]   synchronizes heart rate of different individuals.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.020]   So for instance, if you have a somewhat challenged
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.600]   or a somewhat, let's call it a slight friction
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.540]   in getting close with somebody,
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.480]   or it can be a challenging interaction,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.760]   oftentimes it's very useful to focus outward
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.560]   on some other common narrative, a movie.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.620]   Oftentimes people will watch a game together.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:24.440]   Actually, there's a lot of critique that people or families
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.460]   will focus outward too much on external events.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.960]   But these external events can be observing the grandchild
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.980]   and how wonderful they are,
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.480]   or observing the meal and how wonderful it is.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.720]   Or as we commonly see in various traditions,
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.000]   there's a story that's repeated each year.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.420]   Certainly in the upcoming holidays,
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.220]   there's Christmas stories, there are themes and traditions.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.740]   And those themes and traditions
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.800]   anchor a number of different aspects of our psychology.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.720]   They're really wonderful.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.300]   They thread through the ages really,
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.900]   and allow us to link our own experiences up
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.080]   with previous generations and experiences.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.360]   But in addition to that, they synchronize our physiologies.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.960]   And so sometimes it can be useful
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   rather than expecting others to shift our physiology
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.400]   in the way that we wish,
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.640]   or us shifting their physiologies in the way that we wish,
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.680]   and then expecting some bond to mushroom out of that
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   in some beautiful way, to focus on some external stimulus,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.760]   to focus on something that will synchronize
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.080]   the physiologies of both people.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.460]   That can act as a bridge in order to establish social bonds.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.800]   And this is not a hack or a workaround
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.700]   for making terrible relationships good.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.740]   This is actually at the seat of what we come away
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.180]   from a social interaction with as feeling,
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.200]   wow, that was a really wonderful time.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.840]   Often, a really wonderful time can be by virtue
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.820]   of the specific things that were said,
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.440]   or the specific things that one engaged in.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.420]   But more often than not, the final common pathway,
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.040]   we should say, of great experiences
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.980]   was a great physiological experience
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.000]   and a shared physiological experience.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.580]   I have a short anecdote that relates to this.
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.560]   I have an older sibling,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.520]   and she used to say that when she was in college,
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.740]   the best dates that she ever went on were dates
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.680]   where she was asked to go out and listen to music.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.160]   She pointed out, however, that oftentimes
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.240]   the guys that would ask her out
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.360]   would take her to jazz clubs.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.760]   She always had the theory that they would ask her
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.520]   to jazz clubs because at jazz clubs,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.840]   typically you would sit down,
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.400]   and then she had to conclude that they couldn't dance.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.420]   My sister likes to dance.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   And so anytime someone actually had the nerve
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.740]   to take her dancing, those turned out to be particularly,
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.220]   let's just say, satisfying dates and relationships.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.280]   At least they lasted longer.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.120]   That's all I know about them.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.420]   That's all I want to know about them.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.060]   She's my sister after all.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.860]   But the theory behind whoever was asking her out
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.260]   on these dates was the right one,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   which is that if you want to bond with somebody,
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.800]   you create a common physiological response
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.460]   through a common and shared experience.
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.940]   And that is often a good entry way
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.040]   into establishing whether or not, it's always a question,
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.300]   whether or not there can be common physiological experience
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.140]   between two individuals.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.440]   Up until now, we've been talking about social bonding
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.060]   through the lens of neural circuits
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.940]   that are already established.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.460]   However, early in the episode,
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.380]   I mentioned that these very neural circuits
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:05.100]   that are responsible for social bonding
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.240]   in adult forms of attachment,
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.320]   be it romantic or friendship or otherwise,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.240]   are actually established during development.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.420]   One of the more important and I think exciting areas
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.460]   of early attachment as it relates to adult attachment
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.460]   comes to us from the work of Alan Shore.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.460]   Alan Shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N, Shore, S-C-H-O-R-E,
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.700]   is a psychoanalyst who also has deep understanding
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.740]   of neurobiology of attachment,
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.060]   both in childhood and in adulthood.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.940]   And he's focused a lot on differences
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.820]   between right brain and left brain forms of attachment.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.740]   Now, in a early episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.740]   I touched into the fact that most of what's discussed
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.460]   in the general public and sort of pop psychology
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.380]   and even in some neurobiology courses
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.820]   about right brain versus left brain
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.780]   and one side of the brain being more emotional
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.060]   and the other side being more rational is completely wrong.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.360]   Most of what I see out there is actually backwards
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.100]   to the way things actually work.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.220]   And while there is some what we call lateralization
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.160]   of function, meaning certain brain functions
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.520]   are handled by neurons on one side of the brain or the other,
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.340]   the idea that one side of your brain is emotional
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.220]   and the other side of your brain is rational
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.420]   is just simply not true.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.620]   However, the work of Alan Shore
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.380]   points to some very concrete neural circuits
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:34.700]   that do have a lateralization bias,
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.780]   meaning they are more right brain than left brain
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.900]   or more left brain than right brain
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.400]   that underlies certain forms of attachment
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.940]   between child and parent, in particular, child and mother,
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.640]   and that these right brain isms, if you will,
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.880]   and left brain isms for attachment get played out
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.460]   again and again in our forms of attachment as adults.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.780]   So I'd like to talk about that work briefly now
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.980]   because I think it really points
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.540]   to a number of important features of how we establish bonds
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.540]   and the different routes to establishing bonds.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.300]   So within the field of psychoanalysis,
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   there's a longstanding discussion, of course,
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.820]   about the so-called unconscious or subconscious,
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.700]   the things that we are not aware of,
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.140]   and I think there's growing evidence pointing to the fact
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.620]   that at least one major component of the subconscious
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.880]   or the unconscious is the so-called autonomic nervous system.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.300]   The autonomic nervous system
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.900]   is the portion of our nervous system
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.380]   that controls our reflexive breathing, our heart rate,
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.660]   our skin conductance, meaning our sweating, pupil size.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.020]   It's the aspect of our nervous system
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.180]   that makes us more alert or more calm.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.820]   It's the so-called sympathetic, meaning for alertness,
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.340]   or parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.100]   parasympathetic for more calming responses.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.640]   Now, what Dr. Schor's work and the work of others
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.100]   is now showing is that early infant parent,
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.820]   in particular infant-mother attachment,
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.700]   involves a coordination or synchronization
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.560]   of these right brain circuits and these left brain circuits
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.740]   as they relate to the autonomic nervous system.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.800]   How does this play out?
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.720]   Well, it plays out where early on as an infant,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.620]   when you're born, you're truly helpless,
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.820]   you can't feed yourself, you can't warm yourself,
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.900]   you can't change yourself,
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.780]   and you certainly can't ambulate, walk anywhere
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.400]   to get the things that you need.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.940]   All of those functions, all of those needs, rather,
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.380]   are met by your primary caretaker.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.480]   Typically, that's the mother.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.220]   Fathers, of course, play a role also,
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.020]   but because of breastfeeding or even bottle feeding,
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.300]   typically mothers play a more prominent role.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.160]   I realize there are exceptions, but that's the general rule.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.840]   There are now brain imaging studies
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.100]   examining the brains of infants and the brains of mothers
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.800]   as they interact and showing that the physical contact
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.720]   between the two, the breathing of the mother and child,
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.760]   the heart rate of the mother and child,
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.960]   and indeed the pupil size of the mother and child
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.120]   are actually actively getting coordinated.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.540]   In other words, the mother is regulating
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.220]   the infant's autonomic nervous system primarily,
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.780]   and the infant is also regulating
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.540]   the mother's autonomic nervous system.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.180]   A small coo from a baby or a cry,
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.580]   which is a stress cry from a baby,
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.820]   will definitely regulate the autonomic nervous system
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.880]   of the mother.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   This whole right brain system is directly tapped in
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.420]   to the so-called oxytocin system,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.440]   and we'll talk more about oxytocin in a moment.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.840]   Oxytocin, again, being this peptide hormone
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.320]   that is involved in social bonds of all kinds,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.640]   but that at least in early childhood
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.080]   is very closely associated with milk letdown
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.540]   and milk production.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.660]   There's actually a lot of stimulation of oxytocin release
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.000]   in the mother by nursing itself,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.800]   so physical contact with the nipple
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.720]   and by the contact of skin between baby and mother,
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.040]   and there's specificity there.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.900]   It's not just any baby that can evoke
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:01.000]   the most amount of oxytocin release from the mother.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.340]   Now, however, there are examples where just holding a child
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.800]   will evoke oxytocin release in the non-parent
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.520]   or somebody other than the parent.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.160]   I think most people experience that.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.580]   That's the new puppy or new baby phenomenon,
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.480]   'cause indeed puppies can evoke oxytocin release as well.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.720]   The point is not that oxytocin is only released
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.460]   in response to the primary relationship
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.400]   or the mother and their child,
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.040]   but rather that the amount of oxytocin
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.560]   scales with how closely related one is
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.240]   to that particular child and vice versa.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.160]   So there's oxytocin release occurring
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.040]   in both the child and the mother.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.040]   So this right brain system
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.420]   is an emotional but autonomic system.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.380]   It is below our subconscious detection.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:47.080]   Now, as we get older,
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.720]   there's another system that starts to come into play
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   in parent-child interactions,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.260]   and this also comes into play
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.980]   in sibling interactions and so forth,
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.200]   and that's the left brain system as described by Alan Short.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   Now, again, this isn't about emotion versus rationality.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.580]   This is about autonomic
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.700]   versus more conscious forms of bonding.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.800]   So on the left brain circuit side,
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.540]   there is evidence for, based on neuroimaging studies,
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.060]   but also animal studies to support the idea
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.540]   that on the left brain side of things,
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.020]   there is a processing more of narratives
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.980]   that are very concrete, logical narratives, okay?
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.660]   And again, I have to zoom out and just really tamp down
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.700]   the idea that it's not that one side of the brain
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.920]   is emotional and the other side is rational,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.440]   but rather that these two things are happening in parallel,
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.840]   and that there's a bit of a dominance
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.680]   for the left brain circuitry
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.520]   to be involved in the kinds of bonding
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.180]   that are associated with prediction and reward.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.160]   So a good example would be reading to a child every night,
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.600]   sitting there and reading.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.100]   I can recall reading to my niece
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.520]   and seeing her parents read to her,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.360]   and she had no clue whatsoever with what they were saying
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   because she, well, at least I don't know,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.880]   but she certainly couldn't speak,
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.680]   but she liked looking at the pictures,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.580]   and it was a very predictable sort of interaction.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.260]   It was, okay, out come the books.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.020]   It was usually here's the bath, then there's the pajamas,
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.460]   then there's the lights go down, then out comes the book,
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.820]   and then there's the interaction between parent and child,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.920]   which of course usually also involves physical contact.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.200]   So it's not like the right brain system
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.260]   and the left brain system are operating separately.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.900]   They're operating in parallel,
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.020]   but that sort of prediction and reward
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.500]   kids like to be read to
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.980]   is generally mediated by this left brain system.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.100]   And this carries on as children get older
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.040]   and as parents take on and evolve their parenting roles.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.940]   It's very apparent that healthy social bonding
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.160]   between children and caretaker relies on the fact
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.860]   that both this right brain system
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.820]   and the left brain system are engaged,
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.940]   that there's a synchronization of autonomic function,
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.260]   meaning a joining together in actual somatic feeling,
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:58.400]   and that there's a synchronization of experience
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.260]   that's more about some outward or external stimulus,
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.420]   like reading a book or watching a show together
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.900]   or enjoying some common experience of a meal together.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.220]   And of course, as children get older,
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.900]   they're able to access more and more
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.620]   cognitively sophisticated things.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:13.820]   You can watch a movie with them
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.540]   and they'll make predictions about which characters
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.140]   are going to show up, for instance,
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.860]   or you can take them to a concert
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.620]   and they can appreciate the concert or play in that concert
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.940]   and they appreciate that they're being appreciated, okay?
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.000]   So there are a million different,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.900]   there's infinite number of examples here,
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.780]   but the idea is that there are two parallel circuits
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.320]   that are important for establishing bonds
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.340]   and that this is set up very early on in childhood
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.420]   and that it's neither emotional nor rational, but both.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.100]   Now, both of these circuits tap into the circuitry
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.180]   that we talked about earlier where dopamine is released
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.580]   and molecules like serotonin,
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.100]   which again is a neuromodulator more associated
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.220]   with feelings of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.420]   with our immediate surroundings and possessions
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.660]   rather than seeking of things and motivation
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.200]   and drive to go look for things,
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.840]   as is the case with dopamine.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.420]   So there's still interactions with those systems,
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.380]   but the work of Alan Shore has stimulated a lot of interest
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.620]   in what are these circuits
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.540]   that underlie these autonomic bonding,
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.580]   this matching of heart rate and breathing,
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.860]   and what are the neural circuits that underlie this bonding
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.480]   or this synchronization of experience
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.540]   on the kind of left brain side.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.980]   And the reason I find this model so attractive
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.960]   is that it's very clear that healthy child-parent bonds
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.100]   are established not by one or the other
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.100]   of these right brain or left brain systems, but by both.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.020]   And there isn't enough time to go into it right now,
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.900]   but some of you are probably familiar with this idea
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.780]   of anxious attached versus avoidant attached
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.300]   versus there's a kind of dissociative attached model
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.680]   of infant-parent bonding.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.060]   Just briefly, what's becoming clear
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.500]   from the neurobiological imaging studies
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.180]   is that as people start to advance into adolescence
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.720]   and adulthood and well into their elderly years,
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.700]   the same circuits that were active
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   and established in childhood are repurposed
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.820]   for other forms of attachment.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.060]   And that to have truly complete bonds
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.980]   with other individuals,
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.540]   but in particular with romantic partners,
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.020]   it's important that there be both synchronization
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.140]   of physiology and synchronization of these more,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.220]   I guess we could call them more rational
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.540]   or predictive type circuits.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.020]   So we can leverage this information.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.240]   We can start to think about what sorts of bonds to us
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.860]   feel very enriching and very complete.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.060]   We know that we can have, for instance,
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.020]   an emotional connection with somebody,
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.400]   but we can also have a cognitive connection with somebody.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.860]   I have many colleagues with whom I have
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.780]   deep intellectual connection and convergence with.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:56.020]   I wouldn't say that I have deep emotional connection
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.180]   with most of them, a few of them, yes,
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.380]   but most of them, no.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.140]   Others in my life, for instance,
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.820]   I have a deep emotional connection to,
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.340]   but not a lot of deep cognitive connection to.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.180]   A good example would be the connection that I had
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.580]   with my bulldog who unfortunately passed away,
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:17.580]   but Costello, we had a very close emotional connection.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.500]   It was based on touch, it was based on our walks,
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.900]   it was based on fun, it was very autonomic.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.880]   We rarely discussed, if ever, what we were doing.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.900]   We had a felt relationship
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.980]   as opposed to a cognitive relationship.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.640]   And while I'm sort of half kidding about that as an example,
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.280]   it's a really good example, it was a very real bond.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.220]   And in fact, just as a brief anecdote,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.060]   I can remember when Costello was a puppy
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.000]   and I was entirely responsible for his wellbeing,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.780]   like any parent of any infant,
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.440]   I lost my appetite for those few weeks
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.780]   when I was house training him,
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.240]   and I seemed to lose all ability
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.060]   to process any cognitive information.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.640]   Now, I was also sleep deprived,
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.180]   but I was entirely focused on the autonomic bond
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.220]   that we were forming.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.880]   Now, thankfully, that eventually
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.780]   was established pretty quickly.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.860]   Basically, I went on to just basically feed him,
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.480]   walk him and do everything for him,
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.760]   and we had a wonderful relationship.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.700]   Now, it's very clear that what we're talking about here
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.180]   is a form of empathy.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:18.220]   Empathy is the ability to feel,
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.580]   or at least think we feel what others feel.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.840]   Because again, as my colleague and the great bio engineer
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.860]   and psychiatrist at Stanford, Carl Deisseroth,
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.500]   has said, and he was a guest on this podcast,
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.440]   we really don't know how other people feel.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.960]   We just get the sense that perhaps
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.060]   we are feeling the same thing
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.260]   or we're feeling something different
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.060]   and we infer or we project what they might be thinking.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.700]   Empathy is this sense that we are sensing
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.340]   what other people are sensing, okay?
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.060]   And there's no real way to verify that
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.680]   except if you're measuring physiologies,
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.620]   you could get some insight into that.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.780]   In the clinical psychology
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.920]   and in the neurobiological literature now,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.340]   it's understood that there is both emotional empathy,
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.420]   like actually feeling what somebody is feeling,
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.700]   and what is now called cognitive empathy.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.700]   Cognitive empathy is this idea that we both see
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.580]   and experience something the same way at a mental level.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.140]   Emotional empathy is this idea that yes,
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:17.140]   I can feel what you feel at a visceral,
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.780]   somatic or autonomic level.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.340]   And it's absolutely clear that strong social bonds
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.700]   between children and caretaker
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.500]   involve both emotional empathy,
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.220]   this autonomic function, and cognitive empathy,
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.380]   that there's a mutual understanding
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.980]   of how the other person feels
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.340]   and how the other person thinks
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.840]   in order to be able to make predictions
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.220]   about what they're going to do.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.100]   It's also very clear based on the emerging literature
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.720]   that romantic relationships,
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.640]   and to some extent friendships,
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.100]   although friendships have been explored a bit less
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.200]   in the literature,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.100]   that emotional empathy and cognitive empathy
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.660]   are both required in order to establish
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.860]   what we call a trusting social bond.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.980]   And there's some beautiful experiments done
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.820]   using neuroimaging of two individuals
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.980]   playing a trust game,
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.740]   essentially a game where you're trying to predict
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.820]   the other person's behavior,
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.060]   whether or not they will behave in a trustworthy way.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.460]   And these experiments tend to use real money,
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.060]   so there's actually something at stake.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.760]   And you can more or less predict
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.340]   whether or not somebody feels a lot of trust
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.200]   for somebody else,
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.380]   and whether or not they believe they will act
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.000]   in a trustworthy manner
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.060]   based on whether or not they have high levels
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.340]   of both cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.660]   So for those of you that are seeking
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.000]   to establish deeper bonds or bonds of any kind,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.280]   it's important that you think about
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.120]   synchronization of bodily states,
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.660]   we talked about that earlier,
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.080]   and synchronization of cognitive states.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.780]   Now that doesn't mean you have to agree on everything.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.860]   In fact, oftentimes people who feel very close
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.700]   to one another cognitively and emotionally
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.860]   argue about all sorts of things
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.220]   and disagree about a lot of things.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.880]   In fact, we probably know,
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.060]   I certainly know people and couples
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.080]   that seem to bond through arguing,
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.040]   which is an interesting phenotype in itself.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.700]   But the point isn't that there be total convergence
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.360]   of opinion or stance,
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.480]   but rather that we understand how the other feels,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.100]   and we believe that they understand how we feel,
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.400]   that we understand how the other person thinks,
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.220]   and that they think that we understand how they think.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.540]   So it's a reciprocal loop between two people
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.540]   that involves this cognition and involves emotion.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.020]   And it's grounded, as Dr. Schor has pointed out,
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.380]   in our earliest forms of attachment.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.820]   And that makes perfect sense,
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.480]   because the same sorts of circuits
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.260]   that are responsible for social homeostasis,
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.840]   the kind of right brain and left brain circuits
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.220]   that are responsible for infant-mother attachment,
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.840]   and then later for more intellectual
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.340]   or predictive type attachments between child and caregiver,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.900]   are the exact same circuits that we superimpose
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.960]   into all other types of relationships
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.800]   throughout the rest of our life.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.200]   And I should just mention that for those of you
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   that might be thinking that you had a less than satisfactory
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.640]   infant-caretaker interaction or form of attachment,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.720]   you are not alone.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.740]   And in fact, much of the work that Dr. Schor focuses on
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.420]   is about how those early circumstances
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.520]   can be understood and rewired
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.100]   toward the development of healthy adult attachment.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.000]   And if you want to check out his work,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.220]   he's actually got a few YouTube videos out there.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:21.340]   Again, it's Alan Schor, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.360]   I'd love to get him as a guest on the podcast.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.260]   He also has a book, it's called "Right Brain Psychotherapy,"
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.400]   and it's an excellent book.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.560]   It's actually pretty accessible,
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.360]   even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.260]   I found it to be very interesting.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.040]   There are a lot of excellent references.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.100]   And again, if you're listening, Dr. Schor,
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.000]   you know Alan Schor, we'd love to get you on the podcast.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.800]   One of the key themes to understand
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.240]   about biological processes is that they often work
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.680]   on short time scales and longer time scales.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.880]   And up until now, we've mainly been talking about the stuff
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.760]   that happens on short time scales.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.680]   So the kind of synchronization of heart rate
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.760]   or activation of a given set of neurons
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.960]   that dumps some dopamine and causes us to seek out
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.800]   more social interaction or less, for instance.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.720]   But every biological circuit and function
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.760]   needs to have longstanding effects as well.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.080]   And typically, when you're thinking about
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.380]   longstanding effects in the brain and body,
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.320]   you start looking towards the hormone system.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.940]   It's not always the case, but more often than not,
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.920]   neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are pretty quick,
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.140]   whereas hormones have longer lasting effects.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.180]   In fact, a lot of hormones can actually travel
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.040]   to the nucleus of a cell and actually change
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.060]   which genes are expressed.
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:32.140]   So if ever there was a hormone or hormone-like molecule
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:35.940]   that's associated with social bonding, it's oxytocin.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:39.160]   And oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.420]   in the popular press.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.520]   I don't know why that is, but perhaps it's because
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.320]   of all the incredible things that oxytocin
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.240]   is associated with.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.720]   And it is indeed a lot of things.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.480]   So for instance, oxytocin is released in the brain
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.520]   and binds to receptors in different locations in the body.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.200]   And the moment you hear different locations
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.940]   in the body, receptors, you should think,
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.680]   well, it's going to have lots of different effects.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.840]   And indeed it does.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.800]   Oxytocin is involved in orgasm.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.500]   It's involved in social recognition.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.340]   That's right.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.920]   When you see people that you consider your people,
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.360]   your team, your group, your friends, oxytocin is released.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.680]   Even if you don't come into physical contact with them.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.200]   Oxytocin is also associated with pair bonding,
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.820]   the feeling that they are your person
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.660]   and that you are their person
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.580]   is a common language people use.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.440]   It's also associated with honesty.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.140]   Believe it or not, there are experiments that show
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:37.320]   that if people receive oxytocin through an inhalation spray,
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.600]   that they will be more honest
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.840]   and forthcoming about certain things.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.760]   And the oxytocin system and variants in the oxytocin system
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.600]   have also been associated with autism
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.660]   and various autism spectrum disorders.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.040]   So there's a huge range of behaviors that it's involved in
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   because you have receptors for oxytocin
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.720]   and lots of different brain structures
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.800]   and areas of the body that do different things.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.600]   However, there's some very consistent effects of oxytocin
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.980]   that are worth just listing off.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.000]   And then I'm going to talk about two separate pathways
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.320]   by which oxytocin can manifest its effects
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.400]   and how you can actually regulate oxytocin
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.220]   in ways that are interesting and perhaps useful as well.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.160]   First of all, oxytocin is involved
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.380]   in the milk letdown reflex, lactation.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.420]   This makes perfect sense.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.620]   There needs to be a cue by which the suckling on the nipple
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:27.040]   of the infant causes the release or letdown of milk
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.880]   and milk letdown and lactation is controlled by prolactin,
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.860]   another hormone, but also oxytocin.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.180]   Oxytocin is also involved in uterine contraction
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.320]   during childbirth.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.900]   It's involved in cervical dilation
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.520]   to allow the baby to pass out of the birth canal.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.680]   So it's involved in induction of breastfeeding and of labor,
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.200]   which is remarkable and especially remarkable
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.580]   given that in males, or at least in some male animals
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.880]   and in some male humans, and I do want to say some,
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.840]   and I'll get back to this,
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.160]   it can be involved in the erection response.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.080]   It can be involved in the orgasm response
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.400]   in both males and females.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.760]   Although there, there's a very interesting difference.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.500]   There's a little bit of controversy about this,
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.640]   but it does appear that in females,
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.440]   sexual stimulation and orgasm cause the release of oxytocin,
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.260]   whereas in males, sexual stimulation does not cause
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.640]   the release of oxytocin,
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.320]   but rather a different molecule vasopressin
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.920]   is triggered by sexual stimulation.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.840]   But orgasm does trigger the release of oxytocin in males,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.060]   but with a delay of about 30 minutes.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.120]   Why that is and the specific function of that is not clear,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.440]   but it does seem that oxytocin is involved
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.380]   in the sexual response in both males and females.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.460]   The main types of interactions that release oxytocin
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.240]   at high levels are, first of all,
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.920]   that the interaction be between individuals
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.600]   that see each other as very closely associated, right?
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.740]   So a infant and mother are very closely associated,
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.520]   whether or not it's an adopted infant or not,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.020]   oftentimes they are in close contact,
[01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.880]   oftentimes they are from the very body of the other.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.240]   And so the amount or the amplitude of oxytocin release
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.400]   tends to scale with how closely associated individuals are.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.520]   Just the sight of one's baby or smell of one's baby
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.040]   can evoke oxytocin release and vice versa from the mother.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.200]   Physical contact even more so.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.640]   In romantic partners, physical contact,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.960]   even the sight of a picture of a partner
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.620]   can evoke oxytocin release and sexual desire, also trust.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.620]   So there's this whole collection of psychological
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.880]   and physiological things that are packaged
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.100]   into the oxytocin system.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.560]   It's not just a one-way system.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.780]   Now, a lot of people out there have written to me
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.320]   asking about inhalant oxytocin,
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.720]   asking whether or not that can actually increase
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.080]   the depth or rate of pair bonding.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.380]   And there does seem to be some evidence for that.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.240]   Now, I think in most places, oxytocin is prescription,
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.720]   although it might be over the counter in others.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.520]   I don't know, you have to check where you are.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.900]   As far as I know, you can't just go out
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.800]   and buy oxytocin nasal spray, although you may be able to.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.880]   Forgive me, I'm naive to that point.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.920]   But it's interesting to note that some drugs
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.640]   that are being used in clinical trials
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.880]   for things like trauma and are also used
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.980]   in clinical therapeutic settings for increasing bonding,
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.860]   in particular MDMA, also called ecstasy,
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.800]   increase dopamine and serotonin, we know this.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.960]   Dopamine and serotonin have a vast number of effects
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.560]   throughout the brain and body that I've talked about
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.620]   some of them today in another podcast.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:31.020]   But one of the lesser appreciated effects of MDMA
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.460]   is that it causes huge increases, massive increases
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.660]   in the amount of oxytocin that's released
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.140]   into the brain and body.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.180]   And MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, while still illegal,
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.060]   as far as I know, certainly in the United States,
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.800]   but in most places throughout the world,
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.800]   is being explored in clinical trials,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.880]   not just for trauma, not just for depression,
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.980]   not just for eating disorders,
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.280]   but also for reestablishing what seem to be fractured
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.960]   or challenged bonds between romantic partners.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.080]   And while most of the attention has been focused
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.720]   on the dopaminergic and serotonergic aspects
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.460]   of the MDMA response, it's clear to me,
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.040]   based on my read of the literature,
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.760]   that the enormously elevated oxytocin that occurs
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.460]   during the consumption of MDMA is part of the reason
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.680]   why people experience during the MDMA session
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.960]   and post-MDMA session a much greater degree
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.800]   and depth of kinship or feeling of connection
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.680]   with that person.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.200]   And it's important to point out that that feeling
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.740]   of connection is of the autonomic type
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.040]   that I was referring to earlier, a la Alan Shore's work.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.400]   That it's not of the, oh, we think about things
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.560]   the exact same way, we agree on everything now.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.260]   It's more of that their physiologies are synchronized.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.160]   So much so that even in individuals within a couple
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.880]   where one does a therapeutic session and the other does not,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.040]   they still both feel quite more bonded to the other.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.560]   Now, oftentimes in the clinical therapeutic setting,
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.360]   both members of a couple or romantic partnership,
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.800]   whatever that form it may take, are consuming MDMA
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.020]   and then thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.580]   and this enhanced sense of bonding.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.400]   And again, it's this autonomic bonding,
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.220]   but it's so powerful, meaning the oxytocin response
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.280]   is so powerful that it doesn't even require
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.320]   that both individuals experience this huge inflection
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.720]   than oxytocin and that's because one person's physiology
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.800]   is influencing the other and oxytocin is this kind
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.100]   of bridging signal that occurs in both nervous systems,
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.760]   synchronizes things like heartbeat.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.120]   Obviously it's associated with touch.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.240]   And so if people are touching or people are engaging
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.920]   in the sorts of behaviors that I mentioned earlier
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.680]   that can increase oxytocin further,
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.280]   that's going to further increase the depth of the bond.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.120]   But the point here is that there's actually a hormonal glue
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.940]   between individuals, okay?
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.100]   Infant and mother, friends, teammates,
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.780]   romantic partners, and so on.
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.820]   And that hormonal glue is oxytocin.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:00.580]   Now, people vary in the extent to which they feel
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:04.340]   or have the capacity to feel bonded to anyone.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.340]   And it is now generally understood that some of that
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.820]   variation might depend on variations in oxytocin receptors
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.000]   or what are called gene polymorphisms for oxytocin.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.500]   Genes can have a number of different sequences in them.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.700]   They're nucleotide sequences.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.140]   We won't go into genetics right now.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.780]   A's and G's and C's and T's in various combinations
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.740]   are what make up the genes.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.780]   Genes are transcribed into RNA.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:32.780]   RNA is translated into proteins that affect cells, okay?
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:35.780]   The oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.660]   and variants in that gene change the amount
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.580]   and function of oxytocin.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.780]   There's a really interesting study
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.640]   published just this last year in a relatively new journal.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.720]   That journal has a kind of a unusual name.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.820]   It's Helion.
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.640]   I think it's Helion and not Helion, but Helion, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.420]   This is a cell press journal.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.800]   As far as I can tell, it's a very solid journal.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.460]   Certainly the cell press label is very stringent.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:04.000]   And this paper is entitled
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.740]   "The relation between oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms,"
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:12.000]   which just means changes in genes or variations in genes,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.340]   "adult attachment and Instagram sociability
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.660]   and exploratory analysis."
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.000]   This is a really wild study, but I like the study.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:19.840]   It's very thorough.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.940]   First author, last name, Carollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:28.660]   And what they found was that by analyzing the genetics
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.080]   of different individuals who are on social media
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.820]   and looking at how many people those individuals follow
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.700]   and how many people follow them,
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.100]   and what they come up with
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.060]   is a so-called social desirability index,
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.820]   they were able to correlate in a very straightforward way
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:50.340]   that people that carry certain variants
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.760]   in the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   actually seek out more online social Instagram interactions.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.960]   So some people I know, I won't name their names,
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.680]   only follow anywhere from zero to six accounts.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.760]   Other people follow thousands of accounts
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   and they take the ratio of how many accounts people follow
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.720]   versus how many followers they have.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.240]   Arguably not a perfect measure,
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.400]   but a nice one in the sense that you can do this
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.240]   in a completely unbiased way
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.640]   with many, many thousands of subjects.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.380]   And then they were able to get genomic analysis
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.000]   from a number of these subjects.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.600]   And it turns out that people who have, let's say,
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.040]   higher levels of oxytocin function
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.020]   or potential levels of oxytocin function
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:41.000]   actively seek out more social interactions on social media.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.320]   So this, I think, represents an important first
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.400]   in the area of how social media and data from social media
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.040]   are starting to merge with biological data
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.480]   in terms of predicting how avidly people will seek out
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.160]   social interactions of an online type.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.120]   And nowadays we hear a lot about how online we are connected
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.920]   but we're not really, what is it?
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.680]   We're communicating but we're not connected
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.200]   or the connections aren't real.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.040]   I think we're going to need to revisit that.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.960]   While I'm certainly a believer in the idea
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   that face-to-face communication and common interactions
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.080]   with people standing in the same space
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.620]   or playing sports together, enjoying music together,
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.880]   enjoying meals together is vitally important.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.000]   There's an entire generation
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.960]   or several generations of people that are coming up
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.280]   who much of their social interaction has been online.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.540]   And if you think about it,
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.980]   all of the things that we've spelled out earlier
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.560]   about common mental narrative,
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.760]   this left brain system, a la Alan Shore,
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.900]   or autonomic bonding or synchronization of heartbeats
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.240]   according to common stories,
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.460]   all that is happening in online social interactions.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.360]   When a thousand of us look at the exact same Instagram post,
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.920]   yes, we will have a thousand independent responses to that,
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.900]   but chances are many of us have a similar or same response
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.840]   based on the data that we talked about earlier
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.320]   in synchronization of heartbeats.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   And so we are socially bonded with other people
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.640]   through social media.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.500]   And it's very apparent that the oxytocin system
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.620]   is playing some role in that.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.440]   And this, if we zoom out, makes perfect sense
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.400]   because again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.620]   none of these systems were placed in us
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:23.060]   or are organized within us in order to encourage specific
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.840]   and only specific types of social interactions.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.020]   The one that we can say is absolutely critical
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.340]   is the child-parent interaction, right?
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.120]   Because children simply can't take care of themselves,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.180]   they need a caretaker.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.120]   I should have said caretaker, not parent.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.520]   But infants, if they're not taking care, will die.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.520]   But beyond that, we have evolved or come to realize
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.720]   many different types of social interactions.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.160]   And online interactions nowadays are very, very common.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.240]   I'm certainly involved in them.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.600]   I'm guessing you're involved in them as well.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.680]   We're involved in one right now, for example.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.840]   The oxytocin system is absolutely threaded through
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.400]   and largely responsible
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.320]   for those types of social bonds as well.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.240]   And incidentally, oxytocin is the name of the fifth song
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.080]   on Billie Eilish's second album, "Happier Than Ever."
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.160]   So we've covered a lot about the biology
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.440]   and indeed the neural circuitry and neurochemistry
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.240]   and neuroendocrinology of social bonding.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.720]   I want to make sure that I highlight the key features
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.140]   that go into any and all of your social bonds.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.320]   First of all, all social bonds have the potential
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.240]   to include both what we called emotional empathy
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.600]   and cognitive empathy.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.040]   And so if you are interested in establishing
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.000]   and deepening social bonds of any kind,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.560]   it's important that you put some effort toward
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.360]   this thing that we call emotional empathy,
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.820]   which is really about sharing autonomic experience.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:43.960]   Now, depending on the relationship,
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.240]   that will take on different contexts.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.020]   What's appropriate in one type of bond
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.320]   is not going to be appropriate in another type of bond.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.760]   Physical contact, for instance,
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.960]   is appropriate for certain types of bonds
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.600]   and not for others.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.560]   Nonetheless, emotional empathy
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.760]   and the synchronization of autonomic function,
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.060]   heart rate, breathing, et cetera,
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.820]   can be best accomplished by paying attention
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:07.440]   to external events, in particular, narrative, story, music,
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.040]   and perhaps sports or other types of experience
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.760]   as an external stimulus to drive synchrony
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.200]   of those internal states.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.880]   The other aspect of forming deep bonds
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.960]   is cognitive empathy.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.980]   Again, cognitive empathy is not about agreeing on things
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.020]   or viewing things the exact same way.
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.400]   It's about really gaining understanding
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.100]   of how somebody else thinks about something,
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.440]   really paying attention to that,
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.180]   and then paying attention to how you think about
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.720]   and feel about something.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.280]   So that's what cognitive empathy is.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.680]   So emotional and cognitive empathy together
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:45.040]   are what make up these really robust bonds of various kinds.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   Now, we also talked about introversion and extroversion,
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.560]   and I'd like to try and dismantle the common misperceptions
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.960]   about introversion and extroversion
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.680]   because when we look at the neural circuitry, as you recall,
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.520]   introverts are not people
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.700]   that don't like social interaction.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.360]   It's just that they feel filled up or sated
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.560]   by less social interaction than would be an extrovert.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.440]   And that's because at least according
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.680]   to the social homeostasis circuit model,
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.600]   they actually get more dopamine
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.060]   from less social interaction, okay?
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:19.600]   It's like somebody who's sated by less amount of food, okay?
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.640]   It doesn't mean they don't have the same appetite.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.380]   It just means that they get more from less.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:28.760]   Whereas extroverts get less dopamine release
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.320]   from an equivalent amount of social interaction.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.160]   And of course, these aren't precise measurements,
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.520]   but on the whole, extroverts need more social interaction,
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.480]   more frequent, more long-lasting, et cetera,
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.520]   in order to achieve that dopamine threshold.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.800]   Because again, dopamine is driving
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.280]   that craving of social interaction.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.500]   And once it's met, then people don't feel
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.200]   like they have to seek social interaction as much.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.800]   So for those of you that feel
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.000]   as if you're an introvert or extrovert,
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.080]   or that no introverts and extroverts,
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.720]   it's not about how verbal people are.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.360]   It's not about how much they seek out
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.420]   social interactions per se.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.240]   It's about how much social interaction
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.120]   is enough for the given person.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.200]   Now, the whole reason for providing this framework,
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.820]   this biological circuitry, et cetera,
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.760]   is not to simply put a reductionist view
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.200]   on things that you already realized and knew,
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.200]   but rather to give you some leverage points
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.340]   to understand how is it that you form social bonds?
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.640]   How is it that you might be challenged
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.560]   in forming certain types of social bonds?
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.500]   And to think about entry points
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.240]   to both establishing and reinforcing social bonds
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.620]   of different kinds.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:36.640]   Hopefully it will also give you insight into why breakups,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.820]   whether it be between friendships or romantic partners,
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.620]   can be so painful.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.200]   A breakup of any kind involves both a breaking
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.320]   of that emotional empathy and that cognitive empathy.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.640]   And indeed it has a neurobiological
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.160]   and hormonal underpinning, right?
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.320]   We go into some sense a social isolation,
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.760]   even if we're surrounded by other types of people.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.580]   If one of our major sources of oxytocin,
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.880]   or one of our major sources of dopamine,
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.720]   suddenly is not around,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.880]   that is incredibly devastating to a nervous system.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.360]   And to borrow from the great psychologist
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.600]   and neurobiologist, Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.120]   who says, "We are not just individuals,
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.360]   "we are nervous systems influencing other nervous systems
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   "and their nervous systems are influencing us."
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.400]   I think that's the right way to think about it.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.380]   So it should come as no surprise
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.400]   that breakups of various kinds are very challenging,
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.620]   regardless of what underlied that breakup,
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.780]   whether or not somebody moving or an actual decision
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:35.300]   of one person to leave the relationship or both, et cetera.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.140]   On the more positive side, largely biological,
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:43.300]   but to some extent psychological view of social bonding
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.900]   will also allow you to orient in this vast landscape
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.660]   that we call social bonds,
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.480]   to understand why it is perhaps
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.480]   that you seek out so many online interactions.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.880]   Maybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.720]   that causes you to want more,
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.080]   follow more accounts or interact more with people
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.680]   and comment more, respond to comments, who knows?
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.600]   I'm also hoping that it will allow you to get a lens
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.720]   into how you can strengthen the social bonds
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.080]   that you want to strengthen
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.720]   and to establish new social bonds
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.600]   that you want to establish.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.020]   None of this is meant to manipulate or leverage social bonds
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.940]   that wouldn't otherwise form.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.200]   To the contrary, it's about identifying
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.480]   what are the specific routes
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.160]   by which social bonds are created
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.760]   and allowing you, I hope, to work with people
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.520]   that you feel challenged in forming social bonds with,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.540]   or maybe deciding to completely divorce
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.160]   from those social bonds entirely,
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.320]   because there's absolutely no hope
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.960]   of ever forming emotional or cognitive empathy.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.200]   I certainly acknowledge that that could be the case too.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.540]   So there's both a light and a dark and a gray zone
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.600]   to this entire thing that we call social bonding.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.540]   What is not graded, but is absolute, as they say,
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.900]   is that social bonds are vitally important
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.340]   to us as a species,
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.820]   whether or not they are at a distance over social media,
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.340]   whether or not they are in close proximity,
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.480]   actual physical contact.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.000]   Today, what I've really tried to illustrate
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.840]   is that there are a common set of biological,
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.140]   neurochemical, and hormonal underpinnings
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.900]   to what we call social bonding.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:15.320]   And so while it is complex and it is subjective,
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.660]   it involves the hierarchies,
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.220]   it involves our previous upbringing,
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:22.020]   it involves our goals, et cetera,
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.260]   it is not infinitely complex.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.820]   And in that sense, it is tractable.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.780]   Hopefully I've offered you some levers or some entry points
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.420]   under which you can both understand
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.100]   and move towards social bonds
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.720]   that would be more satisfying and more gratifying for you.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.980]   That's certainly one of the goals.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.520]   The other one is that hopefully if you're a clinician
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.440]   or simply the friend that people go to
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.780]   or the family member that people go to
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:45.060]   when they are challenged
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.580]   through various challenges and social bonds,
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.860]   that you can start to perhaps pass along
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:54.240]   some of the information as a way of people understanding
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.440]   what they're going through as they are breaking up,
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.200]   but also as they are falling in love,
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.860]   as they are forming attachments
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.780]   and as they are being challenged with attachments.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:02.900]   That's my hope.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.180]   And especially as you head into the holidays
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.880]   and end of year, but also as it continues into 2022,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.420]   I would hope that you would take this knowledge
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.820]   and apply it in any of the ways
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.840]   that you feel are meaningful and adaptive for you.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.300]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.060]   That's perhaps the best way to support this podcast.
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.200]   And we have a Patreon.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.740]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:56.480]   And there you can support the podcast
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.100]   at any level that you like.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.020]   We didn't talk about supplements on today's episode
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.600]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but on many episodes we do.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.620]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.940]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.860]   for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep,
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:14.620]   for things like focus, immune system, et cetera.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.640]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.820]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.600]   The reason we partnered with Thorne
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.820]   is because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:27.620]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.820]   that they include in their supplements
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.500]   and the precision of the amounts
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.020]   of the supplements that they include.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.100]   This is not true for a lot
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.580]   of other supplement brands out there.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.420]   Thorne is partnered with the Mayo Clinic,
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:38.580]   with all the major sports teams,
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:41.200]   so there's tremendous confidence in their stringency.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.820]   Again, if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.300]   you can see all the supplements that I take.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.420]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:50.540]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:51.420]   through that portal,
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.040]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.180]   that Thorne makes.
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.020]   If you're not already following the Huberman Lab
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.620]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.540]   On Instagram, I regularly teach short snippets
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.640]   about neuroscience and neuroscience-related tools.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.280]   Some of that information overlaps
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.780]   with what's covered on the podcast.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.520]   Often it does not.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.320]   So check us out at Huberman Lab on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.380]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:17.340]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.500]   (upbeat music)
