[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.460]   All right, so we'll start with questions about deep work.
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.140]   Our first such question comes from Tyler.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.380]   Tyler says, I'm a subscriber to Top Performer Executive Edition,
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.420]   as well as a few other professional optimizing services.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.100]   All right, so just as an aside, Top Performer is one of two online courses
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.140]   that I offer with my longtime friend Scott Young.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.340]   So Top Performer is a course about applying deliberate practice to get better
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.500]   at your career.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.660]   All right, back to Tyler's question.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.780]   My understanding is that there is a lot of focus on building skills that move
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.980]   the needle in terms of hard skills.
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.340]   But I wanted to see if you could touch on developing projects around increasing your
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.900]   exposure and image alongside your deep work projects to build their impact and
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.020]   grow your CV.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.740]   Tyler, be very wary here.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.780]   This is a trap.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.620]   There is a clear trap here that I'm talking to you about from personal
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.120]   experience.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.580]   The trap of focusing on exposure, marketing, presentation.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.100]   How do I get the word out about this?
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.660]   How do I get the message just right?
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.580]   It is a trap because those efforts are seductive.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.580]   They're kind of hard, but not too hard.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.820]   And it's something your mind would much rather do than the actual deep work to
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.740]   produce the stuff that you're producing, trying to promote in the first place.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.780]   You look at things like what's my email funnel or my social media promotion plan.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.740]   And what you see is what I used to call checklist productivity.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.580]   This is something you can get better at by learning the right checklist.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.700]   I went and I learned how to do online marketing.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.860]   And other people don't know this, that are just off the street.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.900]   Now I have this insider knowledge and I follow this checklist and I have this
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.620]   funnel here and I have this social media strategy there and I'm spending some money
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.580]   on this graphic design here and it's all immensely fulfilling and it's not really
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.740]   challenging and it begins to take up all your time.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.540]   But in the end, what matters?
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.300]   Producing something so good it can't be ignored.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.940]   So it is a trap.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.460]   Now I said this is from personal experience.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.820]   It's because this is where I was when I first began to develop my concept of
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.820]   deep work, I was relatively early in my graduate student experience at MIT.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.220]   I was doing research and was thinking too much about what's the topic of my research?
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   Like can I find a sexier topic?
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.220]   And if I promote it just right and talk about it right, you know, I was thinking
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.100]   too much about this.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.780]   Like an idea for the research that would catch attention and get coverage.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.620]   And it was then that I came across Steve Martin's professional autobiography,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.100]   Born Standing Up, and it was then when I watched the Charlie Rose interview of
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.420]   Steve Martin where he said to Charlie, "My advice to people is be so good they
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.900]   can't ignore you."
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.140]   This was a huge turning point.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.860]   Because what I learned was, no, write papers to get cited.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.780]   Do really good work.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.020]   It's really, really hard and the rest will work itself out.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.020]   That notion got ingrained in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.620]   That notion got developed into my book, Deep Work, as well.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.020]   Be so good they can't ignore you.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.380]   Don't worry so much about how you let people know.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.900]   Now, it's not to say that other stuff is not important, but you should just get some
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.820]   reasonable evidence-based practices for how you present stuff or how the promotion
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.140]   works.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.100]   Set that on autopilot so you're not making unforced errors.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.980]   You're not handing out flyers at the mall.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.820]   Like, yeah, okay, figure out some reasonable stuff to do.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.300]   Set it on autopilot and then get your attention back to producing stuff that's too good to
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.580]   be ignored.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.420]   If you look at these two scenarios, I've produced something excellent and I have a reasonable
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.820]   autopilot promotion machinery in progress.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.780]   Compare that to another scenario where I produce something pretty good but have a cutting-edge
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.380]   promotional apparatus.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.540]   I think all about it.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.820]   That first scenario is going to dominate the latter.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.820]   People find good things.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.220]   You can help them a little bit, but don't think too much about that step of actually
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.020]   making an impact.
