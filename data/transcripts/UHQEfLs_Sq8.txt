[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   As we draw near the end of 2020, we should take a few moments to look back on the year.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.720]   It's been an eventful one for sure.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.840]   It's been heartbreaking, it's been sorrowful, and yet it's also been full of joy as well.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.440]   Pastor John, as you look back on 2020—I know a lot has happened in your world—as
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.240]   you look back on this year, what has God been showing you?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.280]   As I look back over 2020, the most fundamental experience for me that colors everything else
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   and has shaped everything else is the experience of sweeter fellowship with God and with Jesus
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.920]   through His Word and through the mercies of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   As I have tried to figure out why this is, I think the most persistent reason that I
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:03.400]   come up with is that I have lived this year as though walking along the precipice of eternity.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:13.440]   COVID-19 means that floating around me in the air are invisible viruses that specialize
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.160]   in killing 74-year-olds.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:26.680]   And then add to that, my city blew up last summer, and 1,500 businesses near my home
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.740]   were burned.
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.000]   And even through the election, buildings just blocks from my house were boarded up out of
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.640]   fear at what might happen with the election results.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.960]   And as Noelle and I have sat together in the evening, night after night, month after month,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.200]   she would read to me the statistics of the thousands in Minnesota who are infected anew
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.440]   with the virus and the numbers of how many had died and what their ages were.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:06.160]   So more than any other year of my life, this one has been lived with an almost daily consciousness
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.260]   of my mortality and the ease with which the entire infrastructure and social order could
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.200]   dissolve all of this while causing us grief for so many who suffer.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.040]   It sounds odd, I know, for me to say, "This year's been good for me," when so many have
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.720]   died, so many suffer.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.320]   I mean, not just suffer from the disease, but suffer economically.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.160]   When all of that is taken into account, I have to say this has been very good for me,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.480]   very good for me.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.320]   A keen sense of my own mortality and a realistic view of the inevitability of meeting Jesus
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.480]   face to face momentarily, perhaps, or quite soon, has had the effect, both privately and
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.240]   with my wife and with others, of making the bread of heaven sweeter and the living water
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240]   more satisfying.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.640]   I just read, in fact, yesterday in John 10, "I am the door.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.280]   If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture."
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   And I suppose I've read John a hundred times.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.080]   Why would it be that now, just now, in the closing of this year, that phrase "finding
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   pasture" would stand out to me as obvious and real and precious and sweet and a palpable
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.480]   reality?
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   Jesus promises me that during the pandemic, if I come to him and he becomes for me the
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.760]   single door to God, to reality, to life, to joy, then I'll be like a sheep going into
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:06.000]   his secure sheepfold and coming out to graze in pastures of beautiful provisions and perfections
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   of Christ, right in the very midst of the pandemic and the crumbling culture.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.360]   So in answer to your question, Tony, it's been a sweet year.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.560]   It has.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.200]   You said that this experience of sweeter fellowship has colored and shaped everything else this
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   year.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   What did you mean by that?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.520]   Do you have any specific examples?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   I suppose one of the easiest things to say about the effect of a pandemic on my life
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   would be to say that it shut down all travel and a good many speaking engagements and therefore
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.360]   freed me up to have a lot of time left over for productive writing.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.200]   But that's an easy thing to say quantitatively, but what I want to focus on is not so much
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.720]   the quantity of time that this enforced seclusion has produced, but the nature of it, the nature
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   of the time, the nature of the seclusion, the nature of the effect and the way it connects
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.160]   with this sweetening of the fellowship with Jesus.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.680]   For example, I finished three books this year.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   Finished three.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.800]   I didn't finish three whole, but finished three.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.520]   But the one that has occupied my mind the most is called "What is Saving Faith?"
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.040]   subtitled "Reflections on Receiving Christ as a Treasure."
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.400]   Now that book that I wrote during my writing leave last summer is riveted on the question
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.080]   of what the actual experience of saving faith is like, and the answer to that question is
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   it is like drinking living water with satisfaction.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.440]   Saving faith is like eating bread, the bread of heaven, with pleasure.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.720]   It's like basking in the light of the world with delight.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:14.360]   In other words, the very subject matter of that book has been my experience, especially
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.560]   during this year.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   That's what I meant when I said that the experience of sweeter fellowship with Jesus,
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   sweeter drinking, sweeter eating, colors everything, like the books I wrote.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   And then, besides that book, I finished the two-year project on providence, which I think
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   is supposed to be available in January.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.960]   And the point of that book is that God's all-pervasive, all-embracing providence, his
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:58.320]   purposeful sovereignty will guarantee that God's elect people from every tribe and language
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   and nation will perfectly glorify him in the age to come precisely through the enjoyment
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.280]   of eating the bread of heaven and drinking the living water and basking in the light
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.320]   of the world, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   So this purpose that God has for all the world, in all the details, by his providence, this
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.800]   purpose cannot fail because of God's all-embracing providence.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.520]   And then thirdly, I wrote that little book, Coronavirus and Christ, back in April, which
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.880]   was simply an application of providence and the purposes of saving faith to the pandemic.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.600]   One of God's purposes in the pandemic, I argued, is to summon the world, the whole
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.720]   world, to bring their lives into alignment with the infinite worth of Jesus Christ, the
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.720]   Son of God.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.400]   And of course, that alignment means drinking the living water with satisfaction, eating
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.080]   the bread of heaven with pleasure, basking in the light of the world with joy because
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.800]   God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in him.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.000]   So that's what I had in mind, Tony, when I said that this experience of the sweetness
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.920]   of fellowship with Jesus has shaped everything else I've done this year.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   That's really good.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   I know book writing is a passion of your life, obviously, but that's not the only thing that
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   you do.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.560]   I mean, obviously we do this podcast as well, and before the month ends, before the new
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.400]   year begins, we're actually going to devote a whole episode just to looking at the stats
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   of APJ.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   I'm going to do a whole episode just by myself, just walking through those stats.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.880]   There's a lot of updates to give on the year of 2020 and what it has meant for the podcast.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.040]   What about the effect of this?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.920]   You called it "enforced seclusion."
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   What has been the effect of that on your video series that you do, "Look at the Book"?
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:02.840]   When I realized that I would have weeks—I forget how many—but weeks of unplanned time
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.560]   that was supposed to be dedicated to international travel, what filled my heart—and I didn't
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.920]   see this coming, frankly, I think it's of God, that's what I'm counting on—what
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:22.400]   filled my heart was the desire to give myself to this online Bible teaching method we call
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   "Look at the Book" as never before, and to set a goal for the rest of my life—and
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:34.800]   of course, only God knows whether that's conceivable in his providence—namely, to
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.240]   work my way through all the letters of the Apostle Paul, all 13 letters in "Look at
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   the Book."
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.640]   So I plowed into Ephesians.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.680]   Like, "Here we go!
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.360]   Get this going!"
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.440]   Actually, that's a lousy analogy, because you don't plow into Ephesians.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.880]   It's the Matterhorn.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   You don't plow the Matterhorn, right?
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.280]   In fact, it would be wrong to say, "I started climbing the Matterhorn of Ephesians," because
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.840]   the book starts at the top of the mountain.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:17.760]   You've got to have a helicopter of the Holy Spirit to drop you in verse 4 at the top of
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.120]   the mountains, so that's not right either.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:32.480]   Whatever you describe it, I've done at least 175 labs up through chapter 4 in Ephesians,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.400]   and I'm eager to finish it very soon and get on to the next book, and I'm not even
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.320]   sure what book is going to be next.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.360]   So that's my answer to the question of, "Okay, you've got extra time here.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.680]   What are you going to do with it?"
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:51.320]   And we've got new sights set on some major efforts with "Look at the Book."
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   Yeah, amen.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.320]   You not only work full-time for Desiring God, but you're also the chancellor of Bethlehem
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.720]   College and Seminary in Minneapolis, and 2020 was a big year for that side of your life.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.160]   Can you walk us through some of the highlights of what 2020 meant for the school?
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.040]   The most important thing that I was a part of at the college and seminary was the search
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:22.480]   process for discerning God's call on the next president of the school.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   Tim Tomlinson has led us for about 12 years now, coming up on 12, since the school's
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.200]   founding, and Tim announced last year his readiness to hand off the leadership after
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.720]   a long and fruitful—amazingly fruitful—tenure.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:49.360]   And after a long process, over a year long, the trustees voted unanimously to call Joe
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.320]   Rigney, who is the professor of theology and literature at the college now, to be the next
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.000]   president of Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.400]   And to watch God work in this process was a beautiful thing.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:10.760]   It had its ups and downs, but overall, I stand back and I say, "Wow, what a privilege to
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:19.080]   have been a part of God's work in setting the stage for the next decades of our beloved
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   school."
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:28.280]   I am profoundly thankful for Tim's founding leadership, and I am profoundly hopeful and
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.080]   thankful for what Joe brings to the school.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.240]   That has been a historic moment for the school, and in my life in particular.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.280]   And I know it's getting long, Tony, but before we sign off, I should throw a question
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   back to you.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.440]   I'm not the only senior teacher at Desiring God.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.400]   David Mathis, for example, our executive editor and senior teacher, published a book this
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.960]   fall for Advent.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.600]   Some of us are right in the midst of using it for our Advent celebration.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.320]   It's called The Christmas We Didn't Expect.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:13.200]   So he's a productive teacher, and you not only do Ask Pastor John, but you have a writing
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.320]   life of your own.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.780]   And so I'm pitching it back to you, Tony.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.760]   What have you been doing this year in your amazingly productive writing efforts?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.040]   I normally love asking the questions, but yeah, here I am finishing a big project.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.640]   Yeah, this next book for me is the most ambitious one I've ever attempted to write.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.960]   It's my most intense writing project.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.840]   And it's due at the end of next month, at the end of January.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.880]   It's titled God, Technology, and the Christian Life, and it's with our friends at CrossWipe.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.160]   It will be out, Lord willing, in January of 2022.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.960]   So it's kind of a capstone book to my smartphone book, 12 Ways, and then a book I wrote on
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.400]   mass media culture called Competing Spectacles.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.240]   This is sort of like the third book in a series.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.380]   Tony, pause right there.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.880]   Say something about the translation of that book.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.680]   Competing Spectacles has been translated now into five different languages and continues
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   to grow.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.920]   Yeah, I think 12 Ways is now, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You is now into nine languages.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   And so it's just amazing.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.680]   It's the work of CrossWipe, and they have a whole team devoted to that.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.160]   And DG has a team devoted to translation.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   It's amazing.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.800]   It seems like every other week I'm getting an email or a picture on Instagram.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.040]   No, no, it's incredibly encouraging.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.560]   So, this book, God, Technology, and the Christian Life, is the hardest book I've ever attempted
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   to write because I wanted to press into nine key sections of scripture and see if we can
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.040]   come up with some clarity over how God relates to human innovation.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.240]   And very specifically, is God inside of Silicon Valley, or is he on the outside of Silicon
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   Valley?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:55.160]   How does he relate to scientists and innovators, men like Einstein, men like Steve Jobs?
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.680]   Does God make these men?
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.080]   Does he gift these men?
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.720]   Does he merely permit them to exist, or are they sort of flukes in the system?
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.960]   How do we think through these types of guys?
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.320]   And then on top of that, I try to answer whether or not, just as we look around the material
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.880]   creation, are there any clues to tell us how God designed technology to unfold over time?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.480]   So I've been writing this for over 18 months now.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.760]   As my travel got shut down and the coronavirus hit, I was like, "You know what?
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.600]   I wanted to spend a lot more time researching this book.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.040]   I wanted to spend several years researching it."
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.920]   But the Lord seemed to say, "Nope, travel's ended.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.200]   Get to work on this hardest book I'll probably ever write."
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.960]   And so here I am coming to the end of it.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.000]   So I would appreciate prayers in these final weeks as we get to the end of that writing
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   project.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   But we need to wrap this episode up.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.520]   Pastor John, do you have any closing thoughts to share with us as we end today?
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.360]   Well, before I say anything by way of closing, let me just observe, Tony, that I'm not aware
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.640]   of anybody doing quite what you're doing with regard to technology and Scripture.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.920]   I mean, lots of people think about technology and write about that.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.200]   Lots of people think about Scripture and write about that.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.240]   But I don't know of anybody doing what you're doing, and I commend it.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.160]   I'm excited about it.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:13.200]   To put together God's Word with God's world in this way is really quite a remarkable thing.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.480]   I appreciate that.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.920]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.080]   To close this up, let me just say thank you to our listeners here near the end of the
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.520]   year who support Desiring God, make our work possible.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:32.000]   My prayer for the new year for you is that you would drink deeply from the fountain of
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.440]   life and that you would eat the all-satisfying bread of heaven and that you would bask in
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.760]   the light of the world, Jesus Christ, and that he would become more precious to you
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.680]   in 2021 than ever before.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   Amen.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.480]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you to our generous ministry partners that make all
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.360]   of these labors possible.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.000]   All of this work is possible because of your generous giving.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.040]   We are grateful that we get to do what we do.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.560]   And speaking of what we do, we are going to return on Friday with another one of your
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   excellent questions.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   Until then, I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   (Break)
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   (Break)
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   (Break)
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
