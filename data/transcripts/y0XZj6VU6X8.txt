[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Let's have term limits for Members of Congress and Senators.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.640]   Let's not have any corporate PAC money or any PAC money, any lobbyists.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.760]   Let's have term limits for Supreme Court justices.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.180]   Let's ban stock trading and also ban Members of Congress from becoming lobbyists.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.180]   This was common sense things.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.220]   And I think people are so starved for restoring trust.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.940]   Now, here is the honest truth in my view.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.860]   Most Members of Congress, of the 435, at least 300 to 350 have good motives going in.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.160]   They want to do the right thing, they may disagree.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.320]   But we're in a situation where we have lost the trust of the American people.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.780]   Most Americans think Members of Congress are lying, they think they're corrupt, they think
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.780]   they're self-serving.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.620]   I don't care that we have good intentions.
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.900]   That's the perception.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.860]   We've got to take some bold steps to clean up the system so we can do these big projects
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.960]   of rebuilding the country.
