[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.100]   - You talked about the purpose of all this
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.560]   isn't just to have a boatload of money.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.920]   It's not just to be a billionaire and all that.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.040]   And you've talked a lot about philanthropy.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.560]   So, and how that's become a more,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.680]   a bigger focus in your life.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.720]   And I think beyond just saying why it's important,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   you've thought about ways to infuse it
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   into your future business, your future endeavors.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   Talk a bit about why it's important,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   but also how you're trying to bring it
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.720]   into your business that maybe is different
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.320]   than the way most people think about philanthropy.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   - Few ways that I'm looking at it right now.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480]   First of all, like, I, everyone believes this,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360]   but I really like internalize it.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600]   It's that like, nobody gets out alive.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.040]   Like we all die and it doesn't make sense
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.400]   to be the richest guy in the graveyard.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.240]   Like, I don't care about legacy.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.080]   I don't care about my kids being rich.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.440]   Like I don't plan to actually give my kids anything.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.360]   Maybe they'll get a little bit,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.840]   maybe they'll get a property or two, whatever.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.400]   - No, they get the college savings property.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.880]   - Yes, they get the college thing, yeah.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.400]   And what's great about that too, by the way,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.640]   just to go way back to the last episode
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.680]   that we did together, but that property,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.000]   like I don't care if Rosie takes that one property
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920]   and goes to college with it, or she starts a business.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.160]   I actually hope she'll just start a business with it
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.320]   or invest it in something.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.000]   But anyway, I don't need my kid to be rich
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.440]   because A, like you can't grow up in the Turner,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.520]   the Brandon Turner household and not have all the skills
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.800]   you need to be successful, first of all.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.880]   'Cause like, I'm going to train her.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.760]   I train him every day.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760]   I'm always talking about money and finances
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.400]   and entrepreneurship and Rosie has bake sales
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   and Wilder will, you know, when he's a little older.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   So either A, if they're not wealthy by the time
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.080]   they're in their mid twenties,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   then there is some problem
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.040]   that they don't deserve the money anyway, right?
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.920]   Like my kids will either not need the money
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.520]   'cause they'll be so successful anyway,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   or they don't deserve the money because they can't handle it.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.840]   So anyway, that's why I'm not planning
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.080]   to give my kids money.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.600]   So in other words, what do I do with it then?
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.640]   I mean, wealth is kind of a game in some ways.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.720]   Like I don't have to earn more money and get wealthier,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.920]   but it's kind of a fun, it's a fun challenge.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   Like, can I give away a billion dollars?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160]   Like, I would have laughed at that 10 years ago.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.520]   And now I'm like, well, shoot.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.560]   Yeah, I could definitely give away a billion dollars.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.480]   Plus happiness is largely derived for most people
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.360]   by giving away money and not just like throwing
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   something from random charity,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.640]   but by doing something with it.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   Like it's one thing to make money.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.720]   It's another thing to make money matter.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440]   So I wanna spend a lot of my time making money
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.560]   'cause I'm good at it.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.200]   I'm not just gonna like give away all my money right now
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.680]   and go live under a bridge.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800]   Like I have been gifted with this ability
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.640]   to generate mass amounts of money.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.960]   So I'm gonna use that to its fullest ability.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   And then I'm gonna make that money count.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   I'm gonna make it matter through business.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.360]   So a couple of ways we do that.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   Number one, there's like the obvious,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240]   like we try to take good care of our tenants
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.400]   and be good people and all that.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.960]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.280]   I wanna start, we're gonna start,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.240]   actually we're gonna launch it hopefully
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.080]   in the next couple of months.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   We're gonna raise capital for big apartment complexes.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.520]   And then we're going to take all the profit from that
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.560]   and just donate it.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.240]   So for example, let me give you a real simple.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   We buy a $100 million building right now.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's pretty normal by let's say $100 million building.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.400]   We have to raise 20 or $30 million from investors like you.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   You give the money, we will buy the property.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.240]   At the end of the deal, we sell it for $150 million.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.560]   Very normal, very just 3%, 4% per year
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   over the course of 10 years, it gets there.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.440]   And then at the end of the deal,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.400]   everyone gets their money.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000]   We divide up all, everyone gets their piece of the pie
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.160]   and everyone is happy.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.560]   But what I wanna do is I wanna raise all that money.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.520]   And then at the end of the deal,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360]   when we sell the property two, three, four, five years later,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.880]   you get your investment back,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.320]   but all the profit, that $50 million goes to charity.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.120]   And I'm like, I could do like one of those a year
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.720]   and be like the biggest charity in the country.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   Like it's stupid how good real estate
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.360]   and especially my division of real estate,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.560]   syndication and multifamily,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   it's stupid how much profit we can create out of thin air
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.800]   and with that level of assuredness,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.520]   of that little surety.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.080]   And so if I can just take like one out of every 10 deals
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   I do and just donate it to good,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   that makes everyone feel good.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.280]   And then the LPs, even like you,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   if you were investing in that,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.000]   not only do you get to feel good,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.360]   not only do you get your money back,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.520]   so you're not even donating it,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.000]   you're just lending the money for a little while basically,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.720]   you also get a big tax write-off at the end.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.440]   And so it's like a win, win, win across the board.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.280]   Everyone feels good.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   Everybody wins.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   We're saving lives.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.360]   We're stopping human trafficking.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.680]   We're feeding kids.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   It's gonna be a good life.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.560]   So I'm fired up about that right now.
