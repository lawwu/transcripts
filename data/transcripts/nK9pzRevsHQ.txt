[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   - As you've said, quantum computing,
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.900]   at least in the 1990s, was a profound story
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.560]   at the intersection of computer science,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.920]   physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.880]   So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.440]   that represents more than just the quantum computer.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   But can we start at the very basics?
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.280]   What is quantum computing?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   - Yeah, so it's a proposal for a new type of computation,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720]   or let's say a new way to harness nature to do computation
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.800]   that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.080]   Okay, now the principles of quantum mechanics
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.600]   have been in place since 1926.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.640]   You know, they haven't changed.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.680]   You know, what's new is how we wanna use them.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.240]   Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.120]   You know, the physicists, I think, over the generations,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.760]   you know, convinced people that that is an unbelievably
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   complicated question and, you know,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.240]   just give up on trying to understand it.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.080]   I can let you in, not being a physicist,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.480]   I can let you in on a secret,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.080]   which is that it becomes a lot simpler
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320]   if you do what we do in quantum information theory
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440]   and sort of take the physics out of it.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.760]   So the way that we think about quantum mechanics
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.800]   is sort of as a generalization
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.280]   of the rules of probability themselves.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.280]   So, you know, you might say there was a 30% chance
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.640]   that it was going to snow today or something.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.480]   You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.440]   right, that would be nonsense.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   Much less would you say that there was, you know,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   an I% chance, you know, square root of minus 1% chance.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   Now, the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanics
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   made is that fundamentally the world is described by,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.800]   or, you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.840]   for, you know, what a system could be doing
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.480]   are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.000]   which are like probabilities in some ways,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.780]   but they are not probabilities.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.400]   They can be positive, for one thing,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.520]   they can be positive or negative.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.360]   In fact, they can even be complex numbers, okay?
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960]   And if you've heard of a quantum superposition,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.160]   this just means that some state of affairs
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.360]   where you assign an amplitude,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.560]   one of these complex numbers to every possible
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.260]   configuration that you could see a system in
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.280]   on measuring it.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   So for example, you might say that an electron
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.360]   has some amplitude for being here
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.200]   and some other amplitude for being there, right?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.660]   Now, if you look to see where it is,
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.400]   you will localize it, right?
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.060]   You will sort of force the amplitudes
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.160]   to be converted into probabilities.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.200]   That happens by taking their squared absolute value, okay?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   And then, you know, you can say either the electron
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.560]   will be here or it will be there.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.160]   And, you know, knowing the amplitudes,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.520]   you can predict at least the probabilities
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.480]   But while a system is isolated
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.600]   from the whole rest of the universe,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.320]   the rest of its environment,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.760]   the amplitudes can change in time
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.320]   by rules that are different
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.360]   from the normal rules of probability
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.440]   and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   So anytime anyone ever tells you anything
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.480]   about the weirdness of the quantum world,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.560]   you know, or assuming that they're not lying to you,
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   right, they are telling you, you know,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.000]   yet another consequence of nature
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.960]   being described by these amplitudes.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   So most famously, what amplitudes can do
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.960]   is that they can interfere with each other, okay?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.160]   So in the famous double slit experiment,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   what happens is that you shoot a particle,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.120]   like an electron, let's say,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.400]   at a screen with two slits in it,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.840]   and you find that there, you know, on a second screen,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.520]   now there are certain places
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   where that electron will never end up,
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.280]   you know, after it passes through the first screen.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   And yet, if I close off one of the slits,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.160]   then the electron can appear in that place, okay?
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.880]   So by decreasing the number of paths
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.400]   that the electron could take to get somewhere,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.120]   you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.000]   Now, how is that possible?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.440]   Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.480]   the electron has a superposition state, okay?
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.720]   It has some amplitude for reaching this point
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.480]   by going through the first slit.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.560]   It has some other amplitude for reaching it
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   by going through the second slit.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   But now if one amplitude is positive
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.400]   and the other one is negative,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.720]   then, you know, I have to add them all up, right?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.480]   I have to add the amplitudes for every path
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   that the electron could have taken to reach this point.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400]   And those amplitudes,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.500]   if they're pointing in different directions,
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.440]   they can cancel each other out.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.800]   That would mean the total amplitude is zero
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.940]   and the thing never happens at all.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.060]   I close off one of the possibilities,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.520]   then the amplitude is positive or it's negative
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.160]   and now the thing can happen.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.760]   Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is, okay?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   A quantum computer is a computer that tries to exploit,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.320]   you know, these, exactly these phenomena,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.800]   superposition, amplitudes, and interference
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.920]   in order to solve certain problems much faster
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.120]   than we know how to solve them otherwise.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.620]   So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.800]   is what we call a quantum bit or a qubit.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200]   That just means a bit that has some amplitude
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.720]   for being zero and some other amplitude for being one.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.080]   So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.160]   But now the key point is that if I've got,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.580]   let's say a thousand qubits,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.920]   the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.320]   that I do not just need one, you know,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.400]   I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.960]   Okay, in general, I need an amplitude
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.120]   for every possible setting of all thousand of those bits.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.720]   Okay, so that what that means
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   is two to the 1000 power amplitudes.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.480]   Okay, if I had to write those down,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.280]   let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.600]   if I had to write down two to the 1000 complex numbers,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   that would not fit within the entire observable universe.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.720]   Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   that if these qubits can all interact with each other,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.880]   and in some sense, I need two to the 1000 parameters,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.040]   you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.400]   Now, you know, now I can tell you know,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.040]   where all the popular articles, you know,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.340]   about quantum computing go off the rails is that they say,
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.800]   you know, they sort of say what I just said,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.520]   and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.760]   is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   So, you know, that sounds too good to be true.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.540]   And unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.880]   The problem is I could make a superposition
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   over every possible answer to my problem,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   you know, even if there were two to the 1000 of them,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.680]   right, I can easily do that.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.080]   The trouble is for a computer to be useful,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.200]   you've got at some point, you've got to look at it
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.280]   and see an output, right?
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.620]   And if I just measure a superposition
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.640]   over every possible answer,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.560]   then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.280]   that all I'll see will be a random answer.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.920]   You know, if I just wanted a random answer,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.360]   well, I could have picked one myself
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.200]   with a lot less trouble, right?
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.840]   So the entire trick with quantum computing,
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.560]   with every algorithm for a quantum computer,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   is that you try to choreograph a pattern
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.160]   of interference of amplitudes.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   And you try to do it so that for each wrong answer,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.840]   some of the paths leading to that wrong answer
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.520]   have positive amplitudes,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.680]   and others have negative amplitudes.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.160]   So on the whole, they cancel each other out.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.140]   Okay, whereas all the paths leading to the right answer
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.340]   should reinforce each other, you know,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.800]   should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.360]   - So the design of algorithms in the space
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.800]   is the choreography of the interferences.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   - Precisely, that's precisely what it is.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   - Can we take a brief step back?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.520]   And you mentioned information.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   - Yes.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.920]   - So in which part of this beautiful picture
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.360]   that you've painted is information contained?
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.240]   - Oh, well, information is at the core of everything
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.720]   that we've been talking about, right?
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.700]   I mean, the bit is, you know,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.000]   the basic unit of information.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.720]   Since, you know, Claude Shannon's paper in 1948,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.880]   you know, and you know, of course,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.960]   people had the concept even before that,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.920]   you know, he popularized the name, right?
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.740]   But I mean--
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.520]   - But a bit is zero or one.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   - That's right.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.180]   - So that's the basic element of information.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.120]   - That's right, and what we would say
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.280]   is that the basic unit of quantum information is the qubit,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.740]   is, you know, the object, any object
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.480]   that can be maintained in a,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.760]   manipulated in a superposition of zero and one states.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Now, you know, sometimes people ask,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.780]   well, but what is a qubit physically, right?
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.000]   And there are all these different, you know,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.440]   proposals that are being pursued in parallel
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.640]   for how you implement qubits.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.400]   There is, you know, superconducting quantum computing
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.160]   that was in the news recently
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.680]   because of Google's quantum supremacy experiment, right?
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.200]   Where you would have some little coils
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.960]   where a current can flow through them
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.000]   in two different energy states,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.240]   one representing a zero, another representing a one,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   and if you cool these coils to just slightly
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.560]   above absolute zero, like a hundredth of a degree,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   then they superconduct, and then the current
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.000]   can actually be in a superposition
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.440]   of the two different states.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.000]   So that's one kind of qubit.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.160]   Another kind would be, you know,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.400]   just an individual atomic nucleus, right?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.640]   It has a spin.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.700]   It could be spinning clockwise,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.840]   it could be spinning counterclockwise,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.700]   or it could be in a superposition of the two spin states.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.240]   That is another qubit.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.920]   But see, just like in the classical world, right,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.500]   you could be a virtuoso programmer
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.080]   without having any idea of what a transistor is, right,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.680]   or how the bits are physically represented
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.040]   inside the machine,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.920]   even that the machine uses electricity, right?
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.680]   You just care about the logic.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's sort of the same with quantum computing, right?
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.600]   Qubits could be realized
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.020]   by many, many different quantum systems,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.140]   and yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic,
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.940]   you know, the logic of qubits,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.140]   and how you measure them, how you change them over time.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.300]   And so, you know, the subject of how qubits behave
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.100]   and what you can do with qubits,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.900]   that is quantum information.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.580]   - So just to linger on that.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.420]   - Sure.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.220]   - So the physical design implementation of a qubit
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   does not interfere with that next level of abstraction
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.120]   that you can program over it.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.720]   So it truly is, the idea of it is, okay.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.460]   - Well, to be honest with you,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.440]   today they do interfere with each other.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.580]   That's because all the quantum computers
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.080]   we can build today are very noisy, right?
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   And so sort of the qubits are very far from perfect,
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.680]   and so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.240]   and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   Okay, but eventually where we hope to get
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.240]   is to what are called error-corrected quantum computers,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.280]   where the qubits really do behave
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.520]   like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.920]   And in that future, you know, a future that we can already,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.160]   you know, sort of prove theorems about or think about today,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.240]   but in that future, the logic of it
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.700]   really does become decoupled from the hardware.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.940]   - So if noise is currently like the biggest problem
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.100]   for quantum computing, and then the dream
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.780]   is error-correcting quantum computers,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.340]   can you just maybe describe what does it mean
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.460]   for there to be noise in this system?
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.420]   - Absolutely.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.260]   So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.980]   than noise, so the fundamental problem,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.100]   if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.940]   you know, of any appreciable size,
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.460]   is something called decoherence.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.020]   Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning,
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.220]   you know, when people first started thinking about this
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.700]   in the 1990s.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.740]   Now, what decoherence means is sort of
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.620]   the unwanted interaction between, you know, your qubits,
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.940]   you know, the state of your quantum computer
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.860]   and the external environment.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.860]   Okay, and why is that such a problem?
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.940]   Well, I talked before about how, you know,
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.460]   when you measure a quantum system,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.700]   so let's say if I measure a qubit
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.940]   that's in a superposition of zero and one states
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.460]   to ask it, you know, are you zero or are you one?
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.860]   Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.620]   And now probabilistically it chooses one or the other,
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.060]   and now, you know, it's no longer a superposition,
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.780]   there's no longer amplitudes,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.260]   there's just there's some probability that I get a zero
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.960]   and there's some that I get a one.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.900]   And now the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.020]   who's looking, okay?
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.700]   In fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.940]   any kind of interaction with the external world
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.940]   that leaks out the information about whether this qubit
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.100]   was a zero or a one, sort of that causes the zeroness
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.940]   or the oneness of the qubit to be recorded in, you know,
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.180]   the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.500]   in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.740]   As soon as the information leaks out,
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.780]   it is as if that qubit has been measured, okay?
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.860]   It is, you know, the state has now collapsed.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.740]   You know, another way to say it is that it's become
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.100]   entangled with its environment, okay?
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.580]   But, you know, from the perspective of someone
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.180]   who's just looking at this qubit,
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.480]   it is as though it has lost its quantum state.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.460]   And so what this means is that if I want to do
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.300]   a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.180]   sort of fanatically well isolated from their environment.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.060]   But then at the same time, they can't be perfectly isolated
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.260]   because I need to tell them what to do.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.540]   I need to make them interact with each other, for one thing,
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.460]   and not only that, but in a precisely choreographed way.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.660]   Okay, and, you know, that is such a staggering problem,
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.100]   right, how do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.500]   but then also tell them exactly what to do?
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.180]   I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.300]   and computer scientists in the '90s who said,
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.740]   this is fundamentally impossible, you know?
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.260]   The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.860]   to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.300]   Now, what changed the views of most of us
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.900]   was a profound discovery in the mid to late '90s,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.060]   which was called the theory of quantum error correction
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.300]   and quantum fault tolerance, okay?
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.980]   And the upshot of that theory is that if I want to build
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.380]   a reliable quantum computer and scale it up
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.940]   to an arbitrary number of as many qubits as I want,
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.660]   you know, and doing as much on them as I want,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.220]   I do not actually have to get the qubits
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.740]   perfectly isolated from their environment.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.620]   It is enough to get them really, really,
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.700]   really well isolated, okay?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   And even if every qubit is sort of leaking its state
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.500]   into the environment at some rate,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.140]   as long as that rate is low enough, okay,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.780]   I can sort of encode the information that I care about
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.060]   in very clever ways across the collective states
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.580]   of multiple qubits, okay, in such a way that even if,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.740]   you know, a small percentage of my qubits leak,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.580]   well, I'm constantly monitoring them
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.100]   to see if that leak happened.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.660]   I can detect it and I can correct it.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.020]   I can recover the information I care about
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.100]   from the remaining qubits, okay?
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.940]   And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.420]   even out of unreliable parts, right?
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.460]   Now, in some sense, you know, that discovery
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.780]   is what set the engineering agenda
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.740]   for quantum computing research
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.360]   from the 1990s until the present, okay?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.380]   The goal has been, you know, engineer qubits
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.300]   that are not perfectly reliable, but reliable enough
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.500]   that you can then use these error-correcting codes
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.900]   to have them simulate qubits
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.700]   that are even more reliable than they are, right?
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.740]   The error correction becomes a net win
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.420]   rather than a net loss, right?
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.540]   And then once you reach that sort of crossover point,
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.940]   then, you know, your simulated qubits
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.860]   could in turn simulate qubits
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.140]   that are even more reliable and so on
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.260]   until you've just, you know, effectively,
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.740]   you have arbitrarily reliable qubits.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.380]   So long story short, we are not at that break-even point yet.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.300]   We're a hell of a lot closer than we were
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.420]   when people started doing this in the '90s,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.020]   like orders of magnitude closer.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.740]   - But the key ingredient there is the more qubits,
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.700]   the better, because--
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.780]   - Well, the more qubits,
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.820]   the larger the computation you can do, right?
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.520]   I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.060]   of your quantum computer, right?
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.060]   - But also for the, sorry, for the error-correcting mechanism.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.660]   - Yes, so the way I would say it
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.480]   is that error correction imposes an overhead
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.980]   in the number of qubits.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.060]   And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.260]   with building a scalable quantum computer.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.740]   If you look at the error-correcting codes,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.140]   at least the ones that we know about today,
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.320]   and you look at, you know, what would it take
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.220]   to actually use a quantum computer
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.900]   to, you know, hack your credit card number,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.260]   which is, you know, maybe, you know,
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.960]   the most famous application people talk about, right?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   Let's say to factor huge numbers
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.660]   and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.220]   Well, what that would take would be thousands of,
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.800]   several thousand logical qubits,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.220]   but now with the known error-correcting codes,
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.740]   each of those logical qubits would need to be encoded itself
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.040]   using thousands of physical qubits.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.580]   So at that point, you're talking about
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.580]   millions of physical qubits.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.660]   And in some sense, that is the reason why quantum computers
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.580]   are not breaking cryptography already.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.540]   It's because of these immense overheads involved.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.060]   - So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.180]   - Well, it's multiplicative.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.580]   I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.120]   that you need in your abstract quantum circuit,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.440]   you multiply it by a thousand or so.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.560]   So, you know, there's a lot of work on, you know,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.620]   inventing better,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.120]   trying to invent better error-correcting codes.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.900]   Okay, that is the situation right now.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.900]   In the meantime, we are now in what physicist John Preskill
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.260]   called the noisy intermediate scale quantum or NISQ era.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.140]   And this is the era, you can think of it
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.760]   as sort of like the vacuum, you know,
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.020]   we're now entering the very early vacuum tube era
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.480]   of quantum computers.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.380]   The quantum computer analog of the transistor
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.200]   has not been invented yet, right?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.780]   That would be like true error correction, right?
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.200]   Where, you know, we are not, or something else
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.140]   that would achieve the same effect, right?
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.100]   We are not there yet.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.860]   And, but where we are now, let's say as of a few months ago,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   you know, as of Google's announcement of quantum supremacy,
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.420]   you know, we are now finally at the point
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.960]   where even with a non-error-corrected quantum computer,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.980]   with, you know, these noisy devices,
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.480]   we can do something that is hard
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.140]   for classical computers to simulate, okay?
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.320]   So we can eke out some advantage.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.880]   Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.900]   beyond what a classical computer can do
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.100]   that is also useful to someone?
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.380]   That we still don't know.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.180]   People are going to be racing over the next decade
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.260]   to try to do that by people, I mean, Google, IBM,
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.180]   you know, a bunch of startup companies, you know--
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.220]   - And research labs.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.860]   - Yeah, and research labs and governments
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.220]   and yeah, so--
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.700]   - You just mentioned a million things.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.300]   Well, I'll backtrack for a second and ask.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.820]   - Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.260]   - So we're in these vacuum tube days.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.740]   - Yeah, just entering, though.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.860]   - And just entering, wow, okay.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.060]   So how do we escape the vacuum?
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.060]   So how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.380]   Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.820]   Is there breakthroughs on the physics side
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.340]   that are needed on the computer science side?
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.380]   Is it a financial issue where a much larger
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.820]   just sheer investment and excitement is needed?
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.460]   - So, you know, those are excellent questions.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.860]   My guess-- - No answers.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.060]   - Well, no, no, my guess would be all of the above.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.820]   I mean, my guess, you know, I mean,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.140]   you know, you could say fundamentally
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.860]   it is an engineering issue, right?
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.780]   The theory has been in place since the '90s,
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.100]   you know, at least, you know,
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.100]   this is what, you know, error correction would look like.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.500]   You know, we do not have the hardware that is at that level.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.140]   But at the same time, you know,
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.020]   so you could just, you know, try to power through,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.980]   you know, maybe even like, you know,
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.260]   if someone spent a trillion dollars
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.180]   on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.740]   then conceivably they could just, you know,
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.220]   build an error-corrected quantum computer
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.300]   as it was envisioned back in the '90s, right?
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.140]   I think the more plausible thing to happen
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.180]   is that there will be further theoretical breakthroughs
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.060]   and there will be further insights
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.620]   that will cut down the cost of doing this.

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
