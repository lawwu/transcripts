[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.080]   the book of the prophet Isaiah in the 40th chapter verses 3, 4 and 5.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   Verses 3, 4 and 5 in the 40th chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.800]   The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord;
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.740]   Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.600]   Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low;
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.560]   And the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.200]   And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together;
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.080]   For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.840]   Now those who were present last Sunday evening will remember that we were considering together
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.520]   on that occasion the first two verses in this great and magnificent and mighty 40th chapter
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.200]   of the book of this prophet Isaiah.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600]   There we read these words.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.240]   Comfort ye my people, saith your God.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.560]   Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:46.000]   that her iniquity is pardoned; for she hath received of the Lord double for all her sins.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.080]   And I pointed out on that occasion that I was calling attention to the message of this
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:02.000]   great chapter because in it we have summarized very perfectly the whole essence of the Christian
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   gospel, the message of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.040]   The prophecy of this prophet, like all other prophets, had an immediate and a local reference.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.960]   But over and above that, this chapter of all chapters, as the New Testament itself shows,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.920]   that third chapter of Luke which we read at the beginning, is a very wonderful proof of
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.040]   what I'm saying, this chapter I say points on to those great and wonderful things which
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.600]   happened when the Son of God came into this world.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.120]   And I said that I'm calling attention to it because there is still nothing which is quite
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.280]   so said in this world as the way in which people misunderstand this gospel, fail to
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.760]   realize what it is.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.200]   There's no greater tragedy than that.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.280]   Look at it simply like this.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.160]   Ask an average person, "What, in your opinion, is a Christian?"
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.920]   And I think you'll be rather amazed and astonished at the answer you'll get if you compare that
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.120]   answer with the teaching which we have in this chapter or anywhere in the New Testament.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   And therefore it seemed to me that we could do nothing better than remind ourselves of
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.160]   some of these first principles, these fundamental postulates of the Christian faith and of the
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   Christian position.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.080]   More and more are we hearing at the present time that men and women who had never been
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.760]   Christian at all and had never called themselves Christians and who'd never gone to a place
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.080]   of worship of any description, suddenly coming to an evangelistic meeting or something else
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.720]   and hearing the truth and believing it, have said something like this.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.880]   They said, "You know, we'd never realized that that was Christianity."
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.360]   Their idea of being a Christian and what Christianity was was something entirely different.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.000]   Now, it's almost incredible, but we all know that that is a fact.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.440]   It is possible for us all, if left to ourselves, to go through life in this world and never
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   really to know what the Christian message is.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.160]   That of course is due to the fact that we're all the victims of prejudices.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   Every one of us.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.680]   We're all creatures of prejudice.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   It's no use anybody trying to say that he or she doesn't have any prejudices.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.960]   We've all had them.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.280]   It's something that has come into the whole of mankind.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.600]   The Bible tells us why that is so.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.640]   It tells us that there's a mighty power controlling the life and the thought of this world which
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.400]   it calls the devil.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.240]   And his one business is to fill our minds and our hearts with prejudices.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.680]   Prejudices against God.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.280]   Prejudices against the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.600]   Prejudices against the Christian faith.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.760]   The devil's one object is to keep people from God.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.120]   And he cares not how he does so, as long as he does that.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   And the commonest way of all is just to fill our minds with completely wrong notions as
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.720]   to what Christianity really is, and as to what the Christian message is.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   Well, very well.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   Now then, we looked at the first two verses last Sunday night.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   What do they say?
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.800]   Well, you notice, most astonishingly, they start with the great word "comfort."
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.920]   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.280]   It's something that comes from God.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.200]   It's God's message to men.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.480]   It is not just good living, or trying to be helpful and decent and kind.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.880]   It is primarily an account of something that has come from God.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.420]   The God whom we think is against us.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.880]   The God whom we, as natural men and women, hate because we always think he's against
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   us.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.400]   The first thing the Gospel tells us is this, that that God is a God of love.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.240]   And if he were not a God of love, he'd have left us and our world to itself, and that
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   would have been hell on earth.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.400]   But God, in spite of us, has sent a message into our world, and he's done something about
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   us.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   It's from God.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.240]   Then we emphasize the character and the condition of the people to whom he sends it.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.120]   They are people in a state of warfare, undergoing hard tasks.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.960]   We all, most of us that are here tonight, know what it is to be in a state of war.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.200]   We know something about the sufferings and the privations and the troubles and the agonies
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.120]   and the wretchednesses, everything that is associated with war and with warfare.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.920]   It's a time of toil and of trouble and of tribulation.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   Now the whole of mankind, according to the Bible, is like that.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.800]   That's the result of sin, our iniquity.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.520]   The sin and iniquity which are mentioned, they lead to that condition.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.560]   And it is to such people that God sends his great message, and it's a message of comfort.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.800]   It's an announcement and a proclamation of what?
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.240]   That our iniquity is pardoned, that God forgives our sins.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.000]   Not only that, more than that, that the warfare is ended, is accomplished, finished.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   A new possibility arises.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.040]   A great change in our condition is possible to us if we accept the message.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.400]   God himself sends it.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.680]   It's God who's done it, not man.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   Christianity is not something man has discovered, not something man has invented, not something
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   man does.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.640]   It's all of what God does.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.080]   And it's this great announcement that the warfare is accomplished or ended, that our
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:06.520]   iniquity is pardoned, and above all, the announcement that there are great blessings for us, double,
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.480]   infinitely more than all the guilt of our sin and all the punishment that we so richly
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   deserve.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.160]   Now that's the great message.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.320]   And that's the message that seems to come to people as a surprise.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.440]   They say, "I never knew that that was Christianity."
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.840]   But my friend, that is Christianity.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.120]   It's God coming to the soul and saying that, that though you may have sinned against him
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.200]   all your life on his conditions, he's prepared to forgive you.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.920]   And not only is he prepared to forgive all your sin, he's prepared to give you this new
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:50.880]   life, free from the serfdom and the bondage of the warfare, and that he will bless you
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   with blessings that even baffle description.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.200]   That's the great message with which it starts.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.080]   That's the great proclamation.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.720]   That's Christianity.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.400]   And it's something that can come to a man in a moment.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   It isn't a program that you take up and after much weary striving, at last, perhaps, just
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   about get there.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.340]   My friend, it's something that you can receive in a moment, anywhere, whenever you're ready
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.240]   to receive it.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   That's the message.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.480]   Very well.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   But naturally, the moment one says that, one asks a question.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.960]   How is all this possible?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.720]   How does this really come to us?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.920]   How does God do this kind of thing?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.880]   If that is Christianity, and if that is what Christianity does, how does it do it?
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   Now, that's a very important and a very vital question.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.880]   And that is the question which is answered in these verses that I'm asking you to consider
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.360]   with me this evening.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:01.600]   For here, I say, we are told exactly how God does this wonderful thing that he does to
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.560]   all who become Christian.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:11.840]   Here we are told how God pardons us and gives us free forgiveness, how he changes our condition
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:20.680]   and gives us a new start and a new life, and how he showers his mighty blessings upon us.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.600]   Now, I say that this is a very important question, and I am constrained to say that, I am bound
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.060]   to say that, for this good reason.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:39.280]   That unless we are perfectly clear as to how all this comes to us, we may very well be
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:46.680]   misleading ourselves or deluding ourselves, and falsely thinking and imagining that we
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.480]   are Christians when we are not.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.360]   Now there is a great danger confronting us here, and it's a danger which is very real,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.220]   I think, at this present time.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.800]   We are living in an age when men and women are tired and weary.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.160]   I won't go over that again.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.560]   That's the warfare that I described last Sunday night.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.600]   You always get that at the end of a war, and especially when you have had two world wars,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.520]   as we have had in this present century.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.960]   Mankind is exhausted, it's tired, it's weary.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.200]   We have been trying different things, we have been given promises and we have put our faith
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.880]   in them, but they don't seem to have materialized.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.200]   And men and women, I say, are at the end of their tether, and in that condition they are
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.600]   ready to believe anything and to clutch at anything almost that is offered them.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.040]   And there are many people who say at a time like this, "Yes, I want to know God, I want
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.960]   to be blessed by God, and I want these blessings that you are talking about.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.680]   I want comfort, I want peace, I want forgiveness of my sins."
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.800]   Well, that's excellent, but my friend, this is absolutely vital.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.820]   We must know how all that can be obtained.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.920]   We must receive these blessings in the only way in which God gives them.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   And that is, in a sense, the great message of this book, and especially of the New Testament.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   And it's all put to us very simply in these verses that we are looking at together here
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.280]   tonight.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:30.080]   These blessings of salvation come to us and come to us alone, in and through the person
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.920]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.400]   And they do not come to us and cannot come to us apart from him.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.800]   Very well, before we go any further, let me ask a simple question.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.520]   Do you desire this blessing from God?
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   Do you think you've had this blessing from God?
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.880]   Do you regard yourself as a Christian?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.520]   There's a very simple test that you can apply to yourself to make quite sure that
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   you're right.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   It's this.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.160]   Where does Jesus Christ come in?
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   Is he absolutely essential?
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.240]   Is he absolutely vital?
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.680]   Is he in such a position that if he were taken away, your whole belief and your whole situation
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   would collapse?
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.520]   That is the Christian position.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.320]   You see, therefore, the terrible danger of thinking that you can be blessed by God directly
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.040]   without Jesus Christ.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.080]   Oh, I know many people who think that.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.120]   I've known many such people.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.800]   I've known many people who've said to me, "Well," they say, "you know, I'm not a chapel
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.880]   goer and I don't, in a sense, call myself as you do a Christian, but, you know, I believe
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.400]   in God and I say my prayers regularly.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.560]   I've never given up praying, you know.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.400]   I've given up going to a place of worship, but I've always prayed and I believe God blesses
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.880]   me and answers my prayer."
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.320]   And I say, "Well, very well, then, you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but he doesn't come
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.260]   in."
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.760]   It's a very good thing to ask ourselves that question.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   Is Christ essential?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.680]   Oh, I've often said it from this pulpit before.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   Let me say it again.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.360]   When people talk to me about these matters, I just ask them one simple question.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:28.560]   I say, "If you had to die tonight and to stand before God, on what are you relying?"
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.600]   And very often this is what they say to me.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.840]   "Well," they say, "I've always tried to live a good life.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.120]   I've tried not to do any harm."
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   But I say, "Surely you don't claim to be perfect."
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.080]   "Oh, no, you've done things that are wrong."
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   "Yes, you've sinned."
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   "Yes, well, what about your sins?"
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.160]   "Well," they say, "I believe God will pardon me.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.200]   I believe God is a God of love, and if I confess my sins and ask him to forgive me, that he'll
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   forgive me."
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   I say, "Is that all?"
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.040]   They say, "Yes, I'm relying on that."
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.200]   I say, "But have you told me everything?"
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.160]   I say, "Are you sure that God will do that?"
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.240]   "Well, I believe God is a God of love," they say.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.480]   I press them hard with my questions, and they give me the same answer.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   You see the point?
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.260]   They never mention Jesus Christ at all.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.120]   He doesn't come in.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   He's simply literally not mentioned.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.000]   They are relying on the love of God and that God will forgive their sins.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.520]   Christ isn't mentioned.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.720]   Now that's the thing that I'm so frightened about and alarmed about, and I put it again
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.040]   as a blunt and positive assertion.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:37.280]   My friend, this message of comfort, of pardon and forgiveness, of new life and a new outlook
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:45.920]   and a new beginning, and the blessings of God, they come and they come alone and only
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.520]   There is no salvation apart from him.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.480]   And if you think you've got it, you're fooling yourself.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.320]   You've got a psychological experience, and it isn't Christianity.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.960]   I don't hesitate to say that.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.480]   Let me prove my case.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.640]   Here it is, I say, "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness."
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   What does he cry?
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.480]   "Prepare ye the way of the Lord."
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.760]   That's how it's going to come.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   A Lord is going to come, and without this Lord there is no blessing.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.680]   Now then, here I'm suggesting to you, we are again at the very heart and center and
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.360]   core of the Christian message.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   What is it?
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.600]   Well, it's first and foremost an announcement of something which is entirely new, something
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:54.760]   strange and wonderful, and at the same time something which is momentous.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   We have all noticed, haven't we, that this Bible contains two main books.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:09.320]   We talk about the Old Testament and the New Testament, the New Covenant, the New Dispensation.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.640]   Those are the terms that we use, and we use them quite rightly.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.840]   And here you see in this preliminary announcement, in this prophecy, we are reminded of all that.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   "Go," says God to the prophet and to his associates, "Go and tell the people that
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.560]   something new and passing strange is going to take place, something unheard of, something
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.160]   unpredicted, something that staggers the very imagination, something that has never happened
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.440]   before."
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.520]   In other words, the starting point in considering Christianity and the Christian message is
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.160]   to realize that we are face to face with the most unique event and happening that has ever
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:00.080]   taken place in the long history of mankind.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:07.380]   We must start, then, I say, by grasping this, that the Christian message stands absolutely
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.160]   alone.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.120]   There's never been anything like it, there never will be.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.800]   It's not in series with any philosophy, with any outlook upon life whatsoever.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.080]   It has a uniqueness and a distinctness and a separateness that puts it entirely in a
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.400]   category on its own.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.920]   "Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.120]   Someone great and strange and unusual is about to come."
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.480]   That's the announcement.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.600]   And that is, I say, the very essence of this message.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.040]   You can read in the Old Testament about saints and patriarchs, you can read about prophets
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.520]   and religious men, you can read about great leaders of the people.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:54.460]   It's not to detract at all from their greatness, nor to derogate from their value, to say this,
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.160]   that Christ doesn't belong to the series.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.680]   He is absolutely alone.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.400]   Oh yes, outside the Bible, the world has had great teachers.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   You've had your great pagan philosophers, that little land of Greece boasted of them
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   and their great men, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and the rest.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.400]   Other countries have had their religious leaders and teachers, Buddha, Confucius and all the
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   rest of these men.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.480]   Again, I say, it's no part of my business to criticize them or to detract from the value
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.480]   of their teaching.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.600]   But I'm here to say this again.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.960]   Jesus of Nazareth doesn't belong to that category either.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.400]   He is alone, he is unique, something special, something that's never happened before.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.880]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.480]   This is something that's never taken place before.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.000]   Be ready for it, make provision for it.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.320]   That's the message.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:01.680]   Now you see so much that we tend to pass as Christianity doesn't include that at all.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   You see, if to be a Christian is just to be a good man, the Old Testament's full of
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:14.760]   that, Greek philosophy is full of it, utopias, good living, idealism.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.840]   You see, that's where we go so sadly astray.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   If your Christianity doesn't start with this announcement that something has happened
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:30.760]   in this world of time which has never happened before, well, then I say it isn't true Christianity.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.360]   That's the first emphasis, but let me hurry to the second.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:43.040]   The way in which God gives us this mighty blessing is not only something new and strange,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:51.080]   it is nothing less than this, than the coming into this world of time of the Son of God
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   himself.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.800]   The voice of one crying in the wilderness, what does he cry?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:04.280]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.240]   The Lord!
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.760]   You can't think of a higher or a greater or a stronger term.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.360]   Jehovah!
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.040]   The Lord God Almighty is going to pay a visit.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   He's coming.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.400]   Prepare the way for him.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.920]   That's the message.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.540]   Now this is an old picture, isn't it?
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:34.640]   It was the custom of kings and important personages in that ancient world.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.680]   When they were travelling from one place to another, they used to send people before them
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.840]   to prepare the way.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.480]   They hadn't got tarmacadam roads then.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.360]   The roads were rough and bumpy and had what we now call potholes, and they rode in their
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.280]   chariots which hadn't got the springs that the modern motor car has.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.120]   So the result was that these great people, in order not to be put to inconvenience and
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.400]   not to be in commoded or to suffer on the journey, they sent the men before them.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.720]   And they prepared the way.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.760]   And when it was somebody very special, they made a new road for him, a great highway,
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   along which there had been no traffic at all, so that it should be even and smooth.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.360]   A highway was prepared, a new way, so that the great personage should travel along.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.320]   That's the picture.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   And what God tells the prophet to announce here is this, that now something very special
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.560]   and unique is needed, as I say, which had never happened before.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.120]   And why?
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.600]   Well, because someone is about to take a journey who has never taken that journey before, and
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.320]   it's the type of journey that's never been taken before.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:53.400]   There's no less than this, that God, the eternal God, is sending out of heaven his only begotten
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:23:02.160]   Son down into this world of time, right onto the earth.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.680]   That's Christianity.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.760]   It's this in its essence.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.280]   Not that mankind, in its painful process of evolution, not that man as the result of study
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.880]   and research and inquiry and investigation, at last has arrived at something, or that
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.280]   one man, unusually brilliant, has gone ahead of the rest and has discovered something about
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   God.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280]   That's not Christianity.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.360]   That's the very opposite of Christianity.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.840]   You know what Christianity is?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.280]   It's this.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:42.840]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his own Son, made of a woman, made
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.520]   under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.320]   God so loved the world that he gave, he sent from heaven to earth his only begotten Son.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   That's the journey.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.520]   That's the person who's coming.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:06.960]   And I say this is the most staggering and astounding and most momentous thing that the
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.480]   world has ever known or ever will know.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.800]   And the whole message of the Christian gospel is to announce that that has literally taken
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.640]   place.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.120]   The message of Christianity is not that God is love and that God's prepared to forgive
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.520]   us if we repent and drop on our knees and say, "Forgive me and give me life and strength
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   and power."
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   No, no, it isn't that.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:35.720]   It's this amazing, astounding thing which tells us that into this world in which you
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:44.520]   and I are alive at this moment, the very Son of God himself has come.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:52.840]   And that when that babe was born in Bethlehem and given the name of Jesus, he was none other
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   than the blessed person through whom we are told the world was made and everything that
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.920]   is in it, and by whom the very world consists.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:10.520]   In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.960]   Without him was not anything made that was made.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   That's him.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   What's the message?
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.440]   The Word was made fresh and dwelt among us.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:27.000]   Isn't it astounding that the whole world isn't clapping its hands as it thinks of
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   this?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.800]   Can you understand men and women ignoring him and living as if he'd never come?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.080]   They don't know about this.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.040]   That's why we are told to cry and to raise up our voices and to shout and to proclaim
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   it abroad.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   My friend, the whole message of Christianity is this, that nineteen hundred and fifty-four
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.600]   years ago this thing happened which had never happened before.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:55.240]   God the Son came into the world, literally was born as a babe.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:03.200]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.640]   That's how salvation comes.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.360]   Not simply God in his love looking down from heaven upon a sinner and saying, "I'll
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   forgive you."
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   No, no.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.440]   God sending forth his own Son and the Son coming and enduring all he did.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.940]   That, why?
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.500]   Because it is the only way.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.820]   That's the way in which the blessing comes.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.620]   Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.300]   Speak ye comfortably unto Jerusalem.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:37.580]   Say unto her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she shall
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.700]   receive double of the Lord for all her sins.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.700]   How does it happen?
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.260]   That's how it happens.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.500]   And it can happen in no other way.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.180]   Jesus is central.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.140]   Jesus is essential.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.580]   It is entirely in him.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:27:00.300]   Ah, yes, but let us go on.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:07.500]   The message of Christianity is, I say, to tell us that the Son of God has been in this
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.620]   world, has come into it, and has done something in it that has led to this wonderful blessing.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   But you know this?
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   It's here again.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.360]   Let me point it out to you.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:26.940]   That for his coming, the preparation of a new way is absolutely essential.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.540]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.340]   Make a highway in the desert for our God.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.740]   Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.460]   shall be made straight, and the rough places shall be made plain.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:51.560]   And then, when that is happened, the glory of the Lord shall be revealed.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.740]   What do you mean, Sir Simon?
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.540]   Well, let me tell you.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:02.340]   This new way is absolutely essential in two ways.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.740]   It is first of all essential in the matter of his coming into this world at all.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.100]   Let me show you this Christian message in the terms of this old picture.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.420]   You see, it's all there in that third chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.580]   That is, after all, the finest commentary on these three verses.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.380]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:29.060]   The question is, I say, how can God bless men?
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.500]   Is that a reverent question?
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.620]   Of course, it's not only a reverent question to ask, it's an essential question to ask.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.660]   God, my friends, is holy, is absolutely righteous and just.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   God can do no wrong.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.900]   God can't pretend that things are right when things are wrong.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.820]   God can't wink at sin and pretend it isn't there.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:57.140]   God is holy and absolutely consistent with himself in all his glorious attributes.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:06.180]   So the problem of sinful men and the forgiveness of sins does indeed raise a problem even in
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:12.100]   the mind of God.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:18.780]   God has given his law to mankind, and God insists upon that law being kept.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   How can that law be kept?
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.580]   There is no man who can keep the law of God.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.220]   Men fail to keep the law of God.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.620]   God gave them the law through Moses to define it in detail.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.740]   They try to keep it, not one of them succeeded.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.660]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.140]   All have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.100]   There is no man who can keep the demands of God's law.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.300]   All men have failed.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.180]   Well what can be done?
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:53.720]   I say again that before this problem can be solved, something absolutely new, something
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.340]   entirely unique must take place.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:03.580]   There is the need of a new way, something prepared which was never there before.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.500]   What is it?
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.900]   That is what is called the incarnation.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.980]   Do you know what the incarnation means?
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.660]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.020]   Here is the description of it.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:25.360]   Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be brought low.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.240]   Before you can have this even highway, this level road along which he can come, it is
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:39.280]   necessary to bring down, it is necessary to raise up.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:46.200]   And you know that that is exactly what happened when the Son of God came into this world.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.240]   Have a look for a moment at that little babe lying helplessly in the manger of the stable
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.620]   at Bethlehem called Jesus.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.640]   You can't imagine anything weaker, more helpless than a babe, an infant.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.560]   There he is.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.720]   But who is he?
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.560]   He is, as I've already told you, the eternal Son of God.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.520]   He is the Word, the eternal Word by whom and through whom all things were made and by whom
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.720]   they consist and exist.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.880]   And yet there he is, a babe.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   What's happened?
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   Can't you see this principle of the mountains and the hills being brought low?
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.560]   If you ask the Apostle Paul to describe it, he'll put it like this.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:43.520]   Though he was equal with God and counted it not robbery to be equal with God, yet he emptied
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.920]   himself.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.520]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.400]   He who is eternal in all his attributes became low.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.880]   He became even a babe.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:05.200]   He divested himself of the signs and the marks of his eternal glory.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.240]   He laid aside the brightness of his very countenance and all these obvious attributes of God.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:21.640]   He laid them aside and was born as a babe and took unto him human nature.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.160]   He was made in fashion as a man.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.200]   He had been in fashion as a God.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.360]   He came in the fashion of a man.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.920]   My friends, this is the New Testament teaching.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:39.320]   This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, that that one person is God and man at one and the same
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   time.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.680]   You see, the mountains and the hills have been made low.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.240]   There's been a coming down.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.000]   He came down from heaven to dwell amongst us.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.880]   And he had to come down in the sense I've been describing.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.240]   He lived as a man.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.480]   But look at the other side for a moment.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.240]   Every value we are told shall be exalted.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.440]   And this is an astounding part of this incarnation.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.480]   That's what we mean when we talk about the virgin birth.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:23.120]   Do you remember the message that was given by the angel that appeared to Mary, the earthly
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.240]   mother of our Lord?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.480]   When he visited her, he made this thing quite plain and clear, didn't he?
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.360]   He addressed her as one who was highly favored.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.320]   "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.560]   And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.040]   name Jesus.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.920]   He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.560]   And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.480]   the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.560]   Then Mary staggered and said, "How shall this be?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.520]   Seeing that I know not a man."
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.160]   And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.800]   the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.760]   Therefore also, that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.080]   God."
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.560]   You see, that is the exact thing that's happened.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.920]   There has been this raising of the values.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.160]   And when she went and spoke to her cousin Elizabeth, she said exactly the same thing.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:39.200]   "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb."
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.720]   And Mary herself realized something of this wonderful blessing.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.400]   Don't you see what it means?
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:55.720]   To this humble virgin, this privilege is given of bearing as regards the flesh the Son of
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   God himself.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.160]   The Creator enters into the womb of a woman.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.120]   What an honor, what a dignity!
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.640]   Every value shall be exalted.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.400]   The coming down, the raising up.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.280]   Human nature, as it were, is taken hold of.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.560]   This is a great theme in the Scriptures.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.640]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews in his second chapter puts it like this.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:27.000]   He says that God hasn't stretched out a helping hand to angels, but unto the seed of Abraham
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.480]   to raise them up again.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.280]   Every value shall be exalted.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.240]   Every mountain and hill shall be brought low.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.480]   That is essential before these blessings can come to you and to me.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.120]   You can't be blessed, you can't be forgiven.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.000]   There is no redemption tonight, and there is no new life for you unless you see that
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.680]   God has done all this.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.640]   That's what he's done.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.160]   He has sent his only Son into the world.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.280]   Do you remember the message as our Lord was there, baptized in the Jordan by John the
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   Baptist?
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   This, said the voice, is my beloved Son.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.880]   In thee thou art my beloved Son.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   In thee I am well pleased.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:32.880]   The Son of God, perfect man, yet the two in one person.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.560]   That is why I said at the beginning that he's unique.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.880]   He's not only a great man, he's God-man.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.560]   He's not only God, he's also man.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.760]   There's a new way.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.680]   Something has happened which has never happened before.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.320]   The Son of God has come into time, not as an appearance, not as a kind of theophany.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:37:01.920]   A new thing has taken place, a God-man, two natures in one person, indivisible, God-man.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:11.720]   Perfect man and perfect God, the new highway along which alone God's blessing can come.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.520]   My friend, it is essential that you and I should believe that before we can receive
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.520]   this blessing.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.480]   It isn't enough to pray, it isn't enough to give your heart to God, it isn't enough
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   to ask for forgiveness.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:29.560]   That's God's way of forgiveness and the only way of God's forgiveness.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.800]   And I could keep you for hours in telling you how this same thing continued, how he
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.440]   continued to humble himself by giving obedience to the earthly parent, how he suffered the
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:47.200]   contradiction of sinners against himself, how finally he gave himself to the death of
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.360]   the cross as if he hadn't got strength nor power, and listened to the mocking and the
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:57.080]   jeering and the taunting of men who said, "Let him save himself if he's the Christ.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.280]   He saved others, he cannot save himself.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.720]   Let him come down and give proof.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   He didn't.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   He'd come to die.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.040]   He humbled himself, he came down to that."
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.440]   And then he rose again, the coming down, the raising up.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.880]   It's the whole of the gospel everywhere.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.960]   There's nothing like Christianity.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.720]   There's nothing else that has this message.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.240]   But this is the Christian message.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:33.800]   Salvation and deliverance through God's only Son come in the flesh, dead upon the
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:39.880]   cross, buried in the grave, rising again in glorious resurrection.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.480]   That's it.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.680]   And lastly, let me say just a word about this.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.440]   This new way is also equally essential.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:59.680]   "Before he can come into your heart and into your life and mine."
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.960]   That was the message of John the Baptist, wasn't it?
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.080]   He is the immediate forerunner of the Son of God, and that was his message.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.280]   He is the voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.560]   path straight," and all the rest of it.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.200]   And what did he preach?
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:23.320]   He preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:30.920]   "He is about to come," said John, "the Messiah, the deliverer, the redeemer.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.040]   But if you want him, if you want to know him, if you want to experience him, if you want
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.720]   to be delivered by him, prepare the way," says John, "repent, flee from the wrath to
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.800]   come, repent."
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.160]   And what does he mean by repentance?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   Well, he means this.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.360]   It is all there in that third chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.560]   It means that we have got to recognize again God's law.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.160]   It is no use saying, "We have Abram to our father."
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.640]   "The ox is laid to the root of the tree," says John.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.200]   It is not a question of playing or of make-belief.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.440]   You have got to recognize again that God's law is holy and that God is righteous and
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   true.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.720]   You have got to put an end to all self-confidence.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.000]   These people would come and say, "We have Abraham to our father."
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "Why?" says John, "God could raise up of these stones children unto Abraham."
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.640]   In other words, if you want this blessing, you have got to realize that all the goodness
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   you have ever done is no value at all.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.680]   It is like filthy rags.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.200]   You have got to cease to rely upon the fact that you are an Englishman or a Welshman or
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:47.400]   a Scotsman or an Irishman or a Britisher or the supposed citizen of a Christian country.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:53.520]   You have got to realize that that is useless, worthless.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.840]   Self-confidence, confidence in parents, confidence in antecedents or in anything else, it has
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   all got to go.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:05.240]   And we have got to put a hypocrisy right out.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.800]   It is no use pretending before God, "The ox is laid to the root of the trees."
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.320]   It is not a mere trimming on the surface.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   It is the whole foundation that is going to be examined.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.160]   "That's it," says John, "I am preparing the way before this Lord is going to enter
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   into your life and redeem you."
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   That has got to be done.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:31.360]   I am here to lay a foundation and the only worthy foundation for Him.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.920]   So if you think that you can get this blessing from God and cling to your darling sin, you
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.840]   are fooling yourself.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.080]   If you just think it is saying, "Yes, I accept Christ and I give myself to Him," and
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.920]   then go on exactly as you were before, it is not Christian salvation, my friend, whatever
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   it is.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.480]   "The ox is laid to the root of the trees."
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.160]   "I indeed baptize with water," says John, "but one mightier than I cometh, the
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:07.720]   lecher of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:14.200]   with fire, whose hand is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, will gather
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:24.280]   the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   He will sift.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.280]   He will pick out the wheat.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.800]   He will destroy the chaff.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   He can't be fooled.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.560]   He is God and he has the eyes of God and he sees and knows all things.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.640]   You must repent, says John.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:45.440]   You have got to realize that you are sinners in the sight of a holy God.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.800]   You have got to give up making any excuse for yourself or relying upon any goodness
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.880]   that belongs to you or to anybody else.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:59.720]   You have got to realize that face to face with God you are a miserable, wretched, vile
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   sinner, deserving hell and nothing else.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.000]   And you have got to admit and confess that to God.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.840]   And then and then only are you ready to receive him.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.520]   And it's a fact, of course.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.200]   As long as you and I are looking to or holding on to anything else, we don't need him.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.880]   He is for paupers.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.200]   He is for sinners.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.280]   He said, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.200]   They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:41.600]   He came for people who are down and out morally and spiritually, who have got nothing at all.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.040]   There is only one highway that will bring him into your heart.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040]   It's this.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:58.160]   "To say to him, 'Just as I am, without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:07.800]   me and that thou bidst me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come.'"
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.960]   A new way was essential before he could come from heaven to earth.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   My friend, this new way is equally essential before he can come into your life, into your
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.680]   heart and transform it and give you forgiveness and give you new life and give you all the
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.120]   blessings that are offered.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:35.520]   Every valley and hill must be brought low.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.960]   There is no difference between a religious and an irreligious person before Christ.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.360]   It doesn't matter whether you have always lived in a place of worship or if you have
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.200]   never been into one until this minute.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.360]   It makes no difference at all.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.720]   The person who has been brought up in a religious way and who hasn't believed in Christ is
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:59.080]   in exactly the same position as a person who has come out of the foulest gutter in the
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.160]   land this evening.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.920]   No difference.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.160]   Every valley and hill shall be brought low.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.480]   And unless you have seen yourself thus brought low by Christ, you don't know him and you
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.720]   haven't been blessed by him.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.200]   But if you have come in and are painfully aware of your sinfulness and your blackness
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:27.520]   and your vileness, I am happy to tell you, every valley shall be exalted in him.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.160]   He will raise you up.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   He will wash you.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   He will cleanse you.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.760]   He will clothe you with his own righteousness.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.400]   And you won't be able to recognize yourself.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.440]   That's it.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.320]   That's the Christian message of salvation.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:49.680]   That's the comfort that comes tonight to all of us, that though we are sinners and weak
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:46:00.080]   and helpless, God's own Son came into the world to redeem us, to rescue us.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.240]   He took on our nature.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.120]   He even died for our sins.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.720]   And he will raise us up.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:23.880]   The Son of God became the Son of men, that the sinful sons of men might be made sons
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.120]   of God.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.900]   Are you a son of God?
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:39.720]   That is the only condition, the utter, absolute recognition of your desperate, hopeless need.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:50.380]   What he has done and what he can do for you and in you, what he will do if you but ask
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.780]   him to do it.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.780]   Ask him now.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   Amen.

[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:46.780]   I would call your attention to the first notice on the cards which you find in the pews,
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:56.780]   which tell you, and tell you very genuinely, that I am very glad always to see anybody whom I can help further in this momentous matter.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:04.780]   In the midst of life we are in death, we are but passengers and strangers and sojourners in this world.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:12.780]   There is no greater tragedy than for a man to go out of it without knowing that the Son of God came into it
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   to bring this great redemption. If I can help you further, give me the privilege of doing so.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:29.780]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:36.780]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide with us now this night,
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short uncertain life and earthly pilgrimage.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.780]   And evermore. Amen.
