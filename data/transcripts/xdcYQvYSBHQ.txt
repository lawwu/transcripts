[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   No smartphone before high school. We have to clear this all out of middle school. Middle schoolers should not be having the internet in their pocket.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.180]   Give them a flip phone, give them a phone watch, give them something else, but not a smartphone.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:19.020]   No social media till 16. Social media is wildly inappropriate for minors. It's full of extreme sex, violence, men from all over the world reaching out to you because they want sex.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.940]   I mean, it's insane that we have children talking with men all over the world.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.060]   The third norm is phone-free schools. Lock up the phones in a yonder pouch or in a phone locker in the morning. They get it back at the end of the day.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.020]   And the fourth norm is far more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.020]   Because until the 1990s, kids had a childhood. They were outside a lot. They had adventures. They learned to be self-governing, self-supervising.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.520]   We took that away from them beginning in the 90s. Totally gone by 2015.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.160]   So our kids never get any fun or adventure. So all they have is their screens.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.820]   That's my basic proposal.
