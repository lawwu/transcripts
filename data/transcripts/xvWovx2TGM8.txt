[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Several times in this podcast,
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.160]   we have looked at 1 Peter 3, 7,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.960]   but only briefly and never at length.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   Now's our chance.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.660]   Today's question comes to us from a listener named Patricia.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.400]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   What does Peter mean in 1 Peter 3, 7
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.520]   when he writes that husbands should live with their wives
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.160]   in an understanding way as the weaker vessel?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.880]   Specifically, what is the weaker vessel?
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.760]   Is she physically weaker, emotionally weaker,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.720]   spiritually weaker, or something altogether different?
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.640]   Thank you for your help, Pastor John.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.460]   What would you say?
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.680]   - Well, let's begin with a literal translation
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   of the verse she's asking about, 1 Peter 3, 7.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.080]   Here's the way I would translate it.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.320]   Likewise, husbands, live together according to knowledge
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.660]   with your wives, although that phrase with your wives
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.820]   is not there in the original,
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.360]   but it's implied by live with.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   As with a weaker vessel, the feminine one,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.120]   showing honor as also living together
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.260]   with fellow heirs of the grace of life,
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.900]   which I take to mean eternal life
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.380]   because of the use of the word grace and life
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.160]   back in 1 3 and 1 13,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.380]   in order that your prayers may not be hindered.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.300]   So Peter is saying to husbands,
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.620]   as you live with your wives,
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620]   consider two central realities that you should know.
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.060]   Now, there's according to knowledge.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.580]   Here's what you should know.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.120]   One is that you, husband, are the stronger
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.780]   and she is the weaker vessel.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.460]   And the other fact that you should live in the light of
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.340]   is that she shares with you in the glory of being
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.580]   an heir of God.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.580]   So two things govern a Christian husband's demeanor
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.300]   toward his wife in this verse.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540]   The fact that she does not share
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900]   his superior masculine strength
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.740]   and the fact that she does share
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.140]   the glory of being an heir of God.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.100]   That's very significant.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.500]   I don't think Peter made any mistake there
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.200]   or was writing carelessly.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Her being weaker draws out of him one kind of honoring
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.980]   and her being a fellow heir of glory
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.660]   draws out of him another kind of honoring.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.660]   And those two ways of being drawn out to this woman
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.940]   interweave to create the unique Christian beauty
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940]   of what Paul calls headship and submission.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.500]   So Patricia's question relates specifically
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.020]   to the term the weaker feminine vessel,
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.900]   the weaker vessel, the feminine one.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.820]   So three words need explanation, right?
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.860]   Vessel, what's that?
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860]   Feminine, weaker.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.460]   Let's start with vessel.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.980]   The first thing to notice is that she's called
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.020]   the weaker vessel, meaning the husband is a vessel.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.460]   All right, you got two vessels,
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.420]   weaker and stronger vessel.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.300]   She's not just a vessel, he's a vessel
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.220]   'cause she's the weaker and he's the stronger vessel.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.140]   Probably the root idea behind that
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.760]   is that the male sexual organ is a vessel
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.740]   and the female sexual organ is a kind of vessel.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.160]   The male vessel is a giving, dispensing vessel
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   and the female organ is a receiving, accepting vessel.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.180]   So in the very act of sexual relations
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.140]   where the difference between male and female
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.660]   is anatomically clearest, both men and women
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.480]   are seen as different kinds of vessels.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.620]   And you can see that meaning in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.880]   But the reason I say that's the root idea
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.240]   is because I don't think that's the present prominent idea
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.560]   in Peter's mind.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.480]   It doesn't really make much sense
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   to describe a woman's sexual organ as weaker than a man's.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.460]   What would that even mean?
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.180]   And what point would it have for their relationship?
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.700]   Rather, what we need to see is that the term vessel
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.680]   became, I think, rooted down there
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.480]   in that anatomical complementarity.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.720]   There grows out of it a generalized use
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.400]   of the word vessel for the human body.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.760]   The woman's body is a vessel,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   the man's body is a vessel in general.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.620]   And the reason I say that
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.080]   is because of 2 Corinthians 4.7,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.860]   where Paul, after referring to the preciousness
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.160]   of the glory of the gospel,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.700]   says we have this treasure in vessels.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.240]   So all Christians have this treasure of the gospel
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   in vessels of clay to show that the surpassing power
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.120]   belongs to God and not to us.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.140]   That doesn't mean that we have the gospel
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.720]   in our sexual organs.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   That's not the meaning.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.480]   It means we have the gospel in ourselves, in our bodies.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.960]   Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.740]   making the gospel powerful in our lives,
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.740]   and our bodies are fragile and prone to decay.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.420]   So I take the term vessel in 1 Peter 3.7
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.540]   to refer mainly to the woman's body.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.540]   Likewise, husbands live together
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.620]   according to knowledge with your wives
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.540]   as the weaker feminine vessel
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.540]   means live with one who has a weaker body.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.940]   That's the primary focus, I think.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.580]   Next comes the word feminine.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.660]   And the phrase is literally
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.320]   as with a weaker vessel, the feminine.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.980]   The point of that word is to draw attention
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.060]   to the fact that he really,
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.520]   Peter really is making a general statement
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.620]   about maleness and femaleness, or men and women,
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.940]   not just about the particular wife
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.580]   that you happen to be married to.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.780]   In other words, in Peter's mind,
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.780]   this is the real God-created world of male and female.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.260]   God designed men to have stronger bodies,
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.580]   and God designed women to have weaker bodies.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.880]   That's the plan.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.480]   That's God's purpose.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.160]   That's part of what feminine is in reality.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.880]   To be a woman means, with a few exceptions,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.660]   to be weaker than men.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.360]   It's not a fluke of nature.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.420]   It's not a random effect of natural selection or evolution.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.800]   It's the way God designed it to be.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.720]   And when you pause and think about that,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.960]   it should carry enormous implications, I think,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.580]   especially for Christian men,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.580]   which is why Peter draws explicit attention to it here
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.760]   and says, "Now, husbands, look, you know this.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.600]   You should live according to this knowledge.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   This is part of God's design for womanhood and for manhood.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.920]   She is the one with the weaker body.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.220]   Take that into account as a Christian
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.420]   when you contemplate honoring your wife."
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.160]   And then here's the last word to zero in on.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.660]   It's the one that Patricia was especially asking about,
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.260]   namely the word "weaker."
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.800]   And what we've seen is that the most immediate meaning
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   of "weaker" would be bodily weaker or physically weaker.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Now, we live in a culture that desperately wants
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.500]   for this not to be true and to find every way
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.920]   that it possibly can to obscure this truth
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.400]   and to avoid its implications
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.680]   for male and female relationships.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   So movie after movie and video after video
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   attempts to show women being as violent, as crude,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.840]   as able to neutralize male strength as any man can.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   Any thought that a woman might properly and joyfully
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.960]   look to a man for superior strengths
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   is sidelined or minimized or denied or mocked.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   So we live in a culture that is doing all it can
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.240]   to put its head in the sand
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.360]   and ignore what is palpably true.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.320]   Historically and universally, namely,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   men are in general stronger physically than women.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.880]   We are living a cultural contradiction
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.440]   because all of that cultural effort
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.800]   to deny the obvious is countered by the fact
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.860]   that in the Olympics,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.400]   no sport involves women competing with men.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.460]   In professional basketball,
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.080]   there's a league for men, a league for women.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.720]   In professional golf, there's an association for men
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.220]   and one for women.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.160]   In professional tennis, there's one for men
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   and one for women.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.400]   98% of the construction workers in America are men.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.480]   88% of police officers in America are men.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.360]   86% of military are men.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   And whatever sinful chauvinism may infect all of that,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.280]   none of those statistics are going to significantly change
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.840]   if all such sins could be taken away.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   These differences are rooted in God-designed nature,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.440]   not in sin.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.800]   Now, my guess is that Patricia is a very thoughtful woman.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   And when I say that weaker refers to bodily weaker,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.560]   weakness primarily,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   she will realize, given the nature of the modern world,
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.680]   that we know today that the body includes the brain
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.940]   and the hormonal system.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.940]   And the differences in these physical organs and systems
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.520]   produce differences in men and women,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.060]   not only in raw muscular capacities,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.120]   but in other ways as well.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.200]   All one has to do is type into Google,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.400]   you should try this,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.180]   what is the difference between male and female brains?
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.800]   Just type that into Google.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.640]   And you'll find dozens of scientific studies
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.280]   producing amazing discoveries in the last 20 years.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.040]   But we have to stop somewhere
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.920]   in dealing with this massive subject.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   So let me draw to a close.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   Let's focus on what Peter seems to regard as most central.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.000]   Peter is focusing on the way Christian husbands live with
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.400]   and honor their wives.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.680]   And he says, "Husbands, take into account,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.920]   keep this knowledge in your focus,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.360]   you carry as a Christian husband,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.800]   the responsibility and the burden
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.480]   of having the superior strength
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.160]   for the sake of protecting and providing
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.000]   and leading your wife through the threats
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.760]   and challenges of life,
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.640]   all the while realizing that at your side
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.500]   is a fellow heir of God,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.920]   a breathtakingly glorious human being
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.240]   who will shine like the sun in the kingdom of her father
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.680]   and who will not be married to you in the age to come
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.040]   because there's no marriage in the age to come,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.360]   but will stand before the King of Kings
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.220]   as his bright and glorious subject.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.220]   So mingle your caring, protecting, leading strength
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.560]   with a sense of wonder and awe
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   that you get to live temporarily with an heiress of God."
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.280]   - Amen, that's glorious.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that survey
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.580]   and for that reality, that glorious reality.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.680]   Thank you for the question, Patricia.

[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.520]   Well, when God tells Abraham and Sarah
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.400]   they will bear a child at ages 190 years old, respectively,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.000]   Abraham seems to laugh it off in unbelief.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.160]   Was it an act of unbelief?
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.400]   We're gonna look at the story more closely next time
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.000]   and the implications for our lives.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.160]   We'll see you back here on Monday
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.440]   when we look at, "Did Abraham Laugh God Off?"
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.280]   See you then.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
