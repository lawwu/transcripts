[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   How do we honor people around us who hold to false ideas about God?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.320]   The question is specific, but it opens a broader discussion I think is relevant for all of
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320]   us.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.720]   The question itself comes from a listener in Sri Lanka, a man who writes in, "Dear
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.400]   Pastor John, we Christians are a minority in a predominantly Buddhist country.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.640]   Bowing before a Buddhist priest with both hands folded is how the Buddhist clergy are
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.360]   greeted in our culture.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.560]   Buddhists themselves will often bow face down before the priests.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.480]   As Christians, some of us are uncomfortable with this.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.560]   We haven't found clear direction from Scripture here.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   Could you help us honor the Lord and His name in our land?"
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.560]   Well, I love getting questions from situations and relationships and places that are so different
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.000]   from my own.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   It helps me realize how provincial I am in some of the things I deal with, and yet how
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.400]   universal and relevant Christ and His Word are everywhere in the world.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.760]   It's a thrilling thing to me to think that somebody in Sri Lanka might think that a pastor
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.520]   sitting in a room in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 10,000 miles away, might have something from
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.280]   God's Word to say that would be useful in that culture.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.520]   That's just stunning to me, and I hope it is.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.440]   I consider myself a little presumptuous even to make any effort here, but if I can just
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.920]   stick close to God's Word, perhaps God would make it useful.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.480]   So the way I pose the question to myself is, "How can I honor—how can we—I'm thinking
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.560]   myself and this Christian in the same boat—how can we honor two kinds of teaching in the
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.040]   New Testament that together, no matter how much tension we may feel between them, should—both,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.160]   both of them—should shape our relationships with people in other religions, whether in
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.320]   America or in Sri Lanka, including the leaders of those religions?
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.440]   In this case, we're thinking about a Buddhist priest.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   So here are the two kinds of teaching I have in mind.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.520]   On the one hand, Peter tells us in 1 Peter 2:17, "Honor everyone.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Love the brotherhood.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   Fear God.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.900]   Honor the emperor."
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.120]   So there is a kind of honor that Christians show to everyone, simply because they're
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.840]   human, made in the image of God, and because they're potential brothers and sisters.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.440]   We would love it if they would be our brothers and sisters forever.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.120]   We would be delighted, and we should try to help them feel we would be delighted if you
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.600]   would join us in everlasting joy and submission to Jesus Christ.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.760]   Secondly, there's a special kind of love and affection and bond that exists between
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.880]   Christian brothers and sisters.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   And third, there's an absolutely unique kind of respect and reverence and submission
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   that we owe God, the Creator and Sustainer and Redeemer.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.440]   And fourth, there's a peculiar honor—same word is used at the end of that verse for
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.320]   honor the emperor—there's a peculiar honor that we pay for those whom God has put in
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.960]   civil authority over us as we are exiles and sojourners in the world.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   Now the Buddhist priests in Sri Lanka are not Christian brothers, so they're not in
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   that category.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.680]   They're not civil authorities, I presume.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.040]   I don't know my cultural story that well, but I'm assuming they are not in the role
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.160]   of governors and kings and princes.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.680]   They are, however, human.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.640]   And so there is a kind of honor or respect that Christians will show them, and I'll
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.500]   come back in a minute to try to flesh that out just a little bit.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.120]   So that's the first kind of teaching that we have in the New Testament—honor all people.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.920]   Here's the second kind of teaching.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.040]   It cautions us against three things.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.480]   The New Testament says we should not do or say anything that would cause immature or
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.000]   unstable Christian believers to stumble into doubt or unbelief or disobedience.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.300]   And I'm thinking of 1 Corinthians 8, 4-7.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.760]   As to the eating of food offered to idols, you could say, or the bowing before Buddhist
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.920]   priests, as to the bowing before Buddhist priests, we know that an idol or a Buddhist
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.860]   priest and what he represents has no real existence.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.960]   That is, what he stands for has no real existence, and there is no god but one.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.160]   However, not all possess this knowledge, but some, through former association with idols
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.680]   or with Buddhist temples and priests, eat food as really offered to an idol—that is,
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.360]   bow as really honoring what those priests stand for.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.420]   And their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:34.680]   So in that text, it seems to me, for the sake of such younger or immature or weaker believers,
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.000]   we who might have the freedom to pay a Buddhist priest some kind of respect and not intend
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.440]   anything religious by it, should probably avoid such public symbols of religious honor
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.040]   for the sake of the weaker brothers.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.400]   So that's one warning.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.720]   Here's the second warning.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.960]   The New Testament says we should not do things or say things or relate to people in a way
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.760]   that would blur the distinctions between Christ and his way of salvation, on the one hand,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.000]   and the teachings of other religions, on the other.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.060]   I'm thinking of 2 Corinthians 6, 14-18.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.100]   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship has light with darkness?
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.600]   What accord has Christ with Belial or with Buddha?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.760]   Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.860]   What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.840]   Therefore go out from their midst and be separate from them, says the Lord.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.900]   I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Almighty.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:52.900]   Now the point of those rhetorical questions seems to be that we shouldn't give the impression
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.540]   of having more in common with another religion than we really do.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.940]   So we need to find ways of distinguishing ourselves from the religion that we have come
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:14.260]   out of so as to make the differences clearer rather than blurry or obscure.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.500]   And here's the third warning that the New Testament gives.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:27.420]   Actually, the New Testament says positively that we do and say things that would make
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.180]   clear the unique and necessary gospel of the grace of God.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:39.420]   I'm thinking Acts 20-24 where Paul says, "I do not account my life of any value or as precious
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.660]   to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.480]   Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of God."
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.980]   So this is the great goal, to give and to speak—that is, to give testimony, to give
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:04.860]   clear evidence and to speak so as to make our witness to the gospel of the grace of
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.620]   God crystal clear, even if it costs us our lives.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.980]   So those are the two kinds of teaching in the New Testament that we need to follow.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:23.100]   The one stresses honor all persons, including Buddhist priests, and the other stresses that
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.460]   we need to maintain separation and distinction from our former religion.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:37.620]   So let me end by returning to what that honor of a Buddhist priest might look like.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:46.740]   Seems to me that there are probably in every culture ways to show respect for people as
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.660]   people but not for what they stand for.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.300]   Now that's a real challenge, but there's the challenge—respect for people as people
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.860]   but not for what they stand for.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:04.500]   That's the cultural challenge, not just in Sri Lanka, but right here in Minneapolis.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.580]   And I don't live in Sri Lanka, and I'm not sure exactly what that's going to look
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.820]   like there, but it would at least look something like this.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.220]   We don't act in a mean-spirited way.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:24.100]   We seek to avoid pride and self-exaltation.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:32.980]   We don't act in a way to shun a personal relationship as if we hold a person in contempt.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.300]   We seek to be outgoing in our testimony to the grace of God.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:46.540]   We stand ready to lay our lives down for the good of others, including others of different
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.000]   religions.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.780]   We stand ready to serve.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.140]   Paul talks about counting others more significant than ourselves, and I think he means by that
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:04.240]   stand ready to serve them, get down low, and do good things for them in the paths of love.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:12.940]   But we do not send signals—cultural signals, personal signals—that the difference between
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:21.900]   us is minor, or what the priest stands for in his religion is admirable or true or helpful
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.620]   when it's not.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.420]   It is, in fact, eternally destructive.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.700]   So there's the challenge.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.540]   One set of teachings, find a way to personally honor a priest who is created in the image
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:45.580]   of God in at least those ways, and find a way to communicate that we do not share these
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.580]   religious convictions with you.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.500]   That's good counsel for a difficult scenario, and one faced by all of us in various ways.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.620]   Thanks for the response, Pastor John, and thanks for the excellent question.

[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.460]   Well, the Apostle Paul is pretty clear.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.540]   Long hair on men is just plain wrong.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.180]   It's wrong because it violates nature.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.220]   But isn't nature why men can grow long hair in the first place?
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.460]   So how can Paul argue from nature against long hair on men?
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.380]   That's actually a really good question, and it's next time on Monday when we return.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.180]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
