[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Everything is loss without Christ, as John Piper made clear in his 2014 sermon
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   titled "Preparing to Know Christ Deeply Through Suffering."
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   There he addressed Philippians 3.8, where Paul says that we should count all things loss.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   So how do we do this? How do we count all things loss?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Jesus said, Luke 14.33, "No one of you can be my disciple who does not renounce all that he has."
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Period.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   No one, I'll say it again, this is Luke 14.33,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   "No one can be my disciple who does not renounce all his possessions."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Now you've got clothes on, probably got a car out in the snowy parking lot,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   might have an apartment or a house, and other possessions.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   You probably have an iPhone or pewter.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So you own things.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And this text says you can't be a follower of Jesus if you don't renounce those.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So you can check out different translations on that word.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Wouldn't that be the same as Paul saying, "Count them as loss."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So this is mine, right?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I think my wife bought it for me.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   This is mine. This coat isn't mine.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   This is my preaching coat.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And I should count this as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Jesus.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   What would that mean?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   What would that mean practically, to regard everything in your life as loss compared to Jesus?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   For the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'll give you four things that I think it means.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Because that's what you should be asking right now.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You say, "Okay, I hear the words. I hear the words.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I'm supposed to renounce everything I have, and I'm supposed to regard everything as loss.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I'm supposed to have this reversal of values.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Practically, I'm going to get in my car.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm going to eat the food in my fridge.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I'm going to put on my shoes and slippers.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Practically, what--these are just bullet points that you can think about.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   They're worth a chapter in a book.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It means that whatever I'm called upon to choose, whenever I'm called to choose,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   between anything and Christ, I choose Christ.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   If--it doesn't happen for everything in your life.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You don't have to choose between Christ and everything.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   But if you do, you have in your mind, "If I must choose between car and Christ, computer and Christ, wife and Christ, life and Christ,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   the steadfast love of the Lord is better than life, I choose Christ."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's the first thing it means.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's a resolution in your mind.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You have put in loss over everything in the sense that if you must choose, you choose Christ.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Number two, it means I will deal with all the things in the world.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I will deal with all the things in the world in a way that draws me nearer to Christ through them, or I won't deal.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   How you doing with videos?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Spending.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I regard everything as loss in comparison with Christ.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Number two, in the sense that as I wear my coat, drive my car, watch a video,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I will deal with this in a way that draws me more to Christ, not less to Christ.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   If the video undermines the pure, sweet fellowship with Jesus, rather than enhancing it, stop watching them.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm appalled at what Christians do for entertainment by taking it for granted that if it's in the theater, it should be watched.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I'm appalled, not because I'm a prude, that I have my favorite movies, but because I am ruined by certain scenes.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I won't watch certain good movies because of that scene.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I will not, because Christ is dishonored in my soul, and my mind is contaminated for months,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and He's more precious than the pleasure of the other 120 for minutes.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Come on, let's be Christian through and through. Let's get ready to suffer.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   We can't deny ourselves a little bit of entertainment that the world assumes we must have
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   in order for us to know and admire and sweetly and more deeply enjoy constant fellowship with our Jesus.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   How are we going to face the stampede of horses when they come?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That's number two. Use everything to enhance your enjoyment of Jesus, and if it doesn't enhance it, don't do it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Number three, it means that I always deal with things in the world in a way that shows the world they're not my treasure.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   How do you do that? Well, figure that out.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The world is watching you at work as to what is His treasure.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   There are ways. Read 1 Corinthians 7 on this, where Paul talks about doing business in the world
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and being married and other ways as though we were not. That's pretty provocative.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Be married as though you were not. Do business as though you were not doing it.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Buy things as though you had no possessions. This is crazy, wonderful Christianity.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Using a car, using a coat, using a computer in such a way that people around you assume that's not His treasure.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He uses it, and He has treasures, but that's not His treasure.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Number four, it means that I will lose any or all things that the world can offer without losing my joy.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   If by force or by circumstance or by choice any precious thing is ripped out of my hand,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   person or product, anything ripped out of my hand, it will not destroy my joy because Christ is my all.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Those are the four things I think it means to renounce all that you have, to count everything as loss,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   to experience this reversal that prepares you to suffer well.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Verse 8, "I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Beautiful. That was a clip from John Piper's 2014 sermon, "Preparing to Know Christ Deeply Through Suffering,"
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   sent in to us by Rebecca Payne in Chicago, which is where the sermon was originally delivered.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Thank you, Rebecca, for this clip. The full sermon, of course, is at DesiringGod.org.

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Tomorrow, Piper returns to tackle a perennially hard question.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   If God is sovereign over all sin, how can he still be good? It's a biggie.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
