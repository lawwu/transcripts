[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:42.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.760]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:58.040]   Yesterday on the show, I shared with you a little bit about our 2018 travel plans, which, in short, involve my loading up my family of me, my wife, our three young children and two dogs,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.520]   and traveling around the United States for an undetermined amount of time, probably something like six months, maybe shorter, maybe longer,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:17.120]   and taking an undetermined course so far that will involve beginning in Florida, winding up in the upper inland Northwest in the Mountain West to visit family,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.880]   and then at some point probably meandering back to Florida.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.720]   Now, whether that looks like a circle or a zigzag, who knows?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   But in many ways, I thought you would enjoy hearing a little bit of background of my path to this, speaking practically of how to actually make this happen with regard to the rig.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:48.400]   The rig, if you're not familiar, is what RVers love to call their vehicles, be it a motor home with a car on the back or a tow vehicle and a trailer.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   That's commonly affectionately referred to as the rig.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.920]   And RVers love to talk about the rig.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.080]   They love to think about the rig.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.240]   They love to plan about the rig.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.960]   They love to shop for new rigs.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.600]   I'm no exception.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.640]   But today, I'll share with you a little bit about what I've done and the successes I've had and the mistakes that I have made.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.000]   I will do this now prior to the start of the show, sorry, start of the trip, so that you can have this as an anchor point.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.720]   And then you'll be able to see in real time as I also learn how good my decisions were, what turned out to be wise, what turned out to be foolish, etc.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.040]   So a little teaser as we begin.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360]   I think I've made some good decisions along the way, but I've also made some bad decisions.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.480]   And in fact, I've lost a substantial amount of money, as is common with RVs.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.320]   That's a good place to start.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.200]   If you're going to get involved in the world of RVing, you should be prepared to lose money.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.760]   Because similar to boats, RVs are an excellent vacuum for all of your disposable money.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.360]   There is basically no limit as to how much money you could spend on RVs.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.960]   Doubt me, just go and look at a million-dollar motorhome.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   Go to a show or something like that.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.040]   You'll find them.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.760]   They're built on these giant bus chassis.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.800]   They got generators on them that can practically run a city block.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.880]   They are beautiful.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.280]   They're also a million bucks.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   Most people who own an RV quickly find that it can consume as much as you want it to consume.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   And so this is a very dangerous area of consumption because how do you get into it and make a decent decision and not lose your shirt?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.920]   You should be prepared mentally for that reality.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   Here's what I think is the common life cycle of an RV and most people's approach to RVing.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.480]   Many people will get excited about the idea of spending time in the great outdoors with their – usually children.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:04:00.880]   Or today, it's increasingly common that singles and couples without children are choosing whether – as young adults, which is growing massively, or as retirees, will choose to travel the country in full time, as they say, in their RV.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.240]   But what frequently happens is you'll find a young couple with young children that will get excited about the idea of spending time in the great outdoors with their children.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   All RV literature involves beautiful mountain scenes, beautiful beach scenes, and it's just the picture of tranquility.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.800]   And so many people get excited, go out and buy an RV.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.200]   Frequently, due to lack of knowledge, frequently people will start with a new one.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.120]   And then they'll use it a lot for a family vacation the first year.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.800]   They'll take it out in the summertime for a big three-week trip.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   They'll take it out perhaps on the Christmas vacation for a one- or two-week trip.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.480]   The next year, they'll repeat the same thing.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.880]   But then the third year, instead of having time to do the Christmas trip, they want to go and fly to see family at Christmas.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.400]   They leave the RV at home.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.640]   The fourth year, something else comes up during the summer.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.960]   One of the kids wants to go to summer camp instead of going on an RV trip.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.280]   And so instead of using it in the summer, then the RV sits at home.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.320]   And that year, it sits there all year.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.160]   And often by about the fourth or fifth or sixth year, the RV is used on average a week every couple or three years.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:11.760]   Well, frequently at this point in time, the RV has lost so much value and depreciation that the owners can't stand the idea of selling it and recognizing that loss.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.360]   After all, they may have just finished making the payments on it.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   And so it sits in the backyard during year six, year seven, year eight, year nine.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.600]   And they use it on occasion every now and then to take the kids out.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   But the kids are growing into high school and then they're graduating, moving off to college, and they don't want to spend time in the RV.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.880]   And it's not so fun for mom and dad without young children to really embrace it and enjoy it.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.800]   So they lend it out to a family member here and there.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   But basically, it just sits.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.000]   Finally, dad stops renewing the registration because it annoys him to pay the license plate every year.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.120]   It sits in the backyard for another two or three years.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.040]   And then finally, mom says, can we get that thing out of here?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   And finally, dad goes ahead and lists it on Craigslist or mom lists it on Facebook.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   And then you start selling it.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   And that's the case.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.520]   And so people lose a ton of money on RVs and don't use them.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.720]   That's what I think generally happens.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.840]   So you better watch out for that eventuality because you can lose a ton of money.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.960]   Now, I don't think it's necessary that you always lose a ton of money.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.640]   But I think you would be well advised to move slowly.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.680]   And I'll tell you a little bit of my successes because I've had some successes and some failures.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.280]   And hopefully, you can develop and build more successes in your life than failures.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:34.120]   First thing is move slowly and recognize that you are going to get into expensive territory quickly.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.280]   If you think that buying an RV will save you money, think again.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:48.520]   It will be cheaper for you to do your family vacations and pay for hotel bills than it will be for you to own an RV.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:58.840]   Unless you're actually going to be in the RV for an extended period of time such as six months, a year.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.320]   Other than that, the hotels are going to be cheaper.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.800]   Campgrounds are wonderful and you don't need an RV to appreciate them.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   So if you're going to get an RV, you should get it not because it sounds like fun,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   but because it fills a need that you've decided is important to you or I guess a want that wouldn't be a need.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.000]   It fulfills a want that you've decided is important to you.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.480]   For example, you enjoy fly fishing on the weekends and you love to go way back in the mountains and do fly fishing and photography.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.680]   And you don't enjoy sleeping in a tent on the ground.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.600]   Well, before you buy an RV, consider buying a cot.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.400]   But if you've decided you'd like to have some more comfort and you're going to buy a truck camper,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.600]   then make sure that it's getting you something that you can't get otherwise.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   There aren't many hotels in the backcountry and so that's a good use case scenario.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:01.160]   But if you're just thinking, "I'll load up my RV and we'll use that to travel across the country a thousand miles to go and visit grandma and grandpa,"
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.240]   friend, you're making a bad financial move. I promise you.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.640]   RVs are expensive to buy. They're expensive to own. They're expensive to drive. They're expensive to tow.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.400]   They're expensive all the way around.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   Now, a couple of thoughts in regards to your RV decisions.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.640]   And I'm going to tell you where I've made mistakes in the past so that I can –
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.520]   and I'm going to tell you some financial scenarios here today of how we have gotten ourselves set up to go full-time on the road.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.440]   But one of the first decisions that you have to make is, "Do I want something that I can drive
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.240]   or do I want something that I'm going to tow?"
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.600]   And of course, this is the great challenge. How do you decide?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   Driving your RV where you have access from the driver's seat to the actual coach is a wonderful luxury experience.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.040]   I can't think of many better ways to travel than in a big, comfortable RV
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.640]   where you and all your passengers have access to comfortable seats, big panoramic windows,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.280]   access to the kitchen, the refrigerator, the bathroom, all of those things without ever needing to stop.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.880]   That's a wonderful way to travel.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.680]   But it does come with some downsides, notably, of course, safety.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.400]   It's always a challenge to decide, "Should I go and sleep in the back while we're cruising down the road?"
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   That leads to a very wonderful nap, but it also could lead to bodily injury or death in the case of accident.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.680]   And one of the major things with problems with RVs is they are generally not crash-rated.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   Unlike automobiles where there are federally mandated crash safety ratings and tests, RVs are exempt.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.480]   Or like – I got mixed up on my words there.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   RVs are exempt from those ratings.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   And so basically an RV is a chassis, a metal chassis with a giant wooden box plastered over with a little bit of plastic or fiberglass.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.920]   And it has no structural safety rating.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.400]   You can practically run a motorcycle right through most RVs as far as through the walls.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.760]   So they're very unsafe if they actually get in an accident.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:21.000]   For me, however, especially with young children, I really wanted to have the experience of having a motorhome.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.280]   Motorhome is the word usually applied to a drivable RV where you have access to the amenities in the back from the driver and passenger seat.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.320]   And so the first RV that we bought was a 1993 Roadtrek camper van.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.920]   Now a Roadtrek camper van is what's called a Type B RV.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.480]   It's a very small RV, 19 feet long.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.200]   It's the standard length of a 15-passenger van.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.400]   And the reason that we chose this is because I believe there's a huge benefit of being small.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.320]   The smaller you can be when you own an RV, the better.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.160]   It is more efficient to drive, to tow.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.960]   It opens up more places to you.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.200]   When you're trying to drive a 45-foot bus, there just aren't that many places to park it.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.960]   But when you're driving a 19-foot van, you can park it anywhere.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.000]   And we chose that RV carefully because it had the amenities that we were looking for.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.680]   It had the beds that we were looking for.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.200]   It had the seats that we were looking for.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.240]   It was well-liked in the marketplace.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.280]   And I was really, really pleased with that purchase.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.840]   That particular purchase worked out really well.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.800]   I bought it in 2000 and I guess it would have been '16, '15?
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.520]   No.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.200]   Anyway, I bought it a few years ago.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.760]   I found it on Craigslist in Georgia.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.320]   It was owned by a single owner, elderly retired couple, which can be good but can be dangerous,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.200]   which I'll get to in a moment, the problems with RVs.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.040]   But I paid $7,000 for it.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.720]   Drove it back from Georgia to South Florida.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.480]   And total, during my time of ownership, I spent a total of $10,500 in it, including
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.000]   all the fees, a new set of tires all around, $1,000 on brand new Michelin tires all around,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.920]   fixing a couple things that were wrong with it, all the registration, et cetera.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.480]   I was in it for $10,500.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.920]   And all was said and done.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.280]   The problem with that vehicle was two things.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.240]   One, I did not calculate on where to put car seats at night.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.520]   And this was a major error on my behalf.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.240]   I had thought obsessively about the decision.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.120]   I thought I was making the very best decision possible.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   But although I had considered where to strap car seats during the daytime, I had not considered
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.720]   where to put car seats at night.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.800]   And when you have, at that time, two children and now three, when you have these giant,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   no other adjectives are necessary, these giant car seats, they are very frustrating to deal
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:47.960]   with.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.520]   And of course, they're important for your children, or at least so we are told by those
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.560]   who claim to know.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.040]   But they are very frustrating as far as where to put them.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.600]   And they take up so much room that we just decided, you know what?
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.800]   This isn't going to work.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.720]   I was able to sell out of that thing.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.000]   And I didn't lose my shirt.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   I sold it for a net of $10,000 when all was said and done.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.760]   So in my time of ownership, I was out of pocket $500 on the deal, which I was pretty happy
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.000]   with.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.560]   I had worked hard to put that deal together.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.480]   And I was pretty pleased with that.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.240]   To own an RV for-- I think I owned it for eight months, something like that, maybe 10
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:23.720]   months.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.120]   To own an RV, to use it-- we took some nice trips in it.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.240]   I enjoyed it.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.000]   And only lose $500 is not bad, in my opinion.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.040]   That gave us the benefit of having the access.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.360]   And that does lead, especially with small children, that does lead to a much better
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.600]   and easier traveling experience.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.960]   To be able to get the kids down, to use the bathroom, to be able to give them a snack,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   to be able to have access from the front to the back makes a big, big difference in terms
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.120]   of the joy of traveling.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.960]   However, in using it, what my wife and I realized was we could probably solve it a different
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.200]   way.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.400]   And when we decided that it was too small, given that we were adding a third child and
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.840]   we had no idea where to put the third car seat at night, we could have strapped the
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.280]   car seat in during the day, but we had no idea where to put it at night, we decided
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.640]   that we needed to go bigger.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.240]   And what I decided the best move was is to buy a full-size van and a travel trailer.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   Now, the benefits of a full-size van are a fewfold.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   One, there's plenty of places to strap car seats, of course.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.960]   You can strap car seats in and have plenty of room.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.920]   I also decided that if we just simply removed one of the seats in the full-size van, that
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.080]   leads to a fairly large cargo area.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   And that we could – which is actually in the traveling space.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.360]   And with that approach, we could actually bring in many of the benefits of an RV.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.080]   For example, it's easy to have a cooler with food in it that's readily accessible.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.840]   With a full-size van, there's enough room if I'm driving for my wife to get up and
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.880]   to help the children.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   You can bring a small toddler potty that is available to the children so you don't
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.760]   have to stop so frequently to use the bathroom facilities.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.320]   You get most of the benefits of an RV.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.400]   So that's a big benefit in my mind.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.600]   And we did that.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.200]   We ended up buying a 15-passenger van.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   And from the perspective of traveling, it worked just like I had imagined.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.320]   I bought a 2001 Chevy 15-passenger van.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.480]   We took out the front bench seat which led to a nice cargo area up front.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.880]   We had nice seats to strap the car seats into.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.440]   We could travel with a cooler, with a small potty.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.240]   It was really, really comfortable, really nice.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.640]   The other benefit of traveling with a van and/or other tow vehicle is you can have your
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.280]   driving space and your living space.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   So you don't have to convert either one of them.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.320]   If you have a tow vehicle and a trailer, all the car seats stay strapped in the tow vehicle
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.880]   all the time.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.440]   And then the trailer is just living space.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.320]   You don't have to have it cluttered up with all of the detritus of child traveling.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.280]   So that's a big, big benefit.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.520]   Now, the other reason that we've got a van is because I believe there's a real value
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.640]   in the world of vans.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   When you are deciding that you want to tow an RV, you have a few choices.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:13.400]   They come down to basically a fifth-wheel trailer, a travel trailer, or something else,
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.080]   which there's tons of options of something else.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.800]   A fifth-wheel trailer is that type of trailer where the actual hitch goes into the bed of
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.520]   a pickup truck.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.120]   They're big.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.280]   They have that large, bulbous front nose, and they go into the bed of a pickup truck.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.480]   Fifth-wheels are probably your best buy in the marketplace if you want to get maximum
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.960]   living space for minimum money.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.200]   Look at fifth-wheels.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.280]   Maximum living space, minimum money.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   You're probably going to go with a fifth-wheel.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:50.120]   And if you are willing to drive a pickup truck, then this fifth-wheel option is probably one
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.040]   of your best, most comfortable options to tow and to drive.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.880]   Fifth-wheel trailers tow really well.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.440]   They are more maneuverable.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.880]   They're just all around a really good option, a really good way to tow a trailer.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.240]   One of the downsides is many fifth-wheels are so incredibly large, they're just hard
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.880]   to deal with.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.280]   If you buy a 40-foot fifth-wheel trailer, that thing will not fit in the majority.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.640]   You won't get it into national parks.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.480]   You won't get it into most state parks.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.200]   Basically, you're going to be confined to an RV resort with pull-through campsites.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.280]   For some people, that's appropriate.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.800]   In my mind, that's not appropriate.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   I want to be nimble.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.960]   And so we set as our maximum desired length something about 30 feet.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.320]   If you're 30 feet or under, then you can pretty much get into most campgrounds.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.920]   Not all, but most campgrounds.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.600]   And you can get into many sites.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.280]   There will always be sites that you can't get into at most campgrounds.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.520]   But you can get into most.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.560]   You can find small fifth-wheel trailers.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:59.400]   So don't let a desire to have a small trailer dissuade you from shopping for fifth-wheels.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.200]   But they're harder to find than big, big ones.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   We didn't want a fifth-wheel.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.440]   And the reason I didn't want a fifth-wheel is I didn't want to get a pickup truck.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.760]   Pickup trucks, in my mind, are useful for some people.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.880]   But I didn't want to have one.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.200]   I say this as someone who now has one, which I'll explain.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.840]   Problems with pickup trucks is, number one, they're very limited seating.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.280]   About the biggest you can get from a factory is a crew cab with six seats.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.320]   We have three children, two dogs.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.720]   We don't fit all that well in a crew cab pickup truck.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.960]   And by getting a crew cab pickup truck, that automatically limits us to only being able to
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.560]   travel with our family.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.600]   That, in my mind, is not ideal.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:43.400]   And so I really wanted to have a big, full-size van with more seat capacity so we could travel
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.880]   with friends.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.320]   What's the point of having a camper if you can't load up three or four or five of your
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.400]   friends as well and go and use them?
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.000]   That's pretty much how I look at it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.920]   So I didn't want to have a pickup truck for that reason.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.600]   Another reason I want to have a pickup truck is pickup trucks are really not so useful
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.080]   from the capacity of load carrying.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.040]   I never understand this obsession among tradespeople with pickup trucks, to have these trucks that
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.760]   you've got to put all kinds of special boxes in to protect your tools.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.280]   They're inefficient.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.640]   They're poorly organized.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.960]   They don't do a good job of protecting your tools.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.880]   Most people are better off with a minivan, a full-size van, or an SUV.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.160]   So I didn't really want to own a pickup truck.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.320]   They just aren't very good.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.560]   And then the final thing is pickup trucks are expensive.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.480]   Because pickup trucks are in such high demand by men who want to drive them and look cool
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.840]   because they want to present the macho pickup image, they're very expensive.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.160]   It's hard to find a good deal, especially when you start looking at big pickup trucks.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.080]   Now, in my analysis, many of these problems were well-solved with a full-size van.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:52.200]   And I think the full-size van option is a really good way to get more for your money.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.960]   The full-size van gives the benefits of that comfortable traveling that I described.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.720]   Full-size vans have great cargo capacity, especially if you get the big 15-passenger
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.480]   one, great cargo capacity.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   And they're cheap.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.760]   There's not much of a demand for full-size vans.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.520]   If you were to go – let's say you have a large family.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.720]   If you were to go, you can buy a full-size – sorry, you can go and buy a minivan,
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.240]   a loaded-out minivan.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.520]   And you could load one out to be $40,000 to $45,000.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.040]   You can go and you can buy a full-size van and you can load it out as best you can.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.880]   And it'll come in below $35,000.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.560]   You can get them under $30,000.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.920]   Now, that's because they're more commercial in focus and so they're not going to have
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.200]   all of the amenities.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.320]   I still love minivans.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.360]   Minivans are wonderful.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.640]   And my wife refuses to drive a full-size van unless we actually needed one.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.400]   So we're in the world of minivans.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.560]   I think they are truly wonderful.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.640]   But especially if you want to tow, I think there's a real deal in the world of full-size
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.520]   vans.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.800]   Because traditionally full-size vans are built on a truck chassis, this makes them have
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.760]   poorer road manners than something like a minivan, which is built with unibody construction.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.960]   But they have towing capacity, rated as high as about 10,000 pounds.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   The highest one is the Chevy full-size vans.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.440]   Those are rated for 10,000 pounds.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.520]   The various iterations of the Ford vans, whether it's 12-passenger or 15-passenger, makes a
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.560]   big difference.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.040]   But those will get you in the range of 7,000 to 8,000 pounds, which is a sizable trailer.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.160]   The Nissan NV full-size vans are rated for up to almost 10,000 pounds.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.600]   Those are a good deal in the tow world.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   And then the various other more modern Euro-style vans have less towing capacity, but it's still
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.080]   decent.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.840]   You can get a great tow vehicle in a full-size van, and that was what I decided to do.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.320]   I wanted a Chevy for the heaviest towing capacity.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   And so I bought one.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.760]   I bought a 2001 Chevy.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.400]   Now, in the Chevy vans, there were three engine options that are available.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.000]   There are two gas engines, and -- or there were four engine options, but there were three
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.240]   that are rated for the highest with towing.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   There is an 8.1-liter V8, which is a giant 500-cubic-inch gas engine, which gets about
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.480]   13 miles per gallon whether you're driving empty or whether you're towing a trailer.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.680]   But it has a ton of power.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.760]   It's also very hard to find.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.680]   But I was looking for one.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.080]   I also was looking at a diesel.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.400]   And at those iterations of the Chevy vans, some of the older ones, they came with a 6.2-liter
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.720]   diesel, which was the old GM diesel.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.120]   Not super powerful, but adequate.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.720]   I was looking for one of those.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.120]   They also came with a 6-liter gas engine, which is the venerable Chevy 350 small block
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.280]   engine, which is one of the world's most popular engines and a good engine.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   They used to put it in the Corvette.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.040]   It's powerful.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.760]   The one that I wound up finding had the 6-liter gas engine.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.280]   And I felt like it would be sufficient -- sorry, the 5.7-liter gas engine, the 350.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.520]   So I felt like the 5.7 would be sufficient, and I was happy with the deal.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.480]   I found the van on Craigslist up in Gainesville.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.640]   The van was, all things considered, in really good shape.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.520]   There were some obvious cosmetic flaws, but it was in good shape, in nicer interior shape
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.360]   than many other vans of the similar vintage.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:11.160]   And vans of the age that I was looking at, which is a 2001, were probably worth in the
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.200]   marketplace around $3,000 to $3,500.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.480]   I was able to buy this particular one for $2,300.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.200]   So I was pretty happy with my deal.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.040]   And I was pretty happy that I had enough room that if it didn't work -- because my concern
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.000]   was if that engine, the 5.7-liter engine, couldn't pull the trailer that I was planning
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.640]   to get, then I needed to sell it out and not lose my shirt.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.800]   So at $2,300, I felt safe.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.920]   I felt I could at least turn around and sell this thing for $3,000, and I would be in good
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.560]   shape.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.760]   I did an extensive test drive on the vehicle.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.480]   I wound up having a long 45-minute test drive.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.960]   It had been owned by a transportation company.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.440]   And so all of the markers of it being a good deal were there.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.000]   It was in good mechanical shape, had 190,000 miles, but it had been cared for.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.760]   Most of those miles had come within the last year because it had been run -- owned by this
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.400]   transportation company that had run it constantly.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.680]   But it was in good shape, I thought.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.720]   And here's where we get into the problems of the mistake where I wound up losing my
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.220]   shirt.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.120]   I bought the van, and I drove it home, and it was fine.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:16.840]   It drove fine.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.040]   But it didn't have a ton of power.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.720]   So I took it to the mechanic, and the first thing we did was I said, "This van's going
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.120]   to be great."
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.520]   I had him fix a couple of cosmetic things that wanted to be done, some window latches.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.600]   And we had a good overall inspection.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.040]   I went ahead and started fixing things, fixed the brakes, fixed up a couple things that
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.480]   weren't strictly necessary.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.200]   Remember, I'm getting this thing ready to go across the country for six months.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   And so I needed it to be in good shape when I head out.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.720]   And I had the room.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.640]   I figured, "Okay, this will be a good vehicle."
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.040]   We took it on a couple of trips, just the van.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.320]   And then eventually, I bought the trailer.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.200]   And I found that this van basically couldn't pull this trailer.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.880]   I'll get to the trailer that we chose in a moment.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.480]   This marked a problem.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:13.400]   So I took the van to the mechanic, and we found out that the engine had significant
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.440]   power issues.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.440]   Here's a little tip for you that I learned.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.280]   Number one, as I'm sure you know, it's good for you to have a mechanical inspection if
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.680]   you're buying a used vehicle, especially if you're not a mechanic.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.240]   And I'm not.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.720]   I had promised myself that I'd always get a mechanical inspection when I bought a used
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.080]   vehicle a number of years ago when I made a bad deal on a car.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.760]   And yet on this one, I felt like I was okay.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.680]   I'd done an extensive test drive.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.000]   There were no obvious signs of problems.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.280]   The price was low enough.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.480]   I was pretty safe.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.440]   Worst thing that could happen is buy it for $2,300 and sell it for $1,000 scrap if it
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.520]   were truly scrap, which it wasn't.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.360]   So I felt pretty safe.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.600]   But what I learned is a little trick.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.120]   When you go to test drive a vehicle, one of the things that you need to do is turn the
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.080]   key on and look to see, before you start the vehicle, look to see if the check engine light
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.560]   comes on.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.680]   You want to see the check engine light come on when you turn the key on.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.080]   Then after you start the vehicle, you want to see the check engine light go off.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.920]   Now, I had neglected to bring my scanner with me to scan the engine for codes.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.200]   Rookie mistake.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.640]   And I didn't know this little trick.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.560]   Rookie mistake.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:37.560]   What I found out was many times when a vehicle is having consistent problems, an unethical
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.960]   person, an unethical seller, will remove the check engine light from the dashboard.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.120]   This means that it doesn't show up as being on, which means you don't know that the engine
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.240]   is throwing error codes.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.080]   And so I learned that the way that you avoid this is you need to see that thing come on
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.280]   when you turn the key on.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.520]   If it doesn't come on when you turn the key on, you know that there's a problem with the
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.560]   bulb or the light.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.640]   Now let's move to the trailer.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.680]   With regard to trailer, I mentioned there's fifth wheels and there are travel trailers.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.760]   Travel trailer is the type of trailer that hooks up to your bumper or to the hitch at
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.160]   the back.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.840]   And it's big and it's square, but it just hooks up down below.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.040]   And this works great with a van.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.960]   I think travel trailers, if you don't need maximum space, are your absolute best deal
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.240]   in terms of dollars.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.160]   They are so cheap.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.520]   Now they're cheap because they're mostly junk.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:36.360]   Most RVs, with a few exceptions of very high-end, well-made RV brands, most RVs are junk.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.360]   And you should just know that going in.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.880]   It's balsa wood stapled together with a little bit of fabric.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   They don't last.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.480]   They're not well-built.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.320]   They look shiny for a little bit so they can sell them quickly, but they're basically junk.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:56.200]   But if you can buy one with working equipment that'll at least hold together, it should
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.960]   do what you need it to.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   And in the used marketplace, the travel trailers are a great deal.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.600]   In my mind, the best deals come at about 10 years old.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.000]   Because if you think back to that common life cycle of an RV when people are buying them,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.440]   and you have a new owner that goes and gets one when their children are eight years old
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.200]   and six years old, well, they start looking to sell it when their children are 18 and
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.760]   16 after it sat in the backyard for a couple of years.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.720]   That's common.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.400]   That's basically the life cycle.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.760]   And by then, they've depreciated from about $30,000 new down to a lot less.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.600]   Now, for our family, we were looking for a bunkhouse model.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.960]   A bunkhouse model is – well, it's a model that has bunks in it.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.280]   And so there is a particular bunkhouse model that when you start looking at layouts, you'll
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.600]   find that RV layouts tend to be fairly standard.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.200]   There are only so many ways that you could fit in a few beds, a kitchen, a bathroom,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.480]   a table, and a couch.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.240]   There are only so many variations of this.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.320]   So they're pretty standardized at some point.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   We were looking for a bunkhouse model that has four bunks in the rear of the coach.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:05.160]   And that was what we – what was appropriate for us, so four bunks in the rear, bedroom
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.080]   up front, living area in the middle.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.520]   And we wanted something big enough that we'd be comfortable to live in for an extended
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.640]   period of time.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.880]   When you're buying an RV, you need to buy it for your intended application because it's
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.640]   all a study of tradeoffs.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.840]   If you have a giant RV, it can be so comfortable for you to fit in but you can't – sorry,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.600]   for you to live in but you can't fit it anywhere.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.680]   You can buy a tiny little pull-behind teardrop trailer or a tiny little trailer with a rooftop
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.240]   tent on it.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.720]   You can hook it up to your Jeep and go out in the mountains.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.160]   That you can get anywhere but it's not so comfortable to live in.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   And so everything is a matter of sacrifices.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.640]   You're just simply choosing what style of travel is important to you, which is why you
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.200]   should probably go slow and be very careful and not commit to a brand-new RV before you've
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.560]   actually tried something.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.000]   Some people think they need all the space and they recognize actually we're comfortable
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   with smaller space.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.200]   Some people think they're comfortable with smaller space and they wind up upgrading.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.320]   So it's frequent that RV buyers will have to go through a couple of rigs before they
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.080]   figure out what they actually want and what they're actually going to use.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.960]   In our case, we settled on about a 30-foot travel trailer.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:20.680]   It's the best number of compromises for what we were planning, which was an extended
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.120]   six-month trip around the country.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.480]   That gives you enough living space inside so that on multiple rainy days, you have a
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.160]   place for the children to play.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.560]   It gives you sleeping space where you can close off the children, you can close off
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.960]   the bedrooms and have a place for children to take naps inside in the air conditioning,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.600]   go to bed, enough of a space for mom and dad to actually be in the vehicle.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.280]   And when you're traveling for an extended period of time, it's a benefit to actually
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.880]   be able to be in the vehicle.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.320]   I'm going camping for a few weeks.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.880]   Anybody can go camping for a few weeks and can live outside in the elements, even dealing
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.760]   with bad weather.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   If you're on a short vacation trip and you get bad weather, you just change your plans
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.640]   and go book a hotel room or suck it up and embrace it as a character-building exercise.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.400]   But when you're living on the road for six months, that's tough.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:13.000]   And especially given that my intention is to work on the road, I felt like it'd be a
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.240]   mild form of spousal abuse to load up my wife with three small children and two dogs and
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   say, "Here, you hang out in this tent while I go and sit in an internet cafe and record
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.760]   radical personal finance."
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.360]   That seems like a mild form of spousal abuse and I don't think that would quite work.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.000]   So I wanted to make sure that we had a big enough vehicle.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.720]   And so I was shopping in this range of 30-foot bunkhouse travel trailers in about the 30-foot
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.040]   range.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.160]   In the choice of an RV, if you don't need all those things, consider going smaller.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.320]   Now, I mentioned there are basically three kinds of towable travel trailers.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.800]   There's fifth wheels, there's travel trailers, and then there's other.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:01.240]   There are a bazillion options of others, pop-up campers, A-frames, teardrops, all kinds of
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.440]   interesting iterations.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.360]   They're really neat.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.240]   And if you can get by with smaller, go with smaller.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.200]   But we decided to choose a larger travel trailer.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.360]   The first time I hooked up the travel trailer to the van, because I bought the van first,
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   I knew I had a problem.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.160]   Because the van was struggling.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:25.320]   First time I got it out on the open road after having some things fixed up on it, fixing
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.120]   up the brakes and the trailer controllers and all that, I knew we had a serious problem
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.800]   because I couldn't get the thing over 50 miles an hour on flat ground.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   That's a major problem when you're planning to drive over the mountains.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.720]   If you can't get it 50 miles an hour on the flat ground, I mean, that's 10-mile-an-hour
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.040]   stuff going up the mountains, which is just simply not safe and not fun.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   So we continued working on it, and we tried everything.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.840]   I tried-- we fixed all the stuff that needed to be fixed.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.560]   And still, end of the story, the van couldn't pull it.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.600]   And I sank a ton of money into that van.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.760]   Some of those things related to the inability to pull this big trailer.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.240]   It should have been pullable.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:13.080]   I don't fully know why it couldn't pull it, because we got the engine running through
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.320]   extensive-- replaced all the stuff, and the mechanic went through it and fixed it all.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.280]   Good mechanic, very knowledgeable, works with me on a lot of stuff.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.000]   We got it running as well as it could, but it still couldn't do it.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.400]   Now, I think it was probably partly a gearing issue.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.040]   The gears were too high to effectively pull the trailer.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.120]   Part of it was also that it was not-- when towing a trailer, it's not just weight.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.080]   It's also drag with how big the front of the trailer is, and this particular trailer is big.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.480]   It presents a lot of drag.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.320]   But the van, even after all the fixing, just wouldn't work.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.400]   And so I decided I had to change, and I decided to cut my losses, get rid of the van.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.040]   It's possible that if I'd swapped out the gears, or if I'd tuned up the-- if I'd added
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:04.120]   some aftermarket accessories to the engine, then we could have gotten it to work.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.840]   But I had already put so much money into it that I was really hurting and just wanted
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.880]   to cut my losses and run, decided that I didn't have any more stomach for it.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   So I made some serious mistakes with getting that van and fixing it up.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.680]   And the mistakes that I made was I didn't-- I started with some of the-- I assumed it
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.840]   would work based upon my research.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.720]   All of the numbers said it should have worked.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.280]   I knew my weight ratings.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.880]   I knew my tow ratings.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.840]   And on paper, it should have been fine.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.280]   But on paper is different than in real life.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.000]   So I made some mistakes.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.840]   I didn't catch the engine problems, which were the serious problems first.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:54.440]   And so I spent money fixing up the little things early that probably didn't have to
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.880]   be fixed so quickly.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.120]   Example is the window latches were messed up.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.120]   I bought it knowing that the window latches were broken.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.320]   I thought it would be an easy fix.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.600]   Well, it wound up actually costing a couple hundred dollars to have the window latches
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.840]   fixed up because I had another piece of metal.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.680]   And I just-- I thought it would be simpler than it was.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.520]   And so I had all those little things fixed first.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.680]   I was $2,300 in, $1,000 up front to have all the little things fixed because I thought
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.880]   this will work great.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.320]   Then we got into the trailer stuff.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.640]   And one of the things that I learned was that I wound up blowing out the trailer brake
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.480]   controller because there was a short on the trailer.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.360]   And we wound up putting another hundreds of dollars into the thing.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.800]   And then we got into the engine problems.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.160]   And it was another few thousand bucks.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.920]   But by the end of it, I was into the thing for over $6,000, somewhere-- I forget the
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.080]   exact number, but something like $6,500, which was a real problem.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.200]   When I went from, I was tickled pink with my deal originally.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.440]   I thought I was so brilliant.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.200]   I thought I had bought this great deal.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.160]   I had found my inefficient market.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.000]   I was so pleased with myself.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.560]   And now here I am woefully upside down, losing money and losing my job.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.760]   Upside down, losing money on a vehicle that would never get out of it again.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.240]   There was no-- and all those improvements were not the kind of improvements that were
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   actually going to work.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.720]   It gets you resale value.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.400]   Yes, they're valuable improvements.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.240]   But they're not the kind of improvements that get you resale value.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.160]   I thought through afresh, very seriously, whether or not it's the best course of action
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.360]   to buy at older vehicles when I dealt with this van.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.400]   I'll tell you how I came out of it in just a-- well, I'll tell you how I came of it
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.440]   now.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.640]   I decided to sell the van.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.680]   I was able to sell the van.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:38.040]   I sold it for $4,000, which means that I lost a couple thousand bucks on the van, which
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.400]   was very frustrating.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.840]   I hate to lose money.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.880]   But I was able to-- my market research was correct.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.760]   I made a bad decision with this particular vehicle.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.440]   But my market research was correct.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:55.320]   Because if I hadn't put all that money into it-- I bought it $2,300, sold it for $4,000--
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.480]   I was safe in the deal.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.560]   But I still wound up losing a couple thousand bucks.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:07.480]   I like to buy older vehicles because you don't lose so much money in depreciation.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:15.240]   Depreciation is, in many ways, unavoidable, especially when a vehicle is at its middle
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.320]   range of life, newer and middle range of life.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:23.960]   But when you get to older, cheaper vehicles, you wind up with depreciation being less of
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.520]   a factor.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.000]   The flip side is with older vehicles, you have mechanical problems that can suck up
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.560]   more money.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.720]   My observation and experience is that this is less of a problem than it once was.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:44.440]   If you were to go back 30 years and look and say, I've got this older vehicle.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.160]   Should I keep it?
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.440]   You probably shouldn't.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.680]   You probably would have been better served 30, 40 years ago to go buy a new car every
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.160]   10 years.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.320]   But today, there have been such dramatic improvements in manufacturing quality and in
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.240]   longevity of so many parts.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.680]   Cars are just better made.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.640]   And it's wonderful because I've had great experience with most of my older vehicles.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:14.680]   Very rarely do I have to budget for repairs that are not just normal maintenance items.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.800]   A new vehicle goes through tires just like an old vehicle goes through tires.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.840]   A new vehicle goes through brakes just like an old vehicle goes through brakes.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.280]   Those aren't the kind of repairs that were once so common.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.320]   Now, there are, of course, older things that do need to be fixed.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.120]   But I'd rather deal with a new starter here and there or a new alternator than know that
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.360]   I'm going to lose $3,000 this year on my $20,000 vehicle.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:43.560]   Depreciation is such a problem from a financial perspective that I think it's best to avoid
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.600]   it as much as possible.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.840]   Now, on this particular deal, I really question that because some of my problems would have
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.960]   been avoided on this van by just buying a newer vehicle.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.440]   Well, I still am not going to go and buy a brand new vehicle at this point.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.640]   But I do have to factor those in.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.880]   Simple things like the wiring on the van was all messed up.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.840]   And this wound up being an expensive fix that I didn't know.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.120]   The tail lights were working when I bought the van.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.640]   But the trailer brake controller wasn't working.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.040]   It was shorted out from the trailer.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.880]   And so we had to put in a new trailer brake controller.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.640]   But in doing that, we found out that the wiring in the back of the lights had all
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.680]   messed up.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:31.880]   And to undo that and bring it back to factory settings was a significant hassle and significant
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.380]   expense.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.600]   By the time you work through all that, that's a problem that an older vehicle had that a
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.640]   newer vehicle wouldn't.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:45.080]   So the lessons I learned, I still think I was right about the value of an older full-size
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.320]   van.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.800]   And I commend it to you if you're looking for a tow vehicle.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.280]   An old full-size van is good.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:50.840]   I was right.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.520]   If we'd had a smaller trailer, and I actually thought about getting rid of the trailer,
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.800]   buying a pop-up, went through all the variations, thought about buying just a smaller
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.000]   trailer, and wound up deciding no because we really liked the van.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.280]   The travel experience was great.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.000]   We decided no, we'll go ahead and swap out the tow vehicle.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.560]   I was right about those things on a full-size van.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.640]   I just wasn't careful enough in my buy.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.000]   Lesson learned.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.480]   Now about replacement.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.600]   What did I replace it with?
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.720]   I sold the vehicle and I decided to replace it with a pickup truck.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.280]   I don't like pickup trucks.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.320]   And it's not that I don't like them.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.520]   I think they're fun to drive.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.800]   I like to feel all big and tough when I drive a big pickup truck.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.360]   But practically speaking, it annoys me how inefficient they are and how unnecessary they
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.800]   are for most applications.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.560]   I'd rather use something that's a little bit more efficient.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.880]   But in this case, probably I was feeling a little bit burnt by my issues with the full-size
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.360]   van and I decided to go ahead and drop the plan of a van and go to a pickup truck.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.040]   I don't think that's necessary.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.640]   If I had been willing to upgrade my budget from under $5,000 to something in the range
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.400]   of $15,000, a great tow vehicle that's available is something like the full-size Chevy van
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.600]   with a Duramax diesel.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:07.400]   Chevy has very limited numbers of these, but you can find them in the used market.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.360]   You can get this full-size 15-passenger-size van with a Chevy Duramax diesel.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.400]   10,000 pounds of tow rating, powerful diesel engine.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.240]   It's detuned a tiny bit from the pickup trucks because of the less effective cooling that
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   you get with a van versus a pickup truck.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.880]   But it's very effective and a great tow vehicle.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.400]   I just wasn't willing to spend $15,000.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:33.080]   In general, it's my operating philosophy that I don't want to have more than about
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.680]   10% of my annual income tied up in stuff that loses value, which is all the toys of life,
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.560]   cars, boats, RVs, et cetera.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.360]   I really want to keep close to that 10% number.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.840]   Now, that's an arbitrary, hardcore, tightwad number.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.280]   50% number is perfectly fine.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.360]   If you can keep under 50% of your annual income in this stuff, I think it could be perfectly
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.520]   fine.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.840]   But I think the results, especially early in life, your financial results over your
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.560]   lifetime will be maximized if you keep that spending number very, very low.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:13.000]   If your annual income is $100,000 and you own only $10,000 of stuff that's losing in
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   depreciation, that means that you're losing only about, let's say, 15% a year.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.480]   You're losing only $1,500 a year in depreciation.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.720]   So follow my math.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:30.280]   You're earning $100,000 a year, but you only own about $10,000 of cars, boats, that kind
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.520]   of trailers, toys.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.880]   You're only losing $1,500 a year in depreciation.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:42.840]   If you earn $100,000 a year and you do what many people do, which is buy in excess of
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:48.520]   $100,000 worth of stuff, it would not be at all unusual for somebody with $100,000 annual
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:54.760]   income to have a $40,000 pickup truck, a $30,000 SUV, and a $30,000 travel trailer.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.440]   Well, in that case, if you're losing 15% per year, you're losing $15,000 per year in the
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.160]   value of your stuff.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.080]   It's hard to get ahead when you're losing $15,000 a year and an annual income of only
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.720]   $100,000.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:16.360]   So I like to keep things close to that 10% number to minimize the depreciation expense
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:16.920]   in my life.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.840]   And I've had pretty good success.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:25.640]   Frequently, in buying vehicles that are older, I've been able to get into a vehicle and get
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.160]   out of it with very little depreciation loss.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:37.720]   My first car, paid two grand for it, put 130,000 miles on it, sold it for $1,100 with not very
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.040]   many non-maintenance item mechanical repairs.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.280]   I just told you about the first RV that I owned.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.720]   $7,000 purchase price, $3,500 into it with all repairs, all improvements, got out of
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.280]   it at $10,000.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.840]   That really helps when you're in the early phases of your wealth-building career as a
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.480]   young person.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:00.200]   Down the road, once your wealth is more substantial, you can start to make different choices
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.160]   without harming things.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.560]   But early on, you've got to be very, very careful with this stuff.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.240]   So what about the world of pickup trucks?
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.880]   Recognizing that I'm trying to shop in the lower end of the market, but I'm trying to
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.240]   find something that'll do the job, we face a challenge.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.840]   The great thing is there are lots of large pickup trucks available, especially in the
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.240]   United States.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.880]   There are so many big pickup trucks available, you can find a deal.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.280]   Let me walk through some of the constraints.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.040]   First, I need a crew cab.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.680]   This automatically limits the number of vehicles that are available.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.840]   Still an abundant population, but because I need a crew cab, I can't get quite as good
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.400]   of a deal.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.160]   If you just needed something that was capable of towing a travel trailer and you can get
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.200]   by with an extended cab, you can get deals left and right.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.240]   So I needed a crew cab.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.440]   Number two is the question that comes down to what kind of engine, gas or diesel.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.480]   In the past, I think this was a no-brainer in terms of diesel.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.320]   If you were to go back 15 years, diesel cost less than gasoline.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.440]   Diesel engines lasted longer than gasoline.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.000]   Diesel engines were not that much more expensive to buy than gasoline.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.360]   And so in short, this was basically a no-brainer.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.440]   Today, I think all of that is different.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.480]   Today, based upon the improved fuel standards that happened about 10 years ago, where now
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:24.280]   in the United States, it can only sell ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, because of these changes
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.600]   in fuel standards, diesel generally costs more than regular gasoline.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:36.760]   Diesels get slightly better fuel mileage than gas engines, but it's not as big of a change
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.240]   as it used to be, especially when you start to factor in the higher fuel costs of diesel.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   Diesels do get better gas mileage, but not substantially so.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.840]   With regard to power generation, the power generation of diesels has gone through the
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.920]   roof. From every one of the three major manufacturers in the United States, you can buy a
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.240]   diesel engine that would basically put out 1,000 pounds of torque.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.720]   That's double, more than double what you would get 15 years ago.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.560]   And that's tremendous.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.840]   The tow ratings have gone from maximum of 10, 12, 15,000 pounds to 35, 37,000 pounds,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.760]   I think, with the Ram, something like that.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.640]   It's huge numbers.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.400]   But so is gasoline engines.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.320]   And gasoline engines are much cheaper to buy than a diesel engine.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.680]   They weigh less, so you get greater cargo capacity, which could be helpful if you're
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.120]   planning on something like a truck camper.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.280]   And most people just simply aren't going to put the numbers on a diesel engine
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:35.160]   of miles where you actually need the longevity of a diesel engine.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.280]   Most gasoline engines, I'm convinced, really can go a million miles just like older diesel
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:40.920]   engines can.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:47.560]   Toyota did a campaign with one of their 5.7 liter gas engines of a guy who worked in
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.920]   Louisiana delivering parts to the oil industry.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.800]   And he put a million miles on the thing over the course of seven or eight years.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.480]   And it was perfectly adequate.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   In my family, we've put, let's see, 330,000 miles on one gasoline engine on the car before
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.560]   it was sold, but 330,000 miles on another gasoline engine.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.320]   So I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with a gasoline engine that's maintained
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.640]   why it can't have the longevity that a diesel engine is known for.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:23.000]   As far as operating costs, diesel engines have had a huge jump in operating costs, especially
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.960]   in the modern era for a couple of reasons.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.680]   One, diesels simply cost more because they're bigger and more powerful.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.920]   Diesel engines are always going to have two batteries instead of one.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.400]   When you replace one battery, you've got to replace two generally.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.600]   Diesel engines are going to hold more oil than gasoline engines do.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.960]   Now, with the modern emission standards, now you have an entirely separate set of fluids
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:52.280]   for the diesel exhaust fluid, which is urea that goes in the scrubber in the exhaust system
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.560]   to clean the thing out.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.480]   And because of all these increased emission standards, in order to meet the emission standards,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.600]   diesel engines now cost thousands and thousands of dollars more.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:09.240]   If you get under a modern 2017, 2018 Super Duty or 2018 Chevy, the exhaust system on
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.320]   the thing, if you have to replace it, it's going to be three to four grand.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.560]   It's really tough to consider wanting to own one of those things when it's out of warranty.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:21.960]   So the point of this is to give those of you who've considered this analysis the idea that
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:27.720]   I think that you can get by in most situations and are better off in most situations buying
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.560]   a gas engine in a pickup truck.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:38.520]   Unless you need to tow a heavy trailer over the mountains all the time.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.560]   If you're a weekend warrior, you can tow a heavy trailer over the mountains with a gas
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:43.880]   engine.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   But if you're going to tow a heavy trailer over the mountains all the time, you're going
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.840]   to want a diesel.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.720]   That's where the diesel really does shine.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.960]   Or if you're going to put a bazillion miles on the thing, you want a diesel for pooling.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.200]   And so finally, in this case, I said, you know what?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.080]   That's what I'm going to be doing with the diesel engine is I'm going to be pulling a
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.000]   heavy trailer over the mountains all the time.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.240]   I'll go ahead and buy a diesel.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.760]   I'll look for a diesel.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:15.640]   One of the benefits of diesel is because it's well liked in the marketplace among normal
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   people.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.160]   I don't think it should be as well liked as it is, but that doesn't matter.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.040]   It doesn't matter what I think.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.320]   What matters is what the market says.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:27.640]   They are expensive to buy, but they do hold their value, which means that although you
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.600]   may pay more, you're probably not going to lose as much.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.880]   Gasoline engines are great because you can buy them cheap, but they're not going to keep
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.160]   their value like a diesel does, at least in today's market.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.400]   So let's talk about the diesel marketplace.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.680]   And I'm getting very granular here, but I hope it just shows you my method of analysis.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.720]   I needed a crew cab.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.320]   That was requirement.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.720]   In looking at the crew cabs among the – and I needed towing capacity, which rules out
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   all light and medium duty trucks.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.720]   I need a heavy duty three-quarter ton or one ton vehicle.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.800]   In looking at the crew cabs, I wrote off all of the older Dodge crew cabs because they
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.600]   had this weird tiny little crew cab where it was a four-door crew cab, but the back
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.200]   seat was very, very small.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.040]   And I need space for my dogs.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   So I – although the Cummins, I enjoy driving the Cummins.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.920]   It's a great vehicle.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.320]   It's well loved, very long-lived.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.240]   For my purposes, I needed the bigger cab.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.040]   Now Dodge came out with bigger cabs.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:31.160]   Today, they have the normal size crew cab and they have this massive quad cab, which
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.400]   is super comfortable and I'd love to own one.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.800]   But I didn't – it wasn't in the price range that I wanted to spend.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.360]   I didn't want to spend 15 to 20 grand on a pickup truck.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.680]   I wanted to spend something like five to eight.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.880]   So given that range, I couldn't find a Dodge.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.920]   I wrote off Dodge, which leaves Chevy and Ford.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.440]   Now Chevy, since they came out with the Duramax diesel, has done a pretty good job.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.760]   It's a good engine and a good vehicle to buy.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.680]   It's relatively simple.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.400]   They dumped their old 6.2-liter GM diesel.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.200]   They brought in the Duramax diesel, the Allison transmission.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.080]   This is a good option for towing, well-liked, pretty reliable, pretty good.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.160]   There aren't as many on the road as there are Fords, but they're pretty good.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.320]   When you look at Fords, you run into an interesting situation.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.600]   I'll get a little bit into the weeds because this should tell you how you need to shop,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:22.920]   I think.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:29.480]   You have the older Fords, mid-'90s and later, the old-style, more boxy Fords.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:36.440]   These older diesel Fords had a 7.3-liter diesel engine in them, which was a very solid engine.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.520]   But there are a couple of problems with these older ones.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:43.240]   Number one, the old diesel engine had a mechanical fuel pump, which really didn't produce that much
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:43.560]   power.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.160]   So although it was a good engine and long-lived, it didn't produce that much power.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.840]   Which, in my situation, I decided I needed some bigger power.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.240]   The other problem with these older Fords is that parts are becoming scarce.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.400]   Frequently, if you need to buy a wiring harness, you got electrical problems.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.200]   It's hard to find.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.440]   So they are, in my mind, not a good buy.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:11.080]   They're expensive to buy because they have this well-loved 7.3-liter diesel,
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.960]   but it's not much value.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.440]   So I wrote off the pre-'99 Fords.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.800]   In '99, Ford redesigned their truck, and they came out with the Super Duty series.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.600]   And they came out with a series of diesel engines.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.760]   Ford has, since 1999, they started with a 7.3-liter diesel.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.440]   Then they moved to a 6-liter, a 6.4, and now there's a 6.7.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:39.480]   6.7 seems to be a fairly well-designed engine, but it's too new for me to buy at the price
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.760]   that I wanted to spend.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:47.000]   The 6.4 was a terrible engine, basically, which basically people bought a diesel that
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.920]   wound up being only 100,000-mile diesel.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:54.200]   And if you drive a 6.4, get rid of it, because all of the mechanical indications seem to
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   be the thing is just a ticking time bomb.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.720]   Very expensive to fix.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.400]   They're not a good engine.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.120]   So I didn't want a 6.4, which left two other engines, the 6.0 and the 7.3.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.760]   Now here's where I'll get a little bit nitty-gritty.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   The post-99.73, I think it was from '99 to '03, was more powerful than the pre-'99
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.280]   because they worked out some – they swapped out the fuel pump system.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:20.600]   And that other engine can be built up and it can be – have the power increased.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.760]   The stock form should be fine for most people, but the power can be increased pretty easily
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.880]   with some aftermarket work.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.840]   I mean, you put propane and nitrous into it, you can get it to 1,000 pounds of torque and
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.920]   still have pretty decent longevity with it if you want to run it with propane and nitrous.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.600]   And you can get there simpler.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.200]   You can get to 500 a lot simpler.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:45.160]   The problem with the 7.3s is they are big, they're loud, and they're well-loved.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.680]   So they cost a lot of money in the secondary market.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.920]   They were advertised from the factory basically as a million-mile motor and everyone knows
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.240]   that.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.320]   And so they're very much desired.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.440]   In – what was it, '04, I think?
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.240]   Ford swapped out the 7.3 with a new 6.0-liter diesel.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.920]   They did this so that they could start to meet the new emission standards for diesels.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.840]   One of the biggest problems with the 7.3 is it pollutes like you wouldn't believe.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.080]   It is so dirty of an engine.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.480]   It's just – it's very dirty.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.120]   And so they had to improve on that.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.560]   And so Ford released a 6-liter diesel engine.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.240]   It's a good engine, but they rushed it to market.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:31.080]   And especially in the early years, they missed a number of important design flaws without
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.240]   getting into the specifics of it and the studs and the bolts and all that.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.680]   They made some problems.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.160]   And the 6.0s started to have serious problems.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.080]   You could find them and you could fix them.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:49.960]   Today, all of those problems with the 6-liter are basically known and are fixable.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.840]   But it's hard to know what you're getting into.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.840]   And so because of this, when you start shopping 6-liters, you'll find that frequently they're
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.240]   cheaper.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.720]   And they're cheaper because people don't want them.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.880]   I think there is a potential buy opportunity here.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:12.520]   If you're willing to spend something in the range of 15 grand on a diesel pickup truck,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:19.240]   I think there's a good buy option to buy an older 6-liter, something like an '04 or an '05,
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.440]   and to make sure to have it properly bulletproofed.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.760]   And I think you get a good truck.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:30.040]   You get more modern suspension components than the older early 2000s Ford.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.760]   You get more modern suspension components.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.200]   But you do away with a lot of the problems of the later ones where you don't have to
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.240]   deal with the emission systems.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.680]   You don't have to deal with the 6.4 and the 6.7 on all the emission systems that cost
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.560]   so much money.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.160]   You don't have to deal with that.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:48.200]   You just have a good, more modern diesel engine that does a good job, has great power ratings.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.640]   And if you can fix those things, I think that there is an opportunity there.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.800]   I didn't want to spend that much money on a diesel truck.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.880]   So I was back shopping in the 7.3.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:04.440]   So to wrap this saga up, I decided to buy a 7.3 crew cab.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   Beyond that, I was relatively ambivalent about whatever other options.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.680]   My preference would be crew cab long bed.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.680]   My theory is if you're going to drive an 18-foot vehicle, why not drive a 20-foot vehicle?
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.880]   It really doesn't make that much of a difference, but I'd rather have the extra cargo capacity.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.160]   And two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, didn't really care.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.520]   I just definitely don't want something that's been lifted or has been done that,
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.800]   because that ruins your longevity when people lift the trucks.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.600]   So I really wanted something that would be – as long as it had a 7.3-liter diesel,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.320]   was in good mechanical shape and a crew cab, I was happy.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.280]   I wound up finding one.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:44.440]   I found a – it was a 2000 F-250 crew cab, two-wheel drive.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.320]   It was family-owned throughout its entire history.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.120]   Had it inspected, and I'm happy with it.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.080]   It wound up being a two-wheel drive, which I'm happy with.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   It lowers the cost from a four-wheel drive.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.280]   I don't need four-wheel drive.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:01.000]   It'll hurt the resale a little bit because many people do want the four-wheel drive,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   but I bought it cheaper anyway, and it saves – it's cheaper to operate a two-wheel drive.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.440]   One less axle to fill with oil, one less transfer case to deal with,
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.600]   better fuel economy because it's two-wheel drive.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.080]   You don't have the drag of the four-wheel drive system, et cetera.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.520]   And actually, higher towing and cargo ratings because of the less weight of a two-wheel drive
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.020]   truck.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.680]   So I got the truck.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.200]   The truck does fine.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.960]   I towed it up to the trailer.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.240]   I've got the trailer, a 30-foot travel trailer with a bunkhouse.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.120]   One note I forgot to say is when you're shopping for trailers,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.640]   one of the things I think you want to stay away from is you want to avoid
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.200]   buying a trailer that has not been recently used.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:44.120]   One of the biggest problems that novice RV buyers face is they buy an older trailer,
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.960]   and they say, "Oh, it hasn't been used, and so it'll be great."
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:55.240]   The problem is RVs, like boats and like cars, if they're not used, they rot.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.120]   All the little rubber bits rot.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.960]   All the little plastic bits rot.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.520]   They rot.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.480]   And those are the things that are expensive to fix.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.680]   Better to buy one that's been used than one that hasn't been used recently.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.760]   Now, you don't want to buy one that's been abused, but you do want one that's used.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.040]   And so when I was shopping the RV marketplace, I found tons of these things.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.160]   But you look at the tag.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.720]   The tag hasn't been registered in three years.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   The tires clearly haven't moved.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.880]   And you've got so many maintenance items to get the thing just roadworthy,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.640]   repacking the bearings, fixing all the stuff, new tires all around, et cetera.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.360]   And that doesn't involve even getting into the appliances, which in an RV are
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.720]   really what you're buying.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.720]   The body is relatively insignificant if you're buying older RVs.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.880]   Yes, you want to watch out for body problems and rotting roofs and rotting floors.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.840]   But in many ways, those things are not going to be as big of a deal.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.960]   But if your refrigerator doesn't work because it sat there and hasn't been used for the
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.680]   last four years, you've got a problem.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:59.560]   So I'm sharing these numbers to tell you just simply that you don't have to spend $50,000
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.040]   on a rig.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:07.080]   I think total, if I add up the new diesel truck and the trailer, I'm into this thing
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:12.040]   for, what, $15,000 between the two of them, something like that, $15,000, $16,000 between
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:12.600]   the two of them.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:20.760]   It's likely that I will lose some money when I sell, which of course, you can't-- I don't
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.000]   think.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.240]   You can always hope to make money on every deal.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.640]   I know some people who can make money on every deal.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:30.600]   But I haven't chosen to dedicate the time to that at this point.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.680]   But I'm into the whole thing for about $15,000.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:37.560]   I think we've got a solid, serviceable, reliable rig that should get us around the country
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.840]   for six months.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:44.120]   Both of the vehicles are near terminal value, where it's hard to imagine them going a lot
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:44.360]   lower.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:48.120]   The RV could lose a couple thousand bucks in value if my kids beat it up and it just
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.920]   becomes ugly.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.000]   The truck could lose another thousand, couple thousand bucks in value if I put a lot of
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.120]   miles on it.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.960]   But we should be good.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.080]   I think we'll be good.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.200]   Now, the big unknowns, of course, are going to be if we wind up finding some unexpected
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.760]   expensive repairs-- new transmission on the road, break an axle on the trailer.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.680]   I broke an axle on one of my trailers one time.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.960]   That was a pain.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.480]   It's things like that that are really unknown.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.840]   But we'll see.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.320]   That's the saga of the RV trip.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.760]   That's the saga of it.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.520]   I will share with you along the way.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.640]   If I make more mistakes, I'll let you know.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.320]   I'll let you know what those mistakes were.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.400]   If I did a good job with analysis, you can listen to this here, and you'll see what you
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.280]   find down the road.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.480]   But that is the story of putting together a truck and a trailer with the goal of going
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.600]   around the United States for an extended trip for about six months, maybe more, maybe less.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.320]   Since I haven't done a trip like this before, that's the best I can hope for.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.240]   You do, as with most things in life, you do your very best to prepare.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   You do as much research as you know how to do.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.400]   And then you pull the trigger.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.280]   Sometimes you win.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.080]   Sometimes you learn.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.760]   But sitting still doesn't help.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.960]   Hope to see you out on the road.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.240]   Listen to yesterday's show, if you haven't, about all the things I'd love to hear from
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:07.640]   you.
