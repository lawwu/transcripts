[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the last phrase in the fourteenth
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:20.520]   verse of the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 1, and to the phrase
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.040]   "unto the praise of his glory".
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.480]   Now obviously that connects with what has been going before, so I will start reading
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.660]   at the beginning of verse thirty.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.880]   In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation;
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.480]   in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.240]   is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.280]   the praise of his glory.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.400]   We consider this morning that final phrase.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.040]   We must stop at this and consider it.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   I am almost tempted to ask a question.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800]   There are many present, most indeed present probably, who have been attending regularly
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.360]   as we have thus been working our way through this tremendous introduction to this great
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.640]   epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.320]   Many were present last Sunday morning when we looked at that statement about the Holy
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.580]   Spirit being the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.640]   The question I am tempted to ask is how many expected that this morning we would be going
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.400]   on to verse fifteen and that we had finished with verse fourteen, that we had indeed finished
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.640]   with this entire great introductory statement.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.200]   But we haven't.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.720]   The apostle does not stop at the words "purchased possession."
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.000]   He adds this, "unto the praise of his glory."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.520]   And this is no mere addition.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.720]   This is no mere idle addition.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.600]   The apostle does not throw in these words as it were just to make a statement appear
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.500]   to be complete from the literary standpoint.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.000]   This phrase is an essential part of the apostle's teaching.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   It is as much a part of his teaching as all that we have been considering about the sealing
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.440]   of the Spirit and about the earnest of the Spirit.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.400]   Indeed you notice that the apostle has already used this selfsame phrase.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.800]   He has used this phrase before in verse six, where he says, "to the praise of the glory
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   of his grace."
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.200]   He has done it again in verse twelve, "that we should be to the praise of his glory who
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.360]   first trusted in Christ."
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.460]   And here it is once more.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.760]   You can divide up this great statement into three sections, the section ending at verse
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.080]   six, the section ending at verse twelve, and the section that ends here at verse fourteen.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   The important thing for us to observe is that the apostle ends each one of the sections
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.920]   on precisely the same note.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.880]   He is not content merely with making his statements.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.240]   He must add this to it.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.280]   It is all to the praise of the glory of God's grace.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.240]   And therefore we cannot pass on to verse fifteen—indeed it would be very wrong of us to do so—without
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.280]   giving the due weight and importance to this statement, which the apostle obviously intended.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.440]   Because here, in this last phrase, he reaches again one of his climaxes.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.800]   He brings us up to the point which he regards as being most important.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.960]   Now, it would not be a bad thing for us this morning just to look in general once more
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.600]   at this tremendous statement which we have been considering at our leisure, beginning
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.520]   at verse three and going on to the end of this verse fourteen.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   For those who are interested in statistics, this is incidentally the twenty-seventh Sunday
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.400]   morning that we have been looking at these first fourteen verses of this epistle.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.040]   Now, you notice that certain things stand out very prominently.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.200]   One of them is the way in which the apostle ends each section with this phrase about the
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.000]   praise of his glory, or the glory of his grace.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.640]   The other striking thing is, of course, the constant reference to our Lord and Saviour
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.680]   Jesus Christ.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.000]   In these fourteen verses, the apostle makes fifteen references to the Lord.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.200]   Or, if you like to consider it in terms of the twelve verses from verse three to the
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.680]   end of verse fourteen, he refers to him twelve times.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.160]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.240]   And on he goes, repeating the name, bringing us back to it.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.360]   You remember how in the tenth verse we emphasized that, that in the dispensation of the fullness
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.800]   of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.400]   and which are in earth, even in him.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.320]   First all, always everywhere, in him.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   In other words, the apostle cannot deal with these matters without always being conscious
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   of two things.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.200]   One is the Lord Jesus Christ, and the other is the glory of God the Father.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.480]   Now it may be an idle thing to do, to compare these things and to ask which of these two
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.640]   should come first, which of them should have priority.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.800]   There is a sense in which that is a foolish question.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.480]   There is another sense in which it is a very important question.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.680]   And if one is to come before the other, the one that comes first is this, the praise of
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   his glory, the glory of God, the glory of the Father.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.760]   Now we read together just now that great seventeenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.080]   in order that we might remind ourselves of that fact and how that was the supreme thing
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.800]   in the mind and the consciousness and all the life and ministry of our blessed Lord
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.740]   and Saviour himself.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.200]   It was the thing about which he was always concerned.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.220]   It was the dominating motive of his life.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.240]   He had come to glorify God, to glorify his Father.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.880]   And nothing, he desired more than to be glorified himself in turn by the Father and that he
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.080]   might go back to share the glory which he had shared and enjoyed with him before the
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   foundation of the world.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.960]   Very well then, I say all this by way of introduction, a kind of apologia, if you like, not apology,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.240]   but apologia, for asking you to pause with me for a moment and not to rush on to verse
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   15.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:45.440]   Every single statement in this tremendous assertion of the Apostle is of supreme significance.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.880]   And indeed we cannot have enjoyed truly all that he's been stating in this massive assertion
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:02.400]   unless we see it all in the light of this final phrase, "To the praise of his glory."
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   Very well then, let us pause and look at this and let me try to help our thinking by putting
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.040]   it in the form of some two or three propositions.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.920]   The first is this.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.080]   The glory of God must be the starting point of all our thought and it must always be the
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.480]   test of all our thinking.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.520]   Here I say is the place that we must begin.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:38.200]   The entire realm of our thought must always start from this.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:44.760]   And our particular thinking about any particular doctrine must always be estimated and assessed
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:54.400]   finally in terms of its relationship to this controlling, covering conception of the glory
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   of God.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:03.840]   Now, I don't know what you feel, my good friends, but more and more I have a feeling
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.080]   that this is perhaps the point of all points at which we tend to fail most lamentably at
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   this present hour.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.760]   And here, obviously, I am not speaking of the world, I am speaking of the Church, I
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.280]   am speaking of Christian people.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.600]   There is nothing perhaps of which we are more guilty than this.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   I think I have told you before of the shock I received some twenty-five years ago when
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.720]   I picked up a book which had rather a striking and arresting title.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.240]   The title was "Religion without God."
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.640]   And I said to myself, "What does this mean?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.880]   You can't have religion without God."
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.920]   But of course the man was able to prove very easily and very clearly in his book not only
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.200]   that you can have religion without God, but that indeed much religion, if not most religion,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.120]   is often entirely without God.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.240]   In other words, people tend to assume God.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   They take God for granted.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.360]   They are so busy with their religion often that God is quite forgotten and really doesn't
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.280]   enter into their thought and into their conceptions.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   And I think many of us would be rather amazed and surprised if we stopped to analyze ourselves
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.840]   in the light of this.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.680]   And if we asked ourselves, strange and alarming though it may sound, "Where does God come
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.560]   into our life and into our thinking?"
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:46.760]   Obviously, if we are wrong at this point, we are going to be wrong everywhere else.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.680]   Now let me give you some illustrations to show you this terrible danger.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.320]   The point I am trying to make is that all our thinking must be governed by our conception
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:05.040]   of the glory of God, and that if the glory of God does not enter into our every particular
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.600]   doctrine, every idea and every thought that we have, well then that thought and that doctrine
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.320]   is quite defective.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.080]   Now let me take an illustration at random.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.400]   Let's imagine, for instance, that we began to have a discussion about the doctrine of
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   sin.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   Let's imagine that somebody propounded this question for discussion, "What is sin?"
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.640]   There's a lot of talk about sin, but what do we mean exactly by sin?
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.800]   So I imagine that large numbers of people who are Christians would say, and would confine
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:47.480]   themselves entirely to this, they would say that, well, sin of course means certain actions,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:56.240]   certain sins of which we are guilty, certain things which we do which are wrong, certain
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.880]   things which we feel condemned for after we have done them, certain things which get us
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.360]   down, and certain things which make us miserable afterwards, and about which we feel that we
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.760]   wished we hadn't done them.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.960]   Now am I being unfair when I suggest that, speaking generally, that would probably be
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.800]   the answer that we should get if we asked, "What do you mean by sin?"
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.440]   We tend to think of sin in terms of sins, actions, things we do, and things from which
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.240]   we suffer consequences.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.040]   In other words, our tendency is to think of sin entirely in terms of our sins, our own
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.880]   actions and our own reactions.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   But that's not the biblical view of sin.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   What is sin?
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:54.440]   Well, sin is this, the essence of sin, is not to give unto God the glory that is due
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.600]   unto his holy name.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.640]   That's sin.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.360]   And if that doesn't come into our conception and our definition of sin, well then I suggest
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.080]   our whole view of sin is entirely inadequate, is indeed even dangerous.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.720]   Because you see, there are men and women out in the world who don't believe in God at
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.200]   all, who in a sense can have said everything that we tend to say.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.720]   They know that they do things they shouldn't do.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.760]   They've got their moral codes and their moral standards.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.200]   They know what it is to suffer from remorse and to suffer the consequences of certain
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   actions.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.480]   And the human sense is full of that kind of thing.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.920]   So that isn't what makes sin, sin.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.720]   The essence of sin is a wrong relationship to God.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   Now we are reminded of that in that first question of the shorter catechism drawn up
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.380]   by the Westminster Assembly three hundred years ago.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:58.080]   It tells us that the chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.440]   So you see, sin essentially is not to glorify God.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.480]   Now I'm simply asking an obvious question, and yet I think you'll agree with me that
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.680]   it needs to be asked.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.520]   How often do we remind ourselves that that is the meaning of sin?
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:26.200]   And how often when we're on our knees, even in the presence of God, do we remind ourselves
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.040]   that the real trouble about our lives is not so much that we haven't lived the life we
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.880]   should have lived or kept up to the standard or that we've broken our pledges and vows,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.840]   but that we've been failing to glorify him.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.960]   How often do we ask him in words to forgive us for that?
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.000]   No, I think we must all plead guilty.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.400]   We forget the glory of God.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.120]   We are so self-centred and self-concerned that the most vital thing of all is entirely
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   left out.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:04.080]   So our thinking at that point is not controlled by this fundamental conception.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.840]   And that is why you see, so many of us perhaps thought that we'd finished with verse fourteen,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.640]   we need to stop to the praise of his glory, the great thing is the redemption of the purchased
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.160]   possession and so on.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.760]   No, no.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.160]   We must never stop without arriving back at that point.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.200]   You start with God, you come down into the world and all its problems, and you go back
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.120]   into God, and you're not complete until you've arrived there.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.740]   Well, now there's one illustration, but take another.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.520]   What is our idea of salvation?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.560]   How do we define Christian salvation?
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.000]   How do we give an account of it?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.980]   How do we give our testimony?
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.720]   I think again you will find that very generally people talk of salvation once more in terms
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:00.160]   of themselves and of certain benefits that they've derived, certain experiences they've
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.120]   had, certain happiness that has come into their life, how everything is now different
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.200]   with them.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   And they stop at that.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:14.680]   Thank God that all those things are perfectly true and are essential parts of salvation.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.440]   But surely if we stop at that, we are missing the greatest and the most wonderful thing
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.180]   of all in salvation itself.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:30.260]   The great thing about salvation is that it restores men to a right relationship to God.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   You go back and read even in the Gospels, the preaching, the early preaching, John the
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.180]   Baptist calls people to repentance.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.180]   Why?
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.660]   Well, because they're in a wrong relationship to God.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.820]   Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ does exactly the same thing.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.460]   The thing they urge people to do is to escape from the wrath to come.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.460]   It isn't to get put right in this respect or that or to feel happier or better.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.580]   The wrath of God is upon them.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.580]   Escape, they say.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:07.300]   In other words, you see, the whole preaching here is in terms of the glory of God.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.260]   And the Apostle Paul, in bidding farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus, you
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.020]   remember, he sums up his whole ministry to them.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.620]   He says, "Let me remind you that I was with you."
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.260]   He is preaching to you day and night and going about from house to house with weeping and
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.820]   tears and he says, "You remember my message?
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:31.380]   It was this, repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.100]   What is the message of salvation?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:40.860]   It is this, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.100]   You see, it is always in terms of God.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.140]   And so I could take you through every single Christian doctrine.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.660]   We might consider the doctrine of man this morning and we would have to come to the same
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.660]   point.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.380]   No definition of man, no idea of man is correct and adequate unless it is in terms of the
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.660]   glory of God.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.060]   And so on, we could go through the entire gamut of Christian doctrine and I could show
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:14.140]   you in each particular case that unless it always comes back to this, it is somewhere
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.300]   or another defective and it will eventually lead to confusion and to error and the last
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.940]   state will be worse than the first.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:28.860]   So you see the importance of pausing at this praise, "Unto the praise of his glory."
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.020]   That is the prime object of salvation.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.260]   My dear friends, whatever may happen to you and to me, whatever our moods and states and
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:46.080]   feelings, the supreme object of Christian salvation is to glorify God.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.180]   But the particular thing that the Apostle is emphasizing here and to which I call your
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:58.860]   attention is this, that you and I are to live to the glory of God.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:05.340]   And that all that happens to us as Christians is designed to promote and to proclaim the
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.820]   glory of God.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.780]   And that is why you see at every single pause he comes to, at every single section, he is
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.780]   bound to say it.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.660]   He has been describing in the first section the predestination and calling of God and
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.980]   it is all he says to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.060]   In the second section, his emphasis has been especially upon the work of the Son and that
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:32.180]   God's great purpose in this dispensation is to bring together, to reunite in one all
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.820]   things, both which are in heaven and on earth, even in him.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.340]   And then he comes to this particular theme that we have been looking at the last few
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.580]   weeks, how the Jew and the Gentile are being brought together.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.620]   "We first," says Paul, "that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   in Christ."
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.060]   "It first came to us who are Jews," says the Apostle.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.980]   The gospel first came to us and some of us have believed it and we are to the praise
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.700]   of the glory of his grace.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.540]   But you also, in whom you also trusted, and what is the object of it all?
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:12.660]   Well, it is still the same, to the praise of his glory.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.620]   Christian Jews are to the praise of his glory.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.620]   Gentile Christians are to the praise of his glory.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.260]   All together are to the praise of his glory.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:29.060]   Well, now then, let's try and see exactly what this means.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.700]   You remember that astounding phrase that we read together in that tenth verse of the seventeenth
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.700]   chapter of John's gospel at the beginning, where our blessed Lord, praying to his Father,
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.660]   says, "And I am glorified in them."
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.220]   He says that he had glorified the Father and now these people whom he leaves behind in
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.700]   the world when he goes back to the Father are to glorify him.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.900]   That's our calling.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.180]   That's a description of us as Christian people.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.820]   We are to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.860]   How do we do so?
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.460]   We are to be the praise to the praise of his glory.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.100]   Well, I suggest in two main ways.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:17.700]   The first is the one I've already been mentioning, of which now I want to deal with in detail,
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:27.340]   that our view of salvation should always be such that it is to the praise of his glory.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.540]   Now I ask again, therefore, what is our view of salvation?
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.220]   Is it something small?
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   Is it something easy?
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:46.300]   Or is it something that produces in us a sense of wonder, love, and of praise?
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.020]   As we think of salvation this morning, our own salvation, Christian salvation, is it
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:58.380]   such that immediately and of necessity it ministers to the glory of God?
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:04.100]   Have we, I say, a large view of it or is it a small view?
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.980]   Well, let us divide it up and put it like this.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:15.420]   A true view of salvation is to the praise of God's glory for this reason, that we
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:25.180]   see at once that it is something which is entirely and altogether of God, to the praise
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.340]   of his glory.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.100]   So the way you measure your view of salvation is the amount of glory that is ascribed to
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:37.420]   God in your view.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.820]   How much of it do you claim is due to yourself?
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.340]   How much of it do you think you are responsible for?
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.180]   Now, the extent to which you come in and what you do and what you think and your effort
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.220]   and your striving and your activity, to that extent you are detracting from the glory of
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.700]   God.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.820]   A view of salvation which is to the praise of the glory of God is a view that ascribes
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.460]   the entirety of salvation to him, and the Apostle, of course, has been doing that in
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.940]   this very section.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.780]   He starts off by saying, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.900]   hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:28.740]   Then he starts off, "According as he hath chosen us in him," and so on and so forth.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:35.100]   Do we realize that we are what we are this morning, Christian people, solely and entirely
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:45.140]   and exclusively because of the grace of God?
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.260]   I repeat my question, where do you come in?
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.880]   Do you insist upon a kind of partnership?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.220]   Is it a kind of synergism, or is it only the action of God?
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.220]   You cannot avoid this inevitable position.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.860]   To give God the glory, you must give him all the glory.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.260]   His is the glory alone, and there is none in man.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.180]   Now that is the great theme of all these New Testament epistles.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.020]   Remember how the Apostle puts it in a very striking phrase at the end of that first chapter
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.420]   of the epistle to the Corinthians?
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.780]   He says, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.580]   and sanctification and redemption."
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:37.940]   That, in order that, "According as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.260]   in the Lord."
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.020]   Why is salvation such as it is?
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.140]   Well, he answers the question.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.380]   He says that no man should burst.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.260]   And any vestige of bursting or taking credit to ourselves is a detracting from the glory
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.260]   of God.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.340]   It is God and God alone.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.580]   He is the beginning and the end of salvation, the author and the finisher in Christ.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.540]   It is entirely his.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.660]   But not only that, let us go on to a second thought.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:22.340]   Our idea of salvation is to the praise of God's glory.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:30.100]   If we have a large view of the whole idea of salvation—oh, how prone we are to think
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:36.540]   of it, I say, in subjective terms and to forget that the whole conception of salvation is
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.220]   the biggest and the greatest thing that the world has ever known.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.820]   There it was in that tenth verse, which we have already dealt with, that in the dispensation
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.340]   of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.660]   which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.900]   What a gigantic thing it is!
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:04.100]   Formed, fashioned, thought out, planned in that eternal council between Father, Son,
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.460]   and Holy Spirit, planned perfectly, being put into operation, and going on to that ultimate
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.340]   climax, the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.180]   How often do we think of it like that?
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.700]   How often do we stand back and look at it?
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.700]   How often do we take a glimpse of the panorama of salvation?
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.500]   Oh, my dear friends, it is because we forget to do this that we do not live to the praise
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.500]   of his glory.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.500]   Oh, our ideas are so small, they are so self-centered, they are so subjective.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:47.780]   Let us get out of them, I say, let us go up into the hills of God and view the landscape,
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:54.620]   oh, this mighty plan, this glorious scheme of salvation as originally thought in the
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.060]   mind of God and as it is being put into execution.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:05.180]   The greatness of it is merely an idea.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:10.060]   But think for a moment of its greatness in execution.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:17.180]   We are taking a general view of all this this morning as we end this great section.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.460]   Think of the greatness of salvation, I say, in its execution.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.980]   Is there anything that so reveals the glory of God as this?
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.940]   How often do we stop to remind ourselves that man's sin, that the fall, created a problem
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.300]   even in the eternal mind?
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.660]   That sin is not something small that can easily be covered over and dealt with.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.820]   There are so many people who think of it like that, don't they?
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.860]   Oh, they say sin, well, yes, of course, we admit it, but the love of God, it is all right.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.460]   But it isn't all right.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.940]   And if you dismiss it like that, you haven't seen the greatness of Christian salvation,
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.300]   you know nothing about the glory of God.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:04.060]   This is where I see the glory of God, that the man in his folly rebelled against him
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.660]   and brought catastrophe upon himself.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:15.660]   God instead of turning his back upon him, looked upon him with a piteous eye.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.180]   And the problem was discussed and the son stepped forward, if I may use an anthropomorphism,
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.620]   the son stepped forward and said, "Here am I, send me."
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.620]   Where?
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:34.020]   Into that land of sin and woe, into that rebellious humanity, into that world defaced and smothered
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.140]   and spoiled and marred and ruined by iniquity.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.180]   "Here am I, send me."
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.540]   And the father sent him.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:50.700]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.140]   You see, when you begin to think of these things, you are ministering to the praise
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.140]   of his glory.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:00.900]   Yes, it involved that, the sacrifice of the son, the father's heart, the father's love,
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.460]   allowing him to come, sending him indeed.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:14.140]   And who can conceive of what happened in the incarnation?
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.580]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.740]   He left behind himself the signs of his eternal glory.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.260]   He did not consider his equality of God something to be clutched at and to be held on to.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.420]   He laid it aside.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.980]   And he was born as a babe.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.940]   Oh, you know the story.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.340]   But my friends, we don't remember it often.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.340]   We don't look at it again.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340]   We don't consider it.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.460]   With Isaac Watts, we don't survey it.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.380]   We are so concerned about ourselves.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.580]   Our view of salvation is so small.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.380]   Stand back and say, "Look at it, the praise of his glory."
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:55.380]   Down he came in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the form of a servant.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:02.140]   Yeah, he humbled himself even to the death of the cross, the shame of it all.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.740]   But he did it, I say.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.820]   And God laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.940]   We are going to remind ourselves of that.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   That's what happened there.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.700]   It isn't that Christ on the cross just forgives the people who condemned him to death.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.700]   No, no.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:23.940]   It's the Father making him to be sin for us, punishing sin, striking him, wounding
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:31.020]   him, yea, killing him, that you and I might be forgiven.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.380]   That's the glory of God.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.220]   Yes, he died.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.940]   He was buried in a grave.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:45.540]   But thank God he arose, delivered for our offenses, raised again for our justification,
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.540]   ascended unto God.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.620]   And on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit sent down in order to apply all these benefits
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.620]   to us.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.140]   That's the view of salvation that glorifies God.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   And you see what happens.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.940]   It's happened here in this section.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:08.380]   Salvation is as great as this, that the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity have taken
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.620]   an active part in it.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.180]   It isn't merely the love of God.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.180]   No, no.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   It is the love of God.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.460]   But it's the love of God sending the Son and the incarnation and all that followed.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.940]   The Son has been active and the blessed Holy Spirit is active.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:28.860]   You'll find it in this section, verses 3 to 6, mainly the Father, verses 7 to the end
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.580]   of 12, mainly the Son, verses 13 and 14, the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:40.180]   Your salvation and mine involves the whole Trinity.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.340]   And it's only as we remember that we are living to the praise of his glory.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.820]   But let me hasten on to something else.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.060]   I am still dealing with this subject of our views of salvation.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:56.900]   The next way in which we glorify God by our view of salvation is this, is that we see
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:03.660]   the perfection of God's plan of salvation in meeting our exact condition and our every
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.580]   need just as it is.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:17.020]   Choosing, electing, predestinating.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.380]   When we were dead in trespasses and sins, quickly, you see, it's always God.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.540]   And whatever our condition, he meets us exactly where we were.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.980]   As the result of the fall of Adam, as the result of original sin, we are all dead in
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.580]   trespasses and sins.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.300]   We have no spiritual life.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.860]   The things of God are foolishness unto us.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:42.340]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.900]   The natural mind is enmity against God.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.820]   How can such a being be saved?
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.500]   There is only one answer.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.780]   He must be quickened.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.060]   He must be given new life.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.120]   He must be given new understanding.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.020]   He must be given the gift of faith.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.940]   And his every need is supplied exactly where he is.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:06.020]   It's all in this great epistle.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.820]   And on it goes.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.740]   Every state and condition we enter into is dealt with.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.020]   We are given not only this gift of belief and of faith, we are then given assurance,
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:24.460]   the sealing of the Spirit, and then the earnest, the foretaste, the first fruits that we were
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.860]   dealing with last Sunday.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.340]   It's all here.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:35.260]   The comfort we need, the help and the strength, the power, everything provided.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.340]   What a perfect plan of salvation it is.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:48.220]   God stooping to our weakness, mighty as he is, and giving us precisely what we need at
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.620]   every stage, at every step, and at every point.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.140]   It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.420]   I know of nothing more glorious this morning than to know whatever may be true of me, that
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.780]   I am in the hands of the great Potter, and that he is fashioning me and moulding me.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.060]   Yes, he reprimands me.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.900]   Things come across my path I don't like and I am humbled, but thank God I know that
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.460]   it's a part of the process.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.460]   I know I need it.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.300]   There are angles that need to be rubbed off and to be removed.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.060]   He is fashioning me according to the image of his Son.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.620]   It's a glorious thing.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.140]   Is there anything more glorious than to know and to feel that you are in the hands of God
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.140]   and that we are his workmanship?
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   That's it.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.500]   It's all to the praise of his glory.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:45.020]   And then lastly, think of its certainty.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:51.020]   If you are not certain about it all, well, you are detracting from the glory of God.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.180]   But the apostle has just been emphasising this.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.180]   He says that God has sealed us for himself.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.020]   He has put his mark on us.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.220]   No man shall be able to pluck them out of my hands.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.900]   The seal is on us.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.740]   It's in our foreheads.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.980]   And heaven and hell cannot rob us out of the hands of God.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.700]   Nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.700]   Lord.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:26.460]   Oh yes, we are sealed until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.140]   It's absolutely certain.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:34.580]   He which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:41.300]   You know, my friends, a view of salvation which implies that man's failure can spoil
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.020]   God's scheme doesn't glorify God.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.700]   An idea of salvation which glorifies God is one which says it's absolutely certain because
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.580]   it's God's and that nothing and no one can ever upset it or frustrate it.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.140]   And that's the biblical teaching.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.220]   It's all to the glory of God.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.980]   He starts it, he ends it.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.140]   The foundation of God standeth strong.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:12.540]   Having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:18.420]   Does our view of salvation minister to the praise of his glory?
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.300]   Oh, my friends, let us test our views by this.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.180]   Unless all our thinking is to the praise of his glory, it's wrong.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.580]   We are detracting from it, it's sin.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.860]   All the glory must be his and none ours.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.820]   And then the second thing, I merely give you my heading.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:46.740]   We are meant to be to the praise of his glory, not only in our thinking about salvation,
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:53.580]   but we ourselves in everything are to be the praise of his glory.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.860]   I say in everything.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.220]   You and I should be such people that in all we do and say and all our thinking and all
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:06.100]   our activities, we should be ministering to the glory of God.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.980]   And when people meet us, they should be made to think of God and his glory.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:18.140]   You and I are meant to be such people that the only explanation of us is God.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.100]   That's what it means to glorify God.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.620]   Oh, our Lord has said it once and forever, hasn't he said, "Let your light so shine
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:34.460]   before men that they may see your good works, but glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.140]   So much of our activity as Christians today doesn't do that.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.860]   People see us and they stop by looking at us.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]   It isn't to be like that.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:47.140]   Let them see your good works, but glorify your Father which is in heaven, which means
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.420]   this, that they look at us and they say, "Now that's extraordinary.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   That's marvelous.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.420]   That's wonderful.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   What is it?"
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.420]   "No man, no man, no man."
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.420]   No, no, that's God.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:04.340]   They glorify God and as they see us, that is the result that should eventuate.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:11.540]   But I'd rather want to close by putting it like this.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   Our experience even should be to the praise of his glory.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.900]   I mean something like this.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:30.340]   You and I can be Christians and yet we may not minister much to the glory of God.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.700]   There are some Christians who seem to spend the whole of their lives in this world bound
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.060]   in shallows and in miseries.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.060]   They're always in trouble.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   They've always got problems.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.980]   They're always unhappy and if they sin, the whole question of whether they're saved or
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.060]   not seems to rise always and there they are, miserable and unhappy.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.740]   And yes, there is such a thing as a miserable Christian, alas.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.960]   But that isn't to the praise of God's glory, is it?
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.660]   What is to the praise of God's glory?
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.060]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.780]   It is to be assured of your salvation.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.420]   It is to be rejoicing in Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.900]   It is to have great joy.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.620]   It is to enjoy the Christian life.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.340]   It is to enjoy the practice of holiness.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.220]   It is to enjoy reading the Scripture.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.300]   It is to enjoy prayer.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.260]   Nothing glorifies God more than that because man by nature cannot do that and he doesn't
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:33.460]   do that.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:40.780]   But when you see a Christian who is independent of circumstance and chance, who with the Apostle
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:47.460]   Paul can say, "I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.220]   I know both how to be abased and how to abound.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.980]   I am full."
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.780]   Such a man is to the praise of God's glory.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:04.460]   Yes, in experience, or let me ask my question before we leave this glorious section.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.420]   Have you been sealed by the Holy Spirit?
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:13.700]   Does the Holy Spirit testify with your spirit that you are a child of God?
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.540]   Are you rejoicing in it?
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.020]   Do you love God?
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.380]   Are you enjoying the life of God?
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380]   These are the questions.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.940]   That's the way to glorify God.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.340]   That's what all the saints have always done.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.140]   Nothing glorifies Him more than that.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.940]   And then the other thing is obvious, isn't it?
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:33.540]   In our lives, in our conduct, and in our behavior.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:39.020]   I rather like the way the Apostle puts it in writing to Titus.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.900]   He says there that the business of Christians is to adorn the doctrine.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.540]   What a statement!
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.980]   The doctrine, as it were, is the suit.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   And then what do I do?
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.580]   Well, I adorn it.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:58.660]   I just add certain attractive pieces, the final bit of sinker of color, adorning the
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   doctrine.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.700]   That's how I am to live.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   The doctrine is there.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.620]   We've been going through it in detail.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:10.500]   Now my life is to be an adornment to that doctrine.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.620]   Or take the way in which he puts it in writing to the Philippians.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:23.660]   Only let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.860]   It must become it.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.980]   In other words, it must match it.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.460]   You know how often people are defective in that respect.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.300]   There may be a clash of colors.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.020]   The hat may not match the costume or whatever it is.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.020]   There's a clash.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.020]   It isn't becoming.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.660]   And it doesn't suit the person, an old person dressing like a young person, or vice versa.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.660]   It isn't becoming.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.100]   Now, says the Apostle, that's how you are to live as Christians.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:57.740]   Only let your conversation, your conduct be as becometh the gospel of Christ.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.660]   In other words, you and I are to live in a manner that is becoming of a doctrine that
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:07.740]   tells us that God sent forth his own Son, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.540]   That the Son of God left heaven and was born as a babe and died for me and for my sins.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.780]   I'm to live in a manner becoming of that.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.460]   That's the New Testament way of preaching holiness, you see.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.980]   Not a gift to be received, but a conduct, a life that is becoming and in accord with
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.300]   such a glorious doctrine.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.140]   Well, my friends, we must leave it.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   It's an endless theme.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.420]   It should be with us Sunday by Sunday.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.260]   It should be with us day by day.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.860]   Whatever branch we're considering, whatever aspect, practical, doctrinal, it doesn't
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   matter.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:52.820]   All, everything is to the praise of his glory.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.220]   Glory be to God the Father.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.020]   Glory be to God the Son.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.540]   Glory be to God the Spirit.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.860]   Great Jehovah, three in one.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:18.820]   Glory, glory, while eternal ages run.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.860]   Amen.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.780]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
