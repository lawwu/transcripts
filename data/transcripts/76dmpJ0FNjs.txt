[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.900]   He's a financial historian.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900]   And to say that Dick Sella is a financial historian
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.900]   is kind of like saying that Steph Curry shoots hoops, okay?
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.620]   He is, I think, commonly recognized,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.020]   universally recognized as the dean
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.700]   of American financial historians.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.900]   He is the author of A History of Interest Rates,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.660]   which is on everybody's shelf who does finance.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.500]   And I am just tickled to have Dick here with me.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.940]   We heard earlier today a very elegant description
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.060]   of the mathematics of personal finance.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.780]   You know, return, volatility, risk aversion,
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.980]   and how you plug that into an asset allocation.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.980]   And I like to say that investing is half mathematics
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.740]   and half Shakespeare.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.380]   So you heard an hour and a half ago
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.660]   a very eloquent exposition of the mathematics.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.320]   But without the Shakespeare, the history,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.300]   and the psychology that feeds into it,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.880]   you are dead in the water.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.540]   So without further ado,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.940]   I'm going to ask Dick a rather offbeat question,
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.700]   which is, when I checked into the hotel the other day,
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.860]   the clerk took one look at me and said,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.020]   "Yes, you get room 1929."
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.500]   Okay, should I be worried?
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.900]   - What was the question?
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.740]   - Oh, the clerk said, "You're in room 1929.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.180]   "Should I be worried?"
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.940]   - Well, I don't think so.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.720]   I'm kind of curious as to why they gave you that room.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.620]   You know, was it because they thought you were 95 years old?
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.920]   (laughing)
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.380]   - I don't think there was anything terribly nefarious,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.980]   but I did think that it was one heck of a coincidence.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.500]   - So Bill mentioned he was going to ask me that yesterday,
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.660]   and I thought about it a little bit.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.760]   Then I realized my own room was 1521.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.820]   And I said, "Why would they put Bill in 1929?"
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.780]   And me in 1521.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.620]   And of course, the answer was immediately obvious
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.380]   to this historian.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.380]   1521 was the year the Pope excommunicated Martin Luther.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.500]   (laughing)
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.340]   And 1929 was the year
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.460]   that Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was born.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.700]   So that's the answer, Bill.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.180]   - Okay, help.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.140]   - The hotel has a sense of history.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.420]   (laughing)
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660]   - Very, very touche.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.100]   All right, so we're going to start with a subject
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.460]   I think that Dick wanted to begin with,
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.820]   and it's a good one, we touched on it already,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.120]   which is that the United States
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.620]   has large annual fiscal deficits.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.660]   We have a debt to GDP ratio,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.380]   which is now approaching one or greater than one,
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.700]   I don't know the exact value, but it's large.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.820]   Which is okay if you've just fought a war,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.780]   or maybe if you've just had an enormous financial crash.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.100]   But it is not good to have that
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.980]   at a time of prosperity and a time of peace.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.580]   And there doesn't seem to be any end of this in sight.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.420]   We seem to be headed toward a debt spiral.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.460]   And I'm wondering how worried you are about that
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.120]   and how worried we all should be about it.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.060]   - Well, this does bother me quite a bit,
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.820]   and I think it should bother most of you,
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.460]   because I believe it has investment implications
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.060]   going forward.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.980]   And you know, I'm a fairly old guy now,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.860]   and half a lifetime ago,
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.660]   I remember that the U.S. national debt was $1 trillion.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.380]   In 1980, that's like, in my case, half a lifetime ago.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   And now it's between $35 and $36 trillion.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.760]   And think about that.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.680]   You know, it took, what, 180 years of American history
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.800]   to get up a national debt of $1 trillion.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.640]   And now in the last 44 years,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.280]   we've run that up to $35 trillion.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.080]   So that, the number in itself,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.860]   is one that's worth thinking about.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.520]   But also, you know, you would say that,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.440]   you know, what does this represent?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.640]   And I think it represents fiscal irresponsibility.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   For most of American history,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.940]   we were a fiscally responsible country,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.320]   but in our political system, you know,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.240]   there might have been always a spending party
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.920]   and another party that was conservative
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.680]   and said we have to pay for things.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.640]   But it seems to me what bothers me most now,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.720]   and this is an election year,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.540]   but nobody talks about this.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.200]   You don't hear the candidates saying,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.440]   you know, nobody asks them,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.100]   what are we gonna do about this,
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.480]   having a, you know, trillion plus deficits every year.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.620]   And in the background, of course,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.000]   it's even worse than it seems
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   because if you can calculate what Social Security
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.840]   and Medicare are gonna cost down the road,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.520]   and, you know, some of those deficits
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.600]   dwarf even the, you know, trillion or two deficits
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   we've been running annually at the federal level.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.040]   And so why is it that, you know,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.680]   with all this going on,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.400]   it doesn't seem to be a major issue.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.080]   Neither party talks about it.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.940]   And I think it's got implications going forward
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.840]   for the investment world,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   and so we should all be thinking about that a little bit.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.840]   - How do you think it plays out?
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.680]   It's not gonna play out in an election year
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.000]   or the next five or six weeks.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.840]   - No.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.880]   - But it's gonna play out after that, I think,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.720]   and how do you think that happens?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.160]   - Yeah, well, I, you know, what's going on?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.880]   This is as old as the hills.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.160]   I mean, Alexander Hamilton talked about this
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   because in the 1790s, we had a,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.800]   when the government was first formed,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   we had a national debt of $70 million left over
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.240]   from the American Revolution.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.560]   And, you know, we didn't do anything about it in the 1780s,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.000]   and so the new government on the Constitution
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.720]   had to do something about it.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.080]   And so Hamilton basically funded the debt,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   created the Treasury bond market,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.760]   and, you know, founded the first national bank,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.640]   central bank.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.040]   But he said at the time that everybody was pressuring him
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.480]   to get us out of debt.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.840]   We wanna be out of debt as a country.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.080]   And Hamilton would say there are two ways to do that.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.320]   You know, we can raise taxes,
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.200]   and immediately the congressman said,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.040]   "No, no, we can't do that, we can't do that."
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.440]   Or the other way, Hamilton said, is we can reduce spending.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400]   And they said, "Well, we can't do that, we can't do that."
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.200]   And, but Mr. Hamilton,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.160]   we charge you with getting us out of debt.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.560]   And Hamilton then said,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.200]   this makes life very complicated for a finance minister
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.360]   because people have these inconsistent views.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   And it seems to me that's where we are now.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.160]   And many of us would say if somebody proposed,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.280]   you know, one of the candidates
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.720]   would propose much higher taxes this year,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.640]   we'd say, "I don't like that,
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.480]   "I'm not gonna vote for that person."
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.920]   Or if they talked about reducing spending,
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.680]   you know, cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.280]   we would say, "No, no, I can't vote for that candidate,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.320]   "but I'm very disturbed at the growing debt we have."
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   So we haven't changed much in 200 and some years,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.840]   but I think it's really a problem for our country,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.080]   and we should all be thinking about it a lot more
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.920]   and thinking how can we become more fiscally responsible?
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.000]   - Well, that's, you know, the collective action aspect of it,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.360]   but what are you doing about it as an investor?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.480]   - Well, my guess is that the,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.200]   unless something is done about it,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.880]   and I don't see any signs of that right now,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   that it means that we will have more inflation in the future
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.440]   because what inflation is, is the tax,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.760]   it's a form of taxation.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.200]   And if we won't pay real taxes,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   and we won't cut back on our government spending,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.520]   because nobody wants to pay higher real taxes,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.000]   and nobody wants to have lower government spending,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.920]   the only way the books are gonna balance
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.360]   is if we, inflation reduces the real value of the debt
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.720]   and makes it possible for the government to come through.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.680]   And you know, one of the first things you learn
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   in EC1 or EC10, whatever the course is,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   is that inflation is bad for creditors,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.200]   people who lend money,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.480]   because they get lower value money back when it's paid,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.320]   but it's really good for debtors,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:12.640]   because the debtor can pay back in lower value money.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.680]   And then you ask yourself,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.960]   who is the biggest debtor in the world?
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.640]   And the answer is the government
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.880]   of the United States of America.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   So our government actually has a vested interest
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   in inflation, I would say.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.720]   And I think that's something to keep in mind
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.760]   as you're making your investment decisions.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.400]   Been a lot of talk about tips
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.520]   and things like that at this conference.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.400]   And my own view, Bill told me once,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   he thought all the old people should invest in tips.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   But my view is that a little bit of tips
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   might belong in almost everyone's portfolio.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.480]   And when Consuelo Mack,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.120]   I don't know if you know Consuelo Mack
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.880]   has a TV show called WealthTrack,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.280]   and I've been on it a few times.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.000]   And at the end of it, she used to ask everyone,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.760]   what's your favorite recommended investment?
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.240]   And I said the same thing all the time.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.200]   I thought I was being safe and concerned.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.600]   Maybe everybody should have a little bit of tips
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.320]   in their portfolio.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.160]   - I guess I wouldn't disagree with that.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.960]   Okay, we're gonna turn the clock back now 13 years
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.320]   to the year 2011, which was a bit of a scary year.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.080]   And you were interviewed for the Wall Street Journal
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.560]   by Jim Browning, D.S. Browning.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   I don't know how he got the name Jim,
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.520]   but that's what everybody calls him.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.920]   And this was a bad week in the stock market
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.080]   in September of 2011.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   And he wanted your very, very long-term perspective.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   And so you said that you wanted to take a long-term approach
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.200]   and you showed him this graph,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.080]   which got published in the journal article.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.960]   And it's a nice sort of rolling graph
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.640]   of 10-year returns of the stock market.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   And so right at the far right aspect of that
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.200]   was returns had been near zero.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.600]   In fact, as Paul Merriman mentioned a couple times,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.160]   and I'm fond of quoting as well,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.880]   between 2000 and 2009, that decade,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.320]   U.S. stocks lost about 20% in real terms.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.640]   And you thought that augured well for the stock market.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.080]   You thought that stocks would be a good place to invest.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   And of course, you were right.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.360]   And so I decided to look and see if there was any value
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.680]   in looking at 10-year stock returns.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.520]   And this is sort of a dirty graph.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   It sort of slopes down into the right,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.440]   but it's a very dirty graph.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.720]   So I lengthened that to 15 years,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.960]   and then 20 years, and then finally 30 years.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.600]   And boy, at 30 years, it sure looks really pretty
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.640]   off on the left side, okay?
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.920]   All you have to do is wait for 30-year real returns
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   of near 0% or 1% or 2%,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.840]   and you have it made in the shade.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.280]   Now, the problem with that is there aren't
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.200]   that many independent 30-year returns.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.240]   In fact, when you're looking at the far left side
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.720]   of that graph, you're only really talking about,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.800]   I think, 1830-something and 1938 or something like that.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.880]   So really, you have to wait 100 years
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.560]   to execute this strategy.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.600]   And the problem becomes immediately apparent
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.040]   when you just take rolling 30-year stock returns.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.520]   You see that in the past century,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.240]   there's been only one period of time,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.200]   almost 100 years ago, when we saw real returns,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.080]   30-year returns of near zero.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   And even if you held your threshold for buying at 5%,
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.680]   that you really were only going to have
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   one or two opportunities, buying opportunities.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.440]   So how do you use rolling returns
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.400]   and realized returns of stocks?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.600]   How valuable do you think they are?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.120]   - Well, if you want to go back
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.880]   to the Wall Street Journal chart,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.080]   that was, one thing I did in my checkered career
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.200]   was to actually extend our knowledge
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.840]   of the U.S. stock market back to almost the beginning.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.280]   And the only way you could do that
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.240]   was by looking at old newspapers,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.880]   because the newspapers starting in the 1790s
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   began to report the stocks then were usually bank stocks,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.800]   local bank stocks, and the Bank of the United States.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.080]   And then you had three kinds of government bonds
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.440]   that Hamilton had issued.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.160]   And they were reported.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.880]   I mean, I think one of the great things about our country
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.080]   is it had somewhat modern finances right from the beginning.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   And that's the debt I think we should all remember
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   that we owe to Alexander Hamilton.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.560]   Because he had this idea that,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240]   he knew his financial history.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.600]   If you read about Hamilton,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   he would talk about Dutch finance and British finance,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.120]   the Italians, and what was going on.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.960]   And he thought the U.S. ought to be equipped
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.760]   with modern financial arrangements.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.520]   We were probably the third country in the world
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.160]   after the Dutch and the British
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.240]   to have modern financials system.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.640]   And we had it right from the beginning of the country.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.200]   So you could actually go back and get,
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.760]   this is from 1801 to 19, to 2010 or something like that.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.360]   And so we got the stock market data,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.160]   made some assumptions for the earlier,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.200]   before we made the 1870 on it, it was easy.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.560]   The previous work had been done.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.800]   But going back to the beginning of the country.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.480]   And what I noticed was that there's this kind of pattern,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.640]   up and down, up and down.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.440]   And so in the year 2000, actually 1999,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.520]   when everybody was worried about the dot-com bubble,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.800]   I was asked to give some talk.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.400]   And I brought out this chart.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.640]   And it was only up to 1999 then.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.560]   But I said the 10-year moving average real returns,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.440]   that's what this shows,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.680]   10-year moving average real returns,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.840]   they've fluctuated a lot through U.S. history.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.240]   It looks like there's, roughly speaking,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.880]   on average there's 10 years up and 10 years down.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   And usually when you got to some very high level,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.600]   the range of this at the maximum,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   you can see like in 1929 or late 1950s or '60s,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.440]   and then again in 1999, when you're up at that level,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   maybe 16, 17, 18%, usually what happens
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.040]   when you're at one of those peaks,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.000]   the next 10 years aren't so good.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.640]   So what I did in 2000 when I first did this,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.200]   and this is what Jim Browning knew about
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.240]   and why he wrote the article,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.280]   is I said, let me assume that the returns
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.080]   for the next 10 years, that is 2000 to 2009,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.720]   will just be 0%, we're talking about
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.640]   real stock market returns every year, 0%.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.380]   And I got the red chart there, the red line.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.520]   And it turns out that over the next 10 years,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.360]   the blue line is what actually happened
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.320]   and the red was almost the same as the blue.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.160]   So hey, I'm a pretty smart guy, right?
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.000]   (laughing)
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.200]   And so Browning thought about that
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   and he said, well, what's, in 2010, 2011,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.400]   I talked to a lot of investment groups in New York
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   and they want to know what's gonna happen next.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.340]   And I said, well, when things are that bad for 10 years,
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.480]   usually the next 10 years are better.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.040]   So then the Wall Street Journal asked me
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.760]   to calculate what might happen in the next 10 years.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.600]   So I made another simple assumption
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.680]   that let's just suppose the average return
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.120]   that is throughout US history
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.980]   is what we'll get in the next 10 years.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.800]   And I got, at that time, my forecast
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.720]   of what the market would do in the next 10 years.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.280]   It's actually done a lot better than that
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.860]   because it's done above average.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.560]   But when I made this statement,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.480]   it said the next 10 years will be better,
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.760]   everyone was pessimistic.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.440]   Well, no, we don't think you're right.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.320]   They really got burned in 2007 to 2009
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.360]   and they were very skeptical in 2011
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.120]   that the stock market was gonna do well.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.360]   Well, I turned out to have been not optimistic enough.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.800]   So, and basically, that's where this comes from.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.720]   But you can sort of get an average,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.640]   I mean, the range is from a return
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.880]   of about 16, 17, 18% a year
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.160]   at the various peaks you see in this 200-year chart.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.600]   And the low is down around zero, usually.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   And so I think that my guess is to answer the question
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.480]   is that this pattern will continue.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.000]   We're actually much higher now than my forecast,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.760]   that red line.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.240]   I haven't really updated my,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.800]   but I think we're in the last 10 years
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.120]   of moving average return.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.120]   Real return would be something like 15 or 16 or 17%.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.960]   So if the past is any guide to the future,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   I don't think you should expect really great stock returns,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.640]   let's say for the next decade or so.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.480]   - Yeah.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.480]   Those of us who've been coming to this conference
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.800]   for a little while know that Jack would go through
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.080]   an orthogonal episode exercise,
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.600]   an exercise that was a little different,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.640]   but it would arrive at exactly the same conclusion.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.600]   He would do a Gordon equation type of exercise
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.560]   where he would add the dividend yield
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.800]   and then the dividend growth.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.640]   And then he would add in a mean reversion term,
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.200]   which was basically based
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.120]   on the cape cyclically adjusted earnings.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.000]   And so he came to this conference,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.560]   one of the very first ones in 2002,
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.680]   and basically said, we're looking at zero returns,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   nominal returns over the next 10 years.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.800]   And in 2011, 2012, he came and was much as optimistic
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.200]   as you are for, basically amounts to the same reason.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.600]   One of my very favorite stories even predates that.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.040]   It was in the year 2000.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.760]   And I had the pleasure of following him
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.240]   around New York for a day,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.920]   which included a dinner in which I made sure
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.160]   he had had his second martini before I asked him,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.320]   had he changed his asset allocation at all?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.800]   Because he had written that you should never, ever do that.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.600]   And he sort of looked conspiratorially over his shoulder.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.840]   And he said, well, I've sold about five
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.280]   or 10% of my stocks.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.200]   So even he was not--
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.640]   - He's a market timer.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.840]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.280]   I never held him to that.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.960]   Well, all right.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.200]   So the next graph, and we'll be done with graphs
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.160]   here shortly, I apologize for these.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.040]   This comes from your book, A History of Interest Rates.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.800]   And this is just an example or an illustration
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.160]   of what's happened to interest rates
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.800]   over the past millennium, more or less.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.000]   Dick pointed out to me when I showed him this graph
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.960]   that I could have used a much better data set
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.200]   later on in the book, which would have been even prettier.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.680]   But you see that the rate of return on securities
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.520]   has been falling.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.160]   These are debt securities.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.280]   And this is work that was done more recently
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.440]   by Paul Schmelzing.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.720]   I guess Rogoff and Rossi got their names on it.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.840]   But I think he's the one who did all the legwork.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.320]   And what you're looking at is the returns, again,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   to debt instruments over the past 700 years or so.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.800]   So it shows that the rate of return on investments
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.320]   is falling.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.960]   I think Dick knows I have my own theory as to why this is,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.760]   but I'd like to hear your theory
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   of exactly what's going on here
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.160]   and what that means to people in this room.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.720]   - Well, I want to say a couple things first.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.240]   Sidney Homer wrote the book, A History of Interest Rates,
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.840]   but he passed away around 1980, I think.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.520]   And so he did a couple of editions.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.040]   But after that, people were still interested
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   in interest rates.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.480]   So I was asked to update the book and keep it going.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.440]   And I did a couple of more editions of it.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.000]   I think Homer did a great job of getting
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.400]   the long-term interest rates going way back in history.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.360]   I think the earliest hard numbers were the Code of Hammurabi
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   where cash loans were 20% and grain loans were 33%.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.320]   And so this one goes back, let's see,
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.440]   it goes back to the Middle Ages, I guess.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.080]   Homer and I found that there was a long-term trend down
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.760]   in interest rates.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.160]   And that's what Schmelzing finds.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.440]   But Schmelzing actually did a lot more work.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.160]   He really enriched the database by doing a lot of hard work
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.000]   in archives in Europe,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   things that Homer didn't know about
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.680]   and I didn't know about either.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   But I think they basically get the same thing.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   There's been a long-term declining trend
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.880]   in real interest rates.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.720]   And you see they were back in the 1300s, I guess.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.000]   They were between 10,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   and these are sort of the lowest interest rates,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.840]   10 or 12%.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   And then you get down to in the vicinity of zero there
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.160]   in the early 20th century.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.520]   And now it looks more like it's hard
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.520]   to see exactly where it is, but somewhere positive.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.200]   Anyway, Schmelzing, I know him
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.320]   and we've had some chats and all that.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.760]   And he actually tried to be provocative by saying,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.560]   this trend is gonna continue.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   And one great point in recent years
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.080]   when interest rates were so low
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.880]   until the recent Fed raising,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.160]   we all thought that was abnormal.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.640]   These were abnormally low rates.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.040]   And I said myself, I'm very privileged
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   to have lived in the period I did
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.760]   because I have seen the highest interest rates
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.440]   in US history around 1980, '81.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.200]   And I have seen the lowest interest rates
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.800]   in US history in 2010 to 2020.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.400]   And Schmelzing said, well,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.120]   this is just a long-term trend.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.000]   All these people saying interest rates
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.200]   are really unusually low
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.680]   and they aren't gonna stay that way a few years ago.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   Schmelzing says, no, no,
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.800]   we're right where we should be in history.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.760]   And in fact, they're gonna go even lower
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.480]   and money is sort of gonna be freely available.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.680]   The real interest rate will be in the vicinity of zero
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.720]   in just a few years.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.360]   Well, that was provocative, I think.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   But I think what the low rates recently are sort of rigged,
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.640]   I call it financial repression.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.880]   I mean, the Fed buying mortgage bonds
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.440]   and keeping the rates low.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.640]   I think we've seen now in the last couple of years
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.440]   the normalization that I would have expected.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.160]   - Yeah, so financial economists like to talk about,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.200]   I think it's R*, which is the natural rate of interest.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.840]   And you think that R* is about 2%.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.760]   - Yeah, I would think so.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.120]   I think, you know, I just have a feeling in my bones
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.760]   that there's probably some theory that could predict it,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   that the R* is roughly the rate,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.640]   real rate of economic growth of the economy.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.120]   So the 20th century, we grew at about 3%,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.560]   I think, per year, real economic growth.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.320]   In the 19th century, it was about 4%.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.880]   And more lately, we're thinking,
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.160]   well, 2% growth is really not so bad.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.120]   And I think the natural rate of interest
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.840]   is something like the real growth rate of the economy.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.080]   And so I think it might be about 2% now,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.280]   because that seems to be how fast we can grow.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.640]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   I mean, I read the same, Schmelzing's working paper,
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.040]   and then this paper.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.960]   And I have to admit that I thought to myself,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   my gosh, this guy is prescient,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.040]   because we are looking at zero and negative real rates now.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.080]   But I think you're right.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.920]   I think that those probably are--
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.280]   - Remember, those are real rates.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.680]   So if 2% is the real rate,
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.560]   and we're having 3% inflation,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.280]   then the interest rates might be, you know, 5%.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.880]   - So I think the piece of short-term advice
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.560]   that we would get out of that is,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.760]   you don't have to be in a rush to buy TIPS right now.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.560]   There may be higher rates on offer at some point later.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.880]   - It could be, it could be.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.800]   - Yeah.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.280]   All right.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   So that's the one thing I will point out,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.680]   which is that we talked about a session and a half ago,
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.320]   which is that at this conference last year,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.480]   we were like two weeks or a week off of the peak of,
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.640]   from the peak of TIPS rates.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.280]   And there was a lot of excitement and a lot of buzz,
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.200]   and perhaps too much buzz
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.440]   and too much excitement about them.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.040]   So it's, I'm reasonably heartened,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.160]   because I don't want TIPS rates to necessarily fall.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.680]   I'd like to be collecting those fat coupons
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.640]   for the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.560]   I will add that those of you who have questions,
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.280]   Karen is, and one or two other people are going around.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.960]   So if you have questions for us, let us know.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   All right, well, you know, the next question that I have,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.640]   I guess, has to do with investment frictions.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.000]   You were, you came of the financial age
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   at a time when the financial frictions,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.640]   at least by today's standards, were absolutely gargantuan.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.480]   When simply it was absolutely impossible
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.000]   to put together an indexed portfolio,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   you know, buy the S&P 500.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.160]   People often talk about, you know,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   if you'd only invested in the S&P 500
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.360]   when the Ibsen database incepted in 1926,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.040]   you know, you'd have, I think it's $15,000
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.400]   for every dollar you invested then.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.800]   But of course, the problem was that that was uninvestable.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.040]   And when it comes to small value stocks,
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.520]   they really didn't become investable
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.240]   for the small investor until the early 1990s.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   So the returns that you see going back
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.280]   were returns that were basically
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.640]   garnered by very, very small business people
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.720]   who owned shares of small corporations very individually.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   There was nobody who could actually own
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   a small cap value index fund until really 1990, 1992 or so.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.520]   And so the question I have for you
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.840]   is now that you can buy the entire stock market
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.440]   for a couple of basis points,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.320]   or if you're willing to leave your money in Fidelity
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.600]   for the rest of your life, zero basis points,
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.800]   you know, how do you think that's impacted
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.840]   the financial markets
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.720]   and what individual investors should be doing?
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.520]   In other words, do you think that that lack of frictions,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.360]   the fall in intermediation costs have,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.240]   or will lead to lower returns?
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.280]   - I don't, I can't really see a connection
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.880]   why the cost of intermediation where we're trading stocks,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.960]   you know, which are very low now and almost free, right?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.880]   Almost free.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.400]   I don't see how that should, I mean,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.600]   it should impact returns by saying that,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.920]   well, the costs are lower,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   so whatever the return is will be better than it would be
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.000]   if the cost of investing had been higher.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.720]   But I don't see a really strong connection.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.680]   And, you know, I knew Jack Bogle pretty well.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   He was, I considered him a friend
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.680]   at least for the last 10 years of his life.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.840]   And, you know, he would have thought
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.120]   these low costs of trading were really great,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.280]   but he would worry about the implication
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.000]   that it would, if it was really cheap to trade,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.960]   then people would probably do too much trading.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.240]   He liked to say, you know,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.840]   I remember when he was a visiting professor at NYU,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.960]   thanks to the beneficence of Henry Kaufman,
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.800]   he used to say, when the American people go to bed at night,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.600]   they own exactly the same portfolio of stocks
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.320]   that they owned when they got up in the morning,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.760]   which probably isn't true if, you know,
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.960]   foreigners were buying or selling stock that day
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   and we were buying.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.240]   But anyway, he didn't like the idea
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   that we should be trading a lot.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.880]   But he liked low costs, but he didn't like a lot of trading.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.080]   So I, but really, I think, you know,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.960]   if we avoid the temptation to overtrade,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.800]   and I think, as I understand this very sensible group,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.360]   none of you would ever do that.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.080]   If we avoid the temptation to overtrade,
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.640]   we should just be glad that the costs of intermediation
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.680]   are so low because, you know,
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.720]   when I bought my first stocks back in the 1960s,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.000]   I guess I was buying funds,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.640]   but you didn't wanna really trade very much
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.880]   'cause the brokerage costs were higher.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.520]   Funds had, you know, some of the mutual funds
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.640]   had seven or 8% upfront charges, you know,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.920]   that was really discouraged trading.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.120]   I think basically the way our markets
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.160]   have developed over history
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.280]   is the way our political system has developed
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.680]   in the sense that we, more and more people were brought in,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.840]   and you know, when Thomas Jefferson said,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.280]   "All men are created equal,"
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   he met all white men with property,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.400]   but he didn't include women, he didn't include black people,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.120]   he didn't include Native Americans.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.840]   But over time, we've become much more inclusive
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.760]   in who we allow to vote.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.400]   I think we've also become much more inclusive
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   in making investments available to a wider range of people,
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.320]   and that's been a good thing.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.480]   And low costs are certainly something Jack Bogle loved,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.960]   so I think they're a good thing,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.200]   as long as we avoid the temptation to overtrade.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.880]   No day traders in the group, are there?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.000]   - Yeah, I mean, when it comes to, you know,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.240]   trading and buying versus buying and holding,
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.520]   I think that this particular room
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.880]   is almost a point singularity in this quadrant of the galaxy.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.480]   Out there, the rest of the world,
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.800]   and the way they emotionally approach investing
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.480]   is somewhat different, although, you know, in fairness,
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:58.320]   the use of target date funds as default vehicles
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.720]   in defined contribution plans
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.960]   certainly has been, you know,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.720]   brought about a real improvement.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.840]   The one thing I would observe though, Dick,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.560]   is that, you know, you go back to, you know,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.040]   the Great Depression, or even for that matter, the 1950s,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.440]   only a very small percent of people invested in stocks.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.240]   I haven't, it's been a while since I've looked
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.080]   at the Labor Department's data on this,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.720]   but only, you know, until 30, 40 years ago,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.400]   only about 10% of people owned stocks,
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.440]   whereas now it's much more than half
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.840]   because of defined contribution plans.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.120]   And that, you know, there's an upward trend,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.840]   obviously, over the past 100 years in that number,
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.360]   but there's also been some variation
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.240]   within that period of time.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.440]   And, you know, you go back, for example, to 1980,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.800]   only 20, 20%, 25% of people owned stocks,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   and that was a great time to buy stocks.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.320]   - It was, I mean, the '70s turned out, you know,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.160]   were a terrible time for the stock market.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.800]   I mean, I remember that in 19,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.480]   I think I first bought stocks when the Dow Jones average
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   in the middle of the 1960s was around 900.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   And 17 years later, in August 1982,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.360]   the Dow Jones average was 780.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.800]   And in between, you know, there had been all this inflation
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.720]   that sort of averaged 6% a year,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.240]   if you remember the great inflation
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.360]   from the late 1960s through the early 1980s.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.320]   Inflation was 6% a year, and stocks, you know,
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.960]   the Dow average had actually gone down over that period.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.800]   So in real terms, investors were really cream,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.720]   but you could get, you know, that was a good time to buy.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   My wife and I were professors,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   and I knew finance theory way back in the 1960s,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.720]   and I said, you know, we're young now,
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.120]   and so we should put all of our money into equities.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.400]   And we did, and then in the '70s,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.680]   my equities weren't doing very much,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.800]   but I steadily put in the little bit of money
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.080]   that I could put in month by month.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.600]   And my wife, she said, interest rates are very high now,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   so I'm gonna reduce, I'm gonna disagree with you
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.840]   and not put so much money into stocks,
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.680]   I'm gonna put it into interest.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.280]   And she was sort of right for a while,
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.520]   I think her stuff grew faster than mine,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.760]   but in the 1980s, she turned out to be wrong
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.840]   when the stock market recovered
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.560]   and the Great Bull market began.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.520]   So it was, yeah, I mean, it was a good time to buy stocks.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.560]   But most people at the time thought it was terrible
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.240]   because the stock market wasn't doing anything.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   That's the time to buy.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.680]   Who was it, J. Paul Getty said,
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.520]   other people have said something like it,
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.760]   buy when everybody else is selling
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.160]   and hold on until everybody else is buying.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.680]   - Yeah, or Buffett's famous quote,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.160]   that to be greedy when others are fearful
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.720]   and fearful when others are greedy.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.560]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.120]   - Which you mentioned though, the word inflation.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.800]   Again, I really wanna get back
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.000]   to one of the first questions I asked you,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.440]   which is what do you think happens
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.160]   to our increasingly dire,
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.760]   the nation's increasingly dire fiscal situation?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.480]   Increased taxes, decreased benefits,
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.720]   or the government will inflate things away with debt.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.040]   Which do you think of those is most likely?
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.100]   - I think right now, I would say,
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.800]   since nobody's talking about this
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.840]   at high levels of government,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.640]   that inflating away, making the government's financials,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.560]   the arrangements easier, inflation is ahead.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.240]   That's what I would worry about.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.880]   And of course, the Fed is committed to 2%.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.640]   I could never figure out why they were committed to 2%.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.960]   Zero seemed pretty good to me.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.580]   The 19th century, the country did pretty well,
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   and the inflation rate of the 19th century was 0%.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.620]   But now we say 2% is okay.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.360]   And I think the signs I would look for
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.720]   is when we, I would expect something like this
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.800]   to occur fairly soon.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.960]   Well, we're close enough to 2%
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.800]   that we don't really have to,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.160]   everything's fine now,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.440]   and then it'll creep back up toward 3%.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.240]   And they'll say, well, that's okay.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.200]   And maybe we could live with 3%.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.480]   I'm sort of disgusted with some of my fellow economists
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.960]   who said, we should make 3% the target now.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   I think that's kind of irresponsible economic advice.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.800]   But if it goes up to 4% or so,
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   then you're getting back to our situation in the 19,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.760]   like we had in the 1970s,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.240]   where it's sort of bad for the stock market.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.480]   - Okay, here's another question for you,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   which I can't help but ask you,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.000]   which is, you're an educator.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.040]   And what reading, what is the essential reading
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.880]   that everyone should be doing in this room
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.280]   regarding financial history?
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   If you could read one or two books, which would they be?
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.400]   - Well, one that just came out a year or so ago,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.080]   and I think is pretty good,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   and it's by a non-academic fellow named Mark Higgins.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   It's a book called "Investing in U.S. Financial History."
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.080]   It's a fairly big book,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   and it seems to have done pretty well in its first year,
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   because now they're gonna make it into an audio book.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.080]   I mean, the book is full of charts and tables
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.100]   and things like that.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.400]   I don't know what happens to them in an audio book,
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   but Mark Higgins, "Investing in U.S. Financial History."
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.520]   And I've been teaching a sort of short course
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.160]   in financial history in retirement
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   at the Fordham Business School, the Gabelli School.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.600]   And we used the book last year,
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.040]   and the students sort of liked it.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.560]   So you like to assign students books that they like.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.880]   And this Mark Higgins book,
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.280]   I think he puts together a lot of 200 years,
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.680]   230 years of U.S. financial,
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   all the way through the COVID pandemic,
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.840]   and starting off with Alexander Hamilton, I suppose.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.360]   And it's just, and he's big on people like Hedy Green,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.600]   who was this woman investor in the 19th century.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.640]   And a lot of people, they call her the witch of Wall Street,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.040]   but he says Hedy Green was really smart,
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.420]   and a lot smarter than the men
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.600]   that she was dealing with back in those days.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.560]   So that's a nice feature of the book as well.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.920]   But yeah, I mean, I think a long-term view
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.840]   of what happens, such as we had in a few charts here,
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.560]   it's really worth having.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   We get kind of, we're too oriented toward the latest event.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.360]   What did the Fed do last week,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.100]   or what is it gonna do next week?
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:46.100]   And on Wall Street, they say history is five minutes ago.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.720]   I think people should have a longer-term perspective.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.880]   And I detect in this Bogleheads group
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.200]   that people do have a longer perspective.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.080]   - Yeah, I will second Dick's recommendation
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.960]   of the Higgins book.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.200]   It is spectacular.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.800]   Investing in U.S. market history, right?
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.960]   - Investing in U.S. financial history.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.920]   - Financial history, yeah, right.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.040]   It's a spectacular-- - So it has double meaning.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.880]   - Good book.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.240]   One of the reasons why I read it, by the way,
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.380]   was that Dick had told me to read it.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.920]   He had reviewed the book favorably,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.880]   and one or two other people who I respected as well.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.840]   And hopefully, with luck,
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.000]   we can get him at the conference next year.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.840]   All right, well, here is a good question.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.260]   What do we miss by focusing on market history
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.480]   primarily in the U.S.?
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.840]   Should we be considering a global historical view
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.880]   when thinking about the future?
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.440]   And I actually broached this
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.800]   with one of the other speakers last night.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.620]   And he discounted a lot of foreign financial history
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.820]   because it was blighted by war and conflict,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.720]   which he thinks is much less of a consideration
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.920]   in this country.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.480]   So you look at the financial history in Austria and Italy
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.120]   and Germany and Japan, and it's awful
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.440]   because those countries were leveled in war,
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.540]   and he says that's not relevant to here.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.440]   So what do you think about that?
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.360]   - Well, I think the U.S.,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.120]   we talk about emerging markets,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.600]   and China's been a great emerging market
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.840]   for the last 40 years,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.520]   and Japan probably in the late 20th century
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.320]   was a great big emerging market.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.000]   But our own country, the United States,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.400]   was probably the most successful emerging market
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.920]   of the last 200 years 'cause we were an emerging market.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.720]   And it turns out that we were
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.840]   a very successful emerging market,
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.360]   and we all had these financial markets,
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   treasury bond markets, stock markets,
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.680]   going back to the beginning,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.080]   and we also have the best records of it.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.500]   So when the world looks at equity investment,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.580]   they often, everybody's thinking
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.280]   about what happened in the U.S.,
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920]   but as Bill pointed out, in most other countries,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.280]   the experience wasn't nearly as good as that.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:13.320]   And in some places, stock markets disappeared altogether.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.160]   In the United States, there'd been a few times
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.760]   when the stock market was shut down.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.200]   I think it was shut down for a few days in 1873
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.040]   when there was a financial panic,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.240]   and it was shut down by government order,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.580]   although we only found that out recently,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:33.580]   from the end of July 1914 until December of 1914.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.960]   It turns out that the Treasury Secretary
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.080]   asked the New York Stock Exchange to shut down.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.920]   But in other countries,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.560]   markets have disappeared altogether.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.360]   Think if you were an investor in Russia.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.120]   They had a big industrialization movement
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.280]   on the stock market.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.640]   If you've been to St. Petersburg,
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.560]   there's a nice building on the waterfront there
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.920]   that was the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange,
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.160]   and maybe it is again now.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.400]   But there was a period from 1917 through 1990
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.220]   when it was not the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.160]   So there is a bias in the way people around the world
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.600]   look at financial markets.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.200]   A lot of what they know is U.S. financial history
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.360]   because we had a successful market
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.300]   and we had the best data.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:23.040]   But still, since half the world's market cap
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.360]   is, roughly speaking, half the world market cap
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.120]   is the United States, it's not so bad.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.920]   The world knows that we had a good record
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.020]   and they invest here.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.800]   - Do you worry at all about,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.000]   and this is talking about global stock markets in particular,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.300]   about declining birth rates,
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.600]   particularly in developed nations?
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.260]   I mean, I think that the fertility rate in Korea is 0.8.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.800]   You need 2.1 for replacement.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.500]   Japan is almost as bad.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.960]   - Yeah, well, there were people in the past
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.480]   that worried about too many people in the world.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.800]   Remember, there were people saying
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.640]   we're all gonna starve to death
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.040]   because there's too many people in the world.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.640]   But now they're talking the opposite way,
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.180]   that the world population is gonna start shrinking.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.980]   Actually, economic historians, I'm one of them,
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.100]   we've done a lot of study of, not myself,
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.620]   but other people have done,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.060]   it's called the demographic transition.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.180]   And usually in a pre-modern world
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.480]   based largely on agriculture, birth rates are high.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.420]   And then as countries modernize and become more diversified,
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.620]   commercial, industrial, post-industrial,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.080]   birth rates come down.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.700]   And there's been a lot of speculation why that happens.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.900]   But I think now, most of the world
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.500]   is commercializing and industrializing.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.620]   And so the birth rates are coming down.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.540]   And it may be that we're not too far
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.660]   from peak world population.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.780]   And after 2050, it may start shrinking.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.460]   And I think in places in the world
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.800]   where population has gone down, certain countries,
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.860]   like Italy for the last 20 or 30 years
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.700]   has had a declining population, I think.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.900]   And their economy hasn't been doing very well.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.980]   So we're gonna have to figure out
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.940]   what we need to do in the economy
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.600]   with the fewer people every year.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.840]   And that usually means that more and more of the people
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.540]   are old and there are fewer young people.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.780]   So that has implications for the social safety net.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.680]   Young people pay into Social Security
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.540]   so that guys like Bill and me can get our monthly check.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.860]   And what happens when there are very few young people
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.060]   and a bunch of old guys like Bill and me?
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.860]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, whenever I see a younger person
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.420]   who is trying to save for retirement,
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.460]   especially if they've got an enormous amount of student debt,
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.700]   I apologize to them for stealing their future,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.460]   which is what we boomers did and people older than boomers,
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.460]   like Dick did, is we really did a job on Generation Z
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.340]   and even Generation X for that matter.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.380]   - You used to say there were bumper stickers in Florida
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.180]   that said spending the kid's inheritance.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.620]   - Yeah, I mean, my med school tuition,
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.660]   I'm fond of telling people, was $1,550 a year.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.260]   All right, even adjusted for inflation,
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.400]   it was still pretty ridiculously low.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.260]   Reserve currency status, okay?
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.740]   Do you worry about the U.S. losing
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.140]   its reserve currency status
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.860]   and what investment implications do you think that has
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.580]   for individual investors?
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.220]   - Well, there's no doubt that the U.S. gains a lot
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.300]   by being the world's reserve currency.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.180]   I mean, if you think about it for a few cents,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.360]   the government can run off a $100 bill
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.100]   and then it can buy $100 worth of goods
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.340]   in the United States or it can buy $100 worth of goods
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.180]   in foreign countries.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:01.160]   So that's, we call it, the technical term is seniorage.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.020]   The U.S. gets a lot of seniorage
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.440]   from being able to print a $100 bill for a few cents
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.340]   and get $100 worth of goods for it.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.640]   So that is a great advantage of the United States.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.060]   It's worth trying to protect it, I guess,
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.700]   and there are challengers.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.980]   China, I mean, I had some folks from China
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.220]   come into my office at NYU once and say,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.860]   we want to build up our currency
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.120]   to be a sort of reserve currency.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.580]   And how can we do it?
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.740]   And I said, well, the first thing is
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.140]   you have to let people take money in and out of your country.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:38.140]   You can't regulate capital flows as much as you do.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.340]   But they're working on that now.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.220]   And people thought the euro would be a good rival,
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.240]   but the euro has its own problems.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.900]   But it is worth keeping the currency.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.260]   And remember, it's being threatened partly by things
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.460]   like the sanctions we put on Russia,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.420]   seizing some of their assets and that
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.980]   after the invasion of Ukraine.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   So I think you have to have a sort of set of,
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.820]   people won't trust you.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.980]   I mean, I think that we've actually lost
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.860]   some of that trust just in the last few years
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.500]   by some of the things we've done to,
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.220]   some call it the weaponization of the dollar.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.820]   We're gonna make it hard for you to deal in dollars.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.140]   And if people will look at that, they say,
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.700]   well, we better think twice about holding dollars
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.300]   as a reserve currency.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.260]   And it's well known now that many countries in the world
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.020]   that held gold reserves in the United States
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.740]   and had a lot of dollar assets,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.720]   they've been taking their gold home from the United States.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.020]   I think the Germans loaded up a lot of their gold
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.700]   in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and took it home.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.580]   'Cause that's where the gold vault
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.020]   of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.340]   has a bunch of gold in it.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.100]   It's a good tourist stop if you can get in there.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.860]   And they used to say a financial crisis,
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.500]   the actual real world equivalent of a financial crisis
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.180]   was some guy in the vault
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.860]   in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.700]   would take some gold bars from one country's vault
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.080]   and put them in another country's vault.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.060]   That's what a financial crisis was.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.620]   - Well, one final question,
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.660]   which is if index fund investing has revolutionized
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.720]   the last 30 to 40 years,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.620]   what technological advances do you see
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.900]   coming down the pike?
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.660]   Or are you of the school of thought
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.500]   that says it's impossible to forecast technology?
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.380]   - Well, I don't know about technology.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.180]   It's hard to forecast technology,
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.220]   but it's very important to have some idea where it's going.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.780]   If we're now stuck in a 2% real growth world,
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.580]   it's because technological change
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.280]   is not as fast as it was in the past.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.100]   College classmate of mine, Robert Gordon,
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.340]   wrote a book a few years ago,
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.920]   The Rise and Fall of U.S. Growth.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.500]   And he basically said the great inventions
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.820]   were the indoor plumbing and things like that.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.140]   He used to love to hold up his iPhone and say,
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.580]   "If you had a choice between indoor plumbing
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.660]   "and this iPhone, which would you choose?"
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.260]   (laughing)
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.140]   Most people would say, "Indoor plumbing
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.860]   "was maybe a little more important to us
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.280]   "than having an iPhone."
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:26.020]   So anyway, if we are to grow faster again,
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.740]   and people think we ought to grow at 3%
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.660]   or something like that,
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   it'll be dependent on technology and technological advance.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.420]   So there'll be a lot of improvements.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.600]   I think, I don't know if it's just technology,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.540]   but I think now, at certain points in my life,
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.860]   I said, "Well, should I get involved
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.480]   "in commodity investments?
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.340]   "Or should I just kind of stick to the stock market
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:53.260]   "and the bond markets, fixed income markets?"
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.460]   And I once dabbled in commodities.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.020]   I didn't have any great success or any great failures,
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.120]   but I just decided it required too much work
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.040]   to keep up with that.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.940]   What I've noticed now is I have silver in my portfolio
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.980]   because I can buy SLV.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.700]   That's a silver, apparently, if I give 'em $1,000,
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.220]   they buy $1,000 of silver, but it's a tradable security.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.500]   Or GLD, gold is another one.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.460]   So the markets have improved to the point
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.340]   where you can become a commodity investor
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:27.420]   without really dealing with the Chicago commodity exchanges.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:31.160]   And I see that, the financial world is becoming
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.660]   much more sophisticated and opening up new opportunities
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:39.540]   to people, easy investment in commodities.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.540]   And I noticed my silver's up 30% this year,
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.400]   so not bad.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.020]   If I say everybody should have a little bit of tips
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.900]   in their portfolio, I might also say
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.660]   that maybe everybody should have a little bit
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.580]   of silver or gold, and it's very easy to do that now,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.220]   much easier than in the past.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.180]   - Yeah, that's one way to do it.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.420]   And silver, SLV, and GLD are two things
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.140]   that you can buy that you can actually benefit
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.540]   from the spot price.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.820]   Otherwise, when you're dealing,
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.820]   unless you can store a large amount of grain and oil
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.180]   in your backyard, you can't own the spot price.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.100]   You have to deal with futures,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.980]   and the problem with dealing with futures
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.580]   is that if too many people chase them,
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.900]   you wind up in something called--
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.660]   - Right, the great worry, they used to say
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.580]   the great worry of a commodity investor
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:33.580]   is that someday a railroad car will come up to their house
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.880]   and unload 50,000 pounds of pork bellies.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.260]   (laughing)
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.300]   - Okay, well, I think we'll call it a day.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.140]   - Okay.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.200]   you
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
