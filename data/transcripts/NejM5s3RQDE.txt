[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   think series like it was just a little hobby a little something fun to do but um i think i really
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.880]   decided last i want to say probably like three four months ago um to take it seriously i was reading
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.680]   a book and one of the chapters it was talking about that thing that you've been putting off your whole
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.440]   life that you want to get to in the future spend an hour a day on it now don't don't think you're
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   gonna get to it later spend time on that thing now and so that day i decided to start taking carrie's
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.200]   mic seriously i ordered my little tripod my little vlog camera and from that point i just started
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   started shooting little content shooting little vlogs and um doing little things like that i was
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.600]   like man if i can do the vlogs if i could do the interviews with people and i can do the self-reflection
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.160]   videos that'll make it so that i can be consistent and i always have something to talk about so
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.000]   um it's just the start of it for me but it's cool to see that
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   you know it's already gaining a little traction and people are kind of like hearing what i'm saying
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.920]   and appreciate some appreciate it some don't but we're gonna keep it rolling we're gonna keep
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.400]   we're gonna keep this carrie's mic thing rolling man so it's been cool i'm gonna keep going and um
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:50.520]   hopefully y'all keep tuning in

[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   It could be worse.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   Life is hard.

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860]   Six.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.860]   Seven.

[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:34.840]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.960]   Hey, Russ!
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:46.680]   Man, what do we have going on here?
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.820]   A little friendly competition, man.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.480]   He got me yesterday, so I'm trying to get him back today.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.980]   Four seconds.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.140]   Five eight.

[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.040]   Come on, Russ.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.580]   Good.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   Nice.

[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.080]   Let's go.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.580]   Let's go.

[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:38.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   Give me this.

[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   Give me this.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   Give me this.

[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.620]   Nice.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.620]   Backward from the top.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.620]   Backward from the top.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.620]   Nice.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.620]   Jump.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.620]   Easy.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   Easy.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.620]   Uh.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:12.620]   I'm not trying to run around all games.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.620]   I'm not trying to run around all games.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.620]   Legs start to get heavier.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.620]   You can play heavier minutes now.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.620]   Really?
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.620]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.620]   Nah, bro.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.620]   Me and Paul, bro.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620]   What are those, bro?
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.620]   Just got done with a tough workout with my nig, man.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620]   I grabbed one.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.620]   I had to be bro and pig a couple times.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.620]   Beat him in some shooting competitions.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.620]   Oh, wow.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.620]   We capping.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.620]   We capping on the vlog, bro.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.620]   Huh?
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.620]   That's crazy.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.620]   Man, just finished up with my boy Trey in the gym.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620]   Got that good working.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.620]   Got up a lot of jumpers today.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Did some ball handling.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.620]   Just coming off of pick and rolls and different shots off of different actions.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.620]   I love working out with shooters that challenge me as a shooter to get better.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.620]   You know, sometimes when you're just working out by yourself, you don't have to challenge yourself
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.620]   and it can get a little stagnant and get a little boring.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.620]   Um, and a little hard to improve.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.620]   But when you're working out with somebody that's that caliber of a shooter like Trey,
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:08.620]   or like Steph, you know, KD, somebody like that, like you have to lock in.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.620]   So, it was some good work today.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   Um, you know, Trey's been one of my best friends ever since we were young.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.620]   Um, we played AAU together.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   We won a peach championship, EYBL championship together.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.620]   And now to see him doing what he's doing in the league is amazing.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.620]   Um, we were talking about it at the end of our workout.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.620]   It's just crazy to think like he's the best player in the world at that size.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   Like at that height and that weight, you know, he's the best in the world.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.620]   And that's kind of crazy.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.620]   You know, who would have thought when we were coming up that he would be in the position he's in now.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.620]   So, I'm proud of him.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.620]   We're going to continue to get this good work in throughout the, throughout the couple weeks that I'm out here.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.620]   But, uh, yeah man, I'm proud of my boy.
