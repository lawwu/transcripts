[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.720]   It's Friday here at Radical Personal Finance. On Fridays, we do Q&A. Let's get started.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets and
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.440]   I'm your host. Today it's Friday, so we do live Friday Q&A, although this promises to
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.920]   be interesting, doing some things I've never done before. So time to learn and grow, right?
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:58.400]   That's the whole point. One of the things, last couple of weeks I've been getting the
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.000]   results back from your surveys. Some of the results to me were pretty astonishing, but
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920]   a couple of the things were very nice and very gratifying. I learned a lot about who
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.880]   you are as a listening audience. I learned some of the demographics, which have been
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.600]   super, super helpful, and some of it has been a little bit surprising.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.720]   Now a couple of the things that I learned, I don't know if it was surprising or not,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.760]   but one of the things that I learned was just simply that the majority of you who are listening
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.960]   are right in that 25 to 54 age bracket. Most of you make a lot of money and most of you
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.000]   have college educations. The challenge of that scenario of you all making a lot of money
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.200]   and having college educations means that I'm not achieving one of the goals that I have
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.080]   set for myself, which is I've been trying to reach people who are just getting started.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.960]   I've been trying to reach people who are younger, who are poor, et cetera.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.360]   Now I know I'm not going to talk long about that, but as I've been considering that, I
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.600]   realized, well, I don't know that younger people are listening to long format podcasts,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   but they are watching videos. So I'm going to determine to learn how to do video. I've
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   put it off for a long time to simply choosing to focus on audio primarily, but I've decided,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.320]   okay, it's time to do what I can. So of course I'm a minimalist. I try to do as much as I
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.040]   can with minimum equipment and make it work. So I have been putting together a video setup
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.280]   and at the moment I am live streaming. Finally, after threatening it some months ago, I'm
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   live streaming the recording of the show here. I'm live streaming it in the Radical Personal
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   Finance Facebook group. So if you'd like to see this, I intend to do this more often.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   Sometimes I think I'll do it on the page. So if you haven't done it, come on by and
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.900]   like the Radical Personal Finance Facebook page. And sometimes I think that I will do
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.600]   it in the Facebook group. So come on by and join. If you'd like to do the chat with us,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.640]   come on by and join the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group. For those of you who are watching
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.960]   online, thank you. Feel free to interact in the comments and contribute your commentary.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.160]   But all of that said, it obviously makes me very nervous. I get very nervous being on
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.840]   video and when you've got to produce a show and hopefully make sense, give proper financial
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.960]   answers on technical complex topics, do it in an interesting and concise way while recording
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.040]   video and audio, I'm feeling the pressure at the moment. So you'll have to bear with
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.000]   me if we make mistakes. So let's see. Let's go first to... I see Greg is here on my screen.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.120]   Greg from PA. Greg, go ahead and introduce yourself and let me know what you'd like to
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   talk about today, please.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.360]   Hi, Joshua. Can you hear me?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.880]   I can hear you well. Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.560]   That's funny because I'm looking at your face on the computer and your voice here. It's
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.200]   funny. No, I just saw you were doing the live feed, so I jumped right in. I wasn't even
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.920]   thinking about it. So I'm just excited to be here.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.280]   Do you have a question or a topic of conversation?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.960]   Yeah, I can come up with a question. I've got 10 million questions. You know what I've
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.680]   been thinking about lately? Okay, I have three cars and I keep wondering why do I have three
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   cars and one's a good family mover. It's a Toyota 4Runner. One is an electric car that
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.800]   I love and the other is an Acura that's about 10 years old or a little over 10 years old
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.760]   and it gets great glass mileage. I keep thinking, "Boy, each of these cars fits a different
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.360]   need in my life." I could save some money if I got rid of one of them, but then I'm
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.440]   like, "Do I get rid of the 12-year-old Acura?" I don't know. It's something I keep thinking
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.640]   about. Would I save money if I didn't have these three cars, even though I save a lot
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.320]   of money with the Nissan Leaf?
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   So you had two and then you bought the Leaf in order to get the benefit of the cheaper
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   running it with electricity. Is that right?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.880]   Yeah, that's about right. I found it down the street. I was just kind of interested
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.600]   in it and I love that car. It's a lot of fun to drive, but it's just limited on the miles.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.320]   We take off on the weekends and to get to the weekend location sometimes, I just can't
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.280]   do it with that car. For my work as well, I might travel to the next state over and
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.960]   I can't use that car. So I've been holding on to the Acura. It really doesn't owe me
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.280]   any money because I bought it brand new and it's still kicking really well. I don't
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   know.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.140]   So it sounds like this is just kind of a little minor tweak that you're trying to think
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.080]   about making. Is this a small little optimization in your approach and you're trying to figure
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.560]   out how much it's costing you and if it's worth the hassle. Is that right?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.600]   Yeah, I think so. Because for instance, I just did a job and I drove, I don't know,
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.760]   let's say an hour and a half away. And the Acura gets about 38 miles to the gallon when
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.120]   I'm on the highway. So it runs really, really well. But I'm paying the insurance. I'm
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   paying the registration. I just had it inspected just now. So I guess it costs that up. And
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.360]   the one other thing I keep thinking about it, I don't know if you're familiar with
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.040]   this, but in our state, Pennsylvania has insurance that is stacked. So I have it stacked on three
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.560]   cars. So I kind of think I get this benefit from that as well. You know what I'm talking
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   about with that?
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.880]   Where, you mean your coverage is increased or a reduction in rates? How do you mean?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.200]   So I guess in Pennsylvania, you can opt to have your insurance stacked on the multiple
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.800]   vehicles. So if you had say $100,000 in liability insurance, if you stack it and you have three
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   cars now I have $300,000.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   Right. Got it.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.320]   For instance. So I think that's got a great benefit to it as well.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.480]   Well, I mean, obviously this sounds like just more of a fun question than something that
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.680]   you're really struggling with. It's not obviously a huge financial issue for you. I would just
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.640]   calculate the cost. It doesn't sound like any of these cars are worth a lot of money
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.720]   if you sold them, right? Is that accurate?
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.600]   I would say you're correct on there. Yes.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.880]   Okay. So if cars are cheap and they're not worth a lot of money if you sold them, then
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.660]   you're in a situation where it doesn't cost you that much to keep them around in terms
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.400]   of depreciation. So your basic calculation is the gasoline that you put through them,
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.160]   but in the calculation of whether to keep them or not, that's not relevant because you're
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   going to be driving one of them. So we're not talking about driving less. And it comes
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:47.300]   down to repair expenses and cost of insurance. If the cost of insurance is small, which probably
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.720]   sounds like it probably is. So cost of insurance is small. And then also the brands that you
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   have, a Toyota 4Runner and an Acura, which is an Acura is a Honda. These are reliable,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.800]   consistent brands that aren't going to cost all that much money to keep around. In my
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.200]   mind, they're not costing you a ton. The electric car is obviously for fun and to save a little
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.520]   bit of money on gasoline. If you don't need the money and you like having the extra car,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:20.120]   keep it around until you get in the situation where you are frustrated with having to make
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   the repair bills. That's what I would do.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.720]   At the moment, I own four cars. I own too many vans. I own a camper van and I have this
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.640]   little Toyota Corolla that I bought for $500 back in the day. It's just nice to have an
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:39.180]   extra car. I like it because it allows me to help people who are in need in an easier
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.120]   way than other people. It's a little hard to say, "Hey, somebody needs a car and I'm
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.560]   going to give them my primary car." But for me, one of the big reasons I have the Corolla
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.400]   is I can keep that car around. It costs me almost nothing. I've not had to repair anything.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.360]   It's super basic, super simple. The insurance practically doesn't cost anything. Then I
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.120]   can have a car that's easy to lend out and allows me to help other people when they need
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.120]   to.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.360]   If I were you, and absent some compelling reason to get rid of them, and unless you're
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.040]   sure that you just don't want to own one of them, I would keep them around myself.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.400]   All right, let's go on here. Greg, I can come back to you in a little bit if you got another
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.120]   question. I've got a 703 phone number here on my screen. Who's that calling in? Go ahead,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.120]   raise your hand, and introduce yourself.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   That's me. That's Frank.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.200]   Okay, Frank. Yeah, I can hear you great. Go ahead and tell me what's going on. Let's see
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   how I can serve you today.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.440]   I recently met with my insurance person, and he is proposing that I invest in something
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:49.640]   called a modified endowment contract. I don't even know what that is. It's from a company
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   that he used to work for. I'm hoping you can tell me something about it.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.480]   Sure. Let's start with just what is a modified endowment contract. Let me explain that first,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.160]   and then we'll come back to your specifics and see if we can give you any useful advice
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.840]   on it. A modified endowment contract is simply a term that means ... It's a technical IRS
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.960]   term that applies to a life insurance policy. When you own a whole life insurance policy,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.320]   you have as a component of that life insurance policy, you have a death benefit, and you
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:32.000]   also have what's called the inside buildup of cash values. These cash values in the account
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.080]   in the life insurance policy equate to a portion of the reserves that the insurance company
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   has set aside to pay your benefit when you die.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.800]   In times past, one of the great benefits of life insurance is there's no cap on who can
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.120]   buy insurance based upon income. Anybody who wants to buy life insurance, if you make $10
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.920]   million a year, you can buy in and you can buy as much as you want. You can put $1 million
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.400]   a year into the insurance contract. In addition to that, you have the benefit of the fact
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.320]   that these cash values inside the policy build up without being taxed year by year. Cash
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.560]   values inside the policy, you don't pay income tax as those values grow. You don't pay capital
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.400]   gains tax and you don't pay ordinary income tax. This is really valuable, especially because
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   some of the contracts can grow at a pretty decent rate. Generally, life insurance is
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.720]   very stable, but they can grow at a pretty decent rate.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.480]   Now, when you put these two things together, you have an opportunity for people who are
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.080]   wealthy to say, "Hey, I've got something of a tax shelter here and I can buy a lot of
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:48.800]   it." You have the possibility that wealthy people will take advantage of this tax shelter.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.160]   That's what traditionally has happened in the life insurance marketplace. Lots of people
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.960]   would put lots of money into these life insurance contracts.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.800]   I forget when it was. Was it during the '80s? That's what my guess would be, but I'm not
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.360]   very confident in that date. A few decades ago, the IRS changed the rules and they created
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:16.720]   something called a modified endowment contract. They said that if you were in a situation
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.760]   where you put too much money into this contract, you're obviously just using it as a tax shelter.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.880]   It's not actually a life insurance policy. The whole point of the tax code was that they
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.120]   wanted it to be for a life insurance policy, not as a tax shelter.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.600]   They have a rule. The rule is that you can't put more money into the premium than is required
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.800]   to buy a certain type of policy in under seven years. You have to fund the policy for at
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:48.400]   least seven years. The way this gets applied in the world of life insurance is if you buy
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.280]   a life insurance contract wherein the premiums are paid off in fewer than seven years, so
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.040]   examples here would be if you buy a single premium life insurance policy, you give the
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.880]   insurance company $100,000 and they say, "Hey, here's a $400,000 policy," that would become
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.400]   a modified endowment contract. If you pay the policy in anything less than seven years,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.720]   so you pay it for premiums for five years and then you quit paying, that would be a
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.400]   modified endowment contract.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:23.240]   If you put yourself in a situation where you put too much money into it and you pay more
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.720]   premiums than what would be required to pay the policy off in seven years, under that
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.520]   situation, you turn the policy into a modified endowment contract. The problem with a modified
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:39.040]   endowment contract is it loses the ability to get the money out without paying taxes.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.360]   Let me explain that. You don't lose any tax benefits on the death benefit. All life insurance
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:53.320]   policies are always received by the beneficiary without paying any income taxes of any kind.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.420]   That's the same no matter what. All life insurance policies are always received, proceeds are
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.520]   always received by the beneficiary without any income taxes. But the owner of a contract
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.720]   has the ability to take money out of the contract as a loan, an advance of cash values. When
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.000]   the owner of the contract takes money out of the policy as a loan, an advance of cash
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.920]   values, they can take that money out under what's technically considered to be an advance
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.560]   of death benefit. They can take that money out and they can receive it without paying
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.160]   income taxes in the current year.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.400]   What a modified endowment contract does is it cancels that benefit and it cancels also
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.140]   the benefit of what's called FIFO, first in, first out, which is another benefit of a life
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.940]   insurance contract. You can put in premiums into a life insurance policy and let's say
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.220]   you've contributed $50,000 of premiums and then you now have $100,000 of cash value in
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.300]   the contract and let's say your death benefit is $250,000. Well, under the terms of the
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.940]   tax code, you can always take out the premiums that you've put in and you don't incur any
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.100]   tax. So you could take out 50 grand. It's not a loan. It's just a distribution and that
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.420]   comes to you tax-free under the first in, first out rules. Well, when the policy becomes
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.420]   a modified endowment contract, that goes away.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.740]   So all of that to say, that's what a modified endowment contract is and it's not necessarily
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:21.080]   a problem. It just might be a problem in application. It's not a problem if you're buying a policy
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.140]   for death benefit. It might not be a problem depending on the application of the policy.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.460]   It is a problem if you're trying to buy the life insurance policy for the death benefit,
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:38.760]   but you're also hoping to get the benefit of the tax favored distribution of cash values.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.900]   So Frank, that's the technical answer. Hopefully I didn't make you go to sleep. Tell me more
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.780]   about the actual situation and why you're considering purchasing such a contract intentionally.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:54.020]   Well, I'm not. I'm wondering why he proposed it. I'm going to meet with him again and try
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.340]   to find out, but I first wanted to know what it was.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.940]   Are you sure that he proposed a modified endowment contract as a good solution for you?
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:09.420]   Yeah, he emailed me the form and the illustration and the whole bit.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.540]   So hold on one second though, because sometimes, did he say in the contract, did he say that
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.660]   it's a modified endowment contract, or was that just written on the illustration?
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:25.340]   Oh no, it's written. I mean, I open it up and it says, "Modified endowment contract."
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:31.740]   What is it and why should I purchase one? And then it's followed by an illustration.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:38.260]   So what you're telling me is it sounds like it is essentially a whole life policy, but
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:45.820]   without some of the tax benefits that such a policy would ordinarily qualify for if it
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.940]   was done in a certain way.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:54.580]   No, I don't think that's what's happening here. Let me explain. If this life insurance
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.540]   agent is proposing to you the purchase of a whole life insurance policy, they are probably
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:07.040]   proposing it to you for the death benefit, but also as a place for you to accumulate
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.380]   some cash within the cash values.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:16.120]   So when you're proposing that and you're designing a life insurance contract, one of the key
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.540]   things that the agent is trying to do is they're trying to make that policy accumulate cash
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.180]   very efficiently. One of the problems with life insurance policies for the purpose of
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:31.620]   cash accumulation is that you have to deal with large costs of insurance. After all,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.420]   there's a death benefit, and that's the cost of insurance. That's a feature that a straight
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.660]   up investment doesn't have. When you go and you buy a mutual fund, you don't have to also
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.820]   pay for the proceeds of a life insurance policy out of it, but in a whole life insurance policy
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.940]   you do.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.620]   So in order to increase the cash values, what is common in the life insurance business is
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.220]   to add what are called additional premiums to the contract. So if you were to look at
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.820]   that life insurance illustration from the insurance company, you would find on there
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:06.180]   most likely, let's say, about how much of annual premiums is the proposal for?
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:13.180]   This is, let's see, insurance $1 million, annual premium out like $40,000. Yeah, that's
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.100]   what it is.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.380]   So he's proposing, or the illustration is for a $40,000 annual premium. Now on that
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   contract, when you look at that, if you look down somewhere on it, it'll tell you what
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.540]   the base amount of the insurance is. Depending on your age, let's just say this base amount
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.940]   of insurance, the cost of that is $15,000 or $20,000.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.740]   Let's just say $20,000.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   It's $800,000 in the upper right hand corner. So the base amount, $800,000, additional protection,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.900]   $200,000.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.140]   But what's the premium? It'll be down at the bottom of the page usually.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.900]   Annual premium?
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.060]   Yes, down at the bottom. So let me just talk you through it because I don't want to get
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.140]   on the show here, I don't want to publicly get into too much of an illustration, but
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.520]   I'll just tell you what's on a page like that. Down at the bottom, underneath the rows of
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.180]   numbers, you'll see at the bottom where it'll show you somewhere, it'll show you the base
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.940]   premium. And so the base, it might be at the top or it might be at the bottom, but it'll
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   show you the base premium. And the base premium is probably in the range of $20,000 for some
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.420]   amount might be whole life insurance, some amount might be a term insurance component
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.000]   of that. And if you add all that together, let's just say for sake of illustration here
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.260]   that it's $20,000 per year.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260]   But what the agent...
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.080]   Maybe this will help. It says the contract premium is $40,000 including 16,864 additional
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   premium.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   Exactly. So that's exactly what it is. So under your situation, the annual contract
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.320]   premium is $40,000 and $16,000, I'm just going to use round numbers for the sake of audio,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.920]   $16,000 of that is additional premium. Now under whole life insurance, which is different
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.580]   than universal life insurance, those are optional dollars. That's money that is optional, it
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.420]   doesn't have to go into the contract. The reason it's there is because that money goes
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.140]   directly to the cash values of the contract and it bypasses the cost of insurance. And
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:12.300]   so the agent is putting that on there in order to help the cash value and the policy grow
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.140]   more quickly in the early years and also to grow more quickly, hopefully over the long
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:24.540]   term. And so the base premium of the contract is $24,000 per year. That's the actual cost
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.580]   of the insurance. That's the minimum that you can pay for that size of insurance policy
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:35.760]   at your age. But they have in there an extra $16,000 of additional premiums. And so that
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.780]   additional premiums that bypasses agent commissions, it bypasses cost of insurance and it goes
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.020]   right to the cash values.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.140]   The problem is this, you can't do that forever. So on your policy illustration, it will show
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.040]   you a year that it becomes a modified endowment contract. So it'll say somewhere, "This policy
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.900]   will become a modified endowment contract in year," probably something like year 15,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.620]   year 20. Do you see a number or a statement like that anywhere in the illustration?
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.460]   Let's see here. Would it be in the rows of years?
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.340]   Probably be at the top. Depends on the company.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.820]   Yeah, modified endowment as a policy year 17.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.740]   Okay, right. So now what they're saying is that this contract becomes a modified endowment
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:23.100]   contract at year 17. But anytime before that, it's not a modified endowment contract. And
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.500]   what the agent is going to propose to you is they're going to propose to you that you
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.440]   stop paying the premiums before year 17, or that you at least remove those additional
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:41.020]   premiums before year 17. Because the computer is calculating that at that point in time,
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:48.020]   you're going to reach that MEC limit, that line in the contract, at which point if you
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.940]   go beyond that, you're in a situation where you've put too much money into it.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.420]   So what they will do is they'll give you, they sent you an illustration that shows you
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:01.580]   paying premiums for all of the years. But during your consultation or during the actual
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.460]   next stage of the sales process, they're going to give you an illustration that shows you
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.100]   stopping payments probably at year 15 or year 17, or reducing at least the additional premiums.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.140]   And they're going to show you how that contract does it. The reason in the attachment it says
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.500]   this is what a modified endowment contract is, is because in order to cover themselves,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.100]   the insurance company puts in the quoting software, it forces that disclosure page to
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:36.460]   be in there any time a proposal is run by the computer system. So that's why it's in
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.060]   there on that page.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:44.320]   Now, probably the next question you're saying, is this a good thing or is this a bad thing?
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.820]   How old are you now, Frank?
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.180]   Frank - 50, how old am I? 52.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.780]   Okay, so they're going to be proposing this that it ends at 65 or 67. That's why they've
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.940]   done it, is so that when you stop working, that you can schedule the life insurance premiums
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.900]   to stop being paid. And they're trying to build a policy that is big and that is efficient
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:10.660]   for your goals or for whatever you express to them or whatever they are identifying as
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.980]   saying, "Hey, we think Frank is going to like this." There's nothing wrong with that. All
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:25.460]   of my whole life insurance policies that I own are built in order for the premiums to
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.060]   be done. This is called in the insurance angle, this is called quick pay, where the goal is
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.140]   to quick pay the policy. So I want to put the money in pretty quickly up front, and
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.460]   then I want to be able to stop at a certain point in time. And depending on your age,
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:44.660]   this may or may not be a good thing. But for you, I'm sure this rep is thinking about,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.300]   "Hey, when Frank retires, I want to tell him that he doesn't need to keep putting money
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.660]   into it." Make sense?
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:58.740]   Okay. Yeah, no, that does make sense. And I see, yeah, that they sent me multiple PDFs,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:05.660]   and one of them does have a cutoff. The next one I'm looking at, the first one did not.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:11.820]   Okay. No, I really, I literally opened this up and I said, "Why are you not interested
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.140]   in this?" Why do I have somebody who doesn't know what to do?
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.660]   Well, that's what I'm here. It's interesting. Life insurance is the worst. In some ways,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.940]   it's the best sales process. In other ways, it's the worst sales process. And it's the
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:35.140]   worst because there's so much technical information. And the life insurance agent has to simplify
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.060]   it enough to really make sense. But then they also have to be thorough enough to cover the
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:45.900]   legal and the technical requirements for disclosure. And it's a real hassle because those illustrations
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:52.580]   that life insurance agents send out are the worst. And what you got in terms of an emailed
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:58.180]   thing when I was an agent, I used to hate sending those out because it's charts and
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.100]   charts and columns of numbers. And the problem is it's important. It's important disclosures
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.740]   for the prospective client because they need to know how things are going to work. That's
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.420]   the data that they need for analysis. But nobody understands how that stuff works. So
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.900]   hopefully you'll feel a little bit better equipped to understand what a modified endowment
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.620]   contract is and you can have a more productive conversation.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.300]   Anything else before I go on to the next caller?
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   No, no. Go ahead. Go to the next one.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:34.060]   Awesome. Let's see here. I've got an 847 number from Illinois. Go ahead, please, and introduce
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.660]   yourself and let me know how I can serve you, please.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.020]   Hi, Josh. It's David from St. Louis. I had to hang up earlier.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.380]   No problem, David. Go ahead and let us know what your question is.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:49.140]   All right. So I sit on a board at my church that manages trust, and a very nice member
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:56.540]   when they passed away left us $90,000 in cash and $320,000 in what I've been told before
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:02.060]   our first meeting is everything. Mutual funds, stocks, bonds, everything. So I'm not really
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:07.380]   sure how moving money around works for churches, and I know they're looking for this to be
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.900]   a long-term thing where they can kind of draw down 5% every year. That's their goal on paper
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:21.260]   right now. If Joshua Sheets joined my church, what would he do?
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.800]   So there's two answers to that. There's the philosophical answer of what would be an appropriate
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.060]   way for a church to handle money, which is kind of an interesting theological and philosophical
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.040]   question. Then there's the practical financial planning question, which is probably in some
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.860]   ways more straightforward. Let's try to tackle the technical one first, and then you can
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.600]   see if you want to talk about--let's go back to philosophical. Do you know what form the
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:56.140]   money is--so you received a bequest. The member died, and they left the money to the church.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:01.380]   Was the money left in the context of a trust, or was the money just simply left in a beneficiary
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.940]   arrangement on these different accounts?
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.180]   I believe it is a trust. I know we're going to exit it through Charles Schwab, and then
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.500]   we're free to move the money around however we want. And we haven't met yet for the first
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.820]   time, so that's all I know at this point.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.300]   So without your having more information, I can't give you much useful information in
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.260]   terms of what's actually going to happen. So let me give you the questions that you
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:37.060]   need to ask. With this person leaving the money as a trust doesn't tell us anything.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.340]   There could be various types of trusts. For example, this could be a trust that they've
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.260]   established for the benefit of the trust, and it's a trust that they have an independent
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.280]   trustee who's going to handle. And what they've decided is that the trustee is going to distribute
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:59.500]   5% of the assets to the church each year on an ongoing basis until the money is used up.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.060]   And if that is how it's arranged, then you as a church, you have no decisions to make
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.460]   in the matter. There's nothing that you need to do. You can't make any investment decisions.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.180]   There's not anything that you guys are going to be responsible for. If that's the actual
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:20.340]   situation, then you just simply cash the checks and put them into the general operating fund
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.020]   and move on with your life. It also could have been left with an actual trust that was
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:33.260]   set up for you to, let me just think for a moment, it could be set up as a trust where
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.100]   you take over as a participant in the trust in some way. Maybe you're a trustee. Well,
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.780]   if you take over as a trustee and you're a participant in the trust, then of course you
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.220]   would have to make those decisions. But you don't have any information to know that today
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:53.060]   is going to be relevant to your decision. I do know that we will be able to move the
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.660]   money around because there's one guy on the board who said, "Well, the stock market's
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.740]   an all-time high, a bunch of it in stocks. So the moment we assume control of it, sell
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:09.340]   everything and set it down somewhere." Okay. So, yeah, so it could just be left to you.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:14.660]   Well, in that situation, then basically the technical answer doesn't matter. It goes down
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   to the philosophy. What is the best use of it? And here you got to handle the investments
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.780]   of it. Is this particular member right? Is the stock market at an all-time high? And
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.740]   then you've got to answer the philosophical question of what's the best way to use money?
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:39.420]   Is it a good idea for a church to keep large sums of investment money aside, or is it good
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.460]   that that money be spent quickly? So let's skip the market answer because that answer
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:49.700]   will be highly dependent upon the advice that you get, the philosophy that you have. What
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:58.060]   do you think should be done with the money? Well, I do know we've been giving has been
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.780]   sort of down for the last few years. So there was a thought that this would almost plug
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.180]   in kind of the budget gap if we were drawing it down a little bit every year. So then in
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.300]   that sense, I understand and agree with, well, if we can hold this sum of money and use this
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.460]   to kind of fill in some of the gaps, you know, for maintenance around the church and for
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.220]   programs and things like that, that's not a terrible use of it for the life of the church.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.180]   I agree with you overall in the greater scheme of things, yeah, it would be better to send
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.900]   a hundred missionaries somewhere or something like that. But for the day-to-day life of
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:32.100]   the church, I can kind of see where the majority of people say, yeah, we'd like to draw down
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.220]   over the period of years a certain amount of money to help plug in a budget gap. Are
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:43.420]   some people lobbying for the money to be kept as a fund, an endowment fund, that can be
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.900]   drawn down more slowly? Yeah, yeah, that is the initial thought before we go into the
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.660]   meeting, that it would be, yeah, 5% drawn down every year to kind of help with the church
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:01.700]   budgeting. And what benefit are they trying to get out of that? I'm sorry, I don't understand
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.460]   the question. So why are they wanting to do that? Why do they think it's a good idea,
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.100]   philosophically, for a church to have a sum of money that they're taking an investment
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.100]   return off of? Ah, I suspect that trustees are looking at, we've had a few years of red
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.060]   ink and they're thinking that this is, you know, literally, you know, a manna from heaven
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:27.660]   or a gift from God, and that this would kind of help sustain the church while we look at
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.900]   other priorities or budget problems, or we see, you know, maybe it was giving just down
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.180]   for a few years and then it picks back up and then we can do, this doesn't close all
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.660]   the doors, now we have options to disperse the money onto larger projects, scholarships,
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:48.740]   or things like that. Well, so that's a philosophical question that you've got to answer from scripture
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.340]   and in discussion. It's not a technical financial planning question. I'll tell you my opinion,
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:02.980]   just in case it sparks some discussion. If you put me in that boardroom, I would be lobbying
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:09.500]   against keeping any kind of endowment fund. I don't think it's a good idea for, especially
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:15.140]   a church institution, but even most institutions, to try to maintain the idea of keeping large
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.500]   amounts of money on an ongoing basis, and I'll tell you why. Especially with churches,
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:24.060]   and this is something that people who are involved in churches, assuming this is a Christian
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.860]   church, one of the basic understandings of a Christian church is that the Christian God
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.340]   is a God who is living and actively involved in the world. And so that means that he's
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.920]   living and actively involved in money. And you want to make sure that all of your actions
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.820]   and that your decisions actually reflect that. So, I wouldn't be seeking to try to set up
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:52.580]   an institution that can function without the active involvement of the people. And in a
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.700]   church environment, the church is not here for its own self-enrichment. The church is
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.500]   not here to say, "Look how great we are, look at how big, fancy buildings, look how wonderful
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:10.140]   we are." The church is a living organism. It's a body of people who are involved, and
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:15.660]   if you bring that together and you just say, "We've got an external sum of money," you
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.140]   miss that. And churches are going to grow, they're going to decline, and God's not scared
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.380]   to let a church die. And so you don't want to try to prop something up. I think what
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.900]   should be done with the money is you should look and say, "What are the biggest, most
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.220]   pressing needs that we see right now that we can use this money to contribute to?" That
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.860]   doesn't mean that you turn around and say, "This week and this month, we're going to
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.260]   try to get rid of it as quickly as we can and buy a bunch of useless stuff." That's
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:46.220]   not the point. But the church should have, "Here are the priorities, here are the opportunities
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:53.580]   for it." And the goal should be, "How can we steward the money over the short term and
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:34:01.860]   get rid of it into the biggest return?" And if a church doesn't have a better return for
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:07.780]   their money than the stock market, I've lost all confidence and faith in that church. I
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:13.860]   mean, the number of options that are available to multiply the money is so much bigger under
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.300]   the stewardship of a local church. I mean, it's incomprehensible to me that we wouldn't
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.500]   have a list of those things that we're focusing on. Why would we be considering the stock
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.260]   market? We should have so many more opportunities that are there to make exponential returns.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:40.180]   And I'm talking about financial, but even just in terms of impact. $420,000 is a substantial
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:46.740]   sum of money that can make a dramatic difference in some local projects. But when you'd say
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:53.820]   $21,000 per year is a basically inconsequential amount of money that's not really going to
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:00.820]   make a big difference on an ongoing basis. So I personally wouldn't say, obviously, we
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.300]   don't want to be good stewards of it, not waste the money. But the goal should be over
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.580]   the coming years, as in fewer than five, we're going to invest this money and get rid of
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:15.500]   it back out into something that's going to be a much better return. I think it's a problem.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   It's a real, in terms of charitable giving, if I had given that money, I would actually
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.100]   stipulate that the money needs to be gone within a certain amount of time. Maybe it's
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:30.460]   a decade, maybe it's five years. But institutions, especially institutions that are arranged
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:36.100]   under a religious cause, under a religious banner, or under some sort of charitable philosophical
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:42.820]   banner, institutions run the risk of being hijacked by people down the road. And you
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.940]   can see this in every major institution I've ever studied, every large charitable organization,
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.500]   every large university. The universities and the institutions change over time. And the
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.460]   original founders to the Harvard endowment might or might not be very happy with what's
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:03.140]   going on at Harvard today. And so I think it's important to me, when I'm giving money,
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.300]   I want to make sure the money is gone in a relatively short period of time, because I
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.500]   don't want an institution to be created, especially a church. I don't want a church that can continue
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   functioning without God. And that can happen when you pile up big coffers full of money.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.220]   God left years ago, but yet the people keep going because there's money. And I think the
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.340]   same thing applies to other charitable institutions. So that's a pretty strong, and I don't know
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:32.460]   how usual or unusual philosophical opinion that is, but I think that plans should be
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:38.300]   relatively short term rather than longer term. What say you?
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.500]   That was part of the reason why I called, I love it, when you weave Scripture and theology
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.780]   into your talks, because I think that's very refreshing and something that's generally
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.300]   lacking, that's why I support the show. I think it would definitely be something that,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.940]   yeah, in the next couple of weeks I'll look into, yeah, projects around the area that
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.380]   certainly, because it's north St. Louis County, we might have--may or may not have been in
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:06.460]   the news recently in years--that certainly we could do something better and, dare I say,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.740]   kinder with the money than, yeah, just kind of drawing it down like a church's IRA, kind
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:17.220]   of symbolically. So, yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate that very much, and I think, yeah, maybe that's
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.420]   God's way of telling us, "Hey, the value's so high, why are you going to sit here and
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.260]   mess around it, pull all the cash out, and let's do something with it?"
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:31.100]   I think your most powerful way to compare this is going to be, what impact does $420,000
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:37.820]   of cash make versus what impact does $21,000 a year make? $21,000 a year, how many people
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.820]   are in this church?
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:44.220]   Oh, it's a good medium-sized church, 200, 250, somewhere around there.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   Okay, so with this size of church, I mean, $21,000 can be fritted away in health insurance
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:57.860]   and painting the buildings and stuff like that. This is not going to make an impact,
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.940]   and I think if the original member who left the money behind, if I were the member, I
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.500]   would have stipulated, or if I were advising the member, I would have stipulated that they
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:12.860]   specifically think through an actual project or an impact. $21,000 will quickly get lost
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.500]   in administration, and that's one of the major problems that churches face. I mean, even
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:22.140]   earlier you mentioned it in almost a kind of a reactionary defensive way of, "Well,
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.220]   we need these maintenance things done. We need to buy paint," et cetera. But this happens
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.420]   all the time, is that churches get together and they say, "Well, we've got to keep
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.860]   ourselves going," and they're concerned for their own self-preservation, and they're
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:38.100]   not concerned for their impact. And so, yes, maybe the buildings do need to be painted,
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.220]   and maybe the money should be used, some of it should be used for that. I'm not the
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:50.020]   one to say. You guys have to decide that together. But in terms of impact, $420,000 is enough
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:58.340]   to maybe launch a project, launch a ministry organization, support somebody who needs support.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:08.140]   $420,000 is enough to make a major contribution to something specific, whereas $21,000 a year
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.260]   can quickly get swallowed up in a bloated budget. So I would approach it on that perspective,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.340]   and if I were the donor, I would have stipulated that just in terms of impact. So you've got
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.060]   to take that and see what you actually think about it. But since you called my show, that's
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.060]   my opinion.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.980]   Great, great. That's what I was looking for. Josh, I really appreciate you taking time
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.740]   to talk to me today. Love the show.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:36.980]   For sure, man. Wasn't expecting to talk about my philosophy on churches and charitable giving,
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.900]   but I guess that's what you get when you do a show like this. Thank you all so much for
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:46.380]   listening, and for those of you who have called in. It's certainly a challenging situation
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.820]   for me, but we had several new callers who joined in from the Radical Personal Finance
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.860]   Facebook group. If you'd like to get on a call like this next week, jump on as a patron
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.180]   of the show. These calls, at the moment I've reserved them exclusively for patrons. Just
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:08.660]   decided as a special thing to go ahead and I just decided to include the Radical Personal
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.460]   Finance Facebook group today, so that was where a couple of the callers were. And for
