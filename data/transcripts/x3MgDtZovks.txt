[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.220]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.980]   Today, my guest is Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.180]   Dr. Susanna Soberg completed her doctoral thesis work
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120]   at the Center of Inflammation and Metabolism
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.200]   and the Center for Physical Activity Research
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.880]   at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   Her research has focused on how deliberate cold exposure
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.700]   and deliberate heat exposure
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.160]   can be used to enhance human metabolism.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.640]   She is the first author of a seminal study
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640]   which discovered the minimum thresholds
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.220]   for deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.920]   for increasing brown fat thermogenesis,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.220]   which is essentially a mode of increasing heat production
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.120]   and metabolism in the body,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   and for establishing actionable protocols
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.240]   that can be used outside of the laboratory
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.560]   to improve metabolism and human health.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.760]   Dr. Soberg's research was published in the journal
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.700]   Cell Reports Metabolism in 2021,
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.600]   adding to a long and important history of research
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.560]   focusing on the role of cold and the role of heat
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.640]   in altering various aspects of the body's physiology,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000]   including hormone health, metabolism,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   and changes in neurotransmitters
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.000]   such as dopamine and epinephrine.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.200]   In fact, today's discussion with Dr. Soberg
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.840]   focuses on the role of deliberate heat
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.160]   and deliberate cold exposure on metabolism,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.720]   but it also includes discussion of the effects of cold
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.940]   and heat on things like neurotransmitter production,
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.920]   namely dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   the so-called catecholamines,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280]   which strongly impact mood and metabolism.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.180]   In addition, Dr. Soberg answers many common questions
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.460]   about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure,
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880]   including, for instance, the difference between cold showers
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.460]   versus cold immersion up to the neck
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.820]   versus total body cold immersion,
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.100]   including whether or not going back and forth
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.040]   between heat and cold changes fundamentally
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.480]   the way that heat and cold impact the metabolism,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   hormones, and neurotransmitter production.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.120]   And we talk about almost every single nuance and variation
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   on deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure protocols
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.600]   as it relates to the underlying science,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.880]   in particular, how cold receptors
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.660]   at the level of the skin are impacted
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.320]   versus cold reception and perception
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200]   at the level of the brain
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.940]   and how all of that impacts systems of the brain and body
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.260]   relating to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.720]   Based on her scientific research
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.320]   and academic training,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160]   as well as her understanding and use of deliberate heat
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.380]   and deliberate cold exposure protocols,
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.160]   Dr. Soberg is considered one of the world's leading experts
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   on these topics.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.260]   In fact, she is the author of a recent book
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.200]   entitled "Winter Swimming,"
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.520]   which is, I have to say, a terrific book
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.560]   because it breaks down chapter by chapter
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.400]   the different aspects of deliberate heat and deliberate cold
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.760]   into its various constituent parts,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.220]   including cold acclimatization, the cold shock response,
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.140]   dangers and safeties of cold water,
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.000]   the impact of cold and the impact of heat
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.620]   on various aspects of human health,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.180]   as well as specifics relating to sauna
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.360]   versus ice versus cold swimming, showers, et cetera.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.680]   It's a very thorough read
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.920]   and a very easy and accessible read
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740]   that if you are interested in deliberate cold
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.580]   or deliberate heat exposure or both,
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.160]   will allow you to embrace those protocols
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.860]   with the greatest degree of confidence
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.240]   that you're going to obtain the specific endpoints
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.080]   that you're interested in and to do so safely.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.720]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.300]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.140]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.400]   to the general public.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.460]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.300]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.480]   Our first sponsor is Plunge.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.940]   Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.720]   at-home self-cooling cold plunge
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.600]   for deliberate cold exposure.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960]   I've talked numerous times on this podcast
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.500]   about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.020]   and indeed, today's episode is focused entirely
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.520]   on the benefits and the science of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.540]   Plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.700]   and sanitation unit to give you access
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.120]   to deliberate cold exposure in clean water
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   whenever you want.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.800]   As we will discuss during today's episode
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.560]   with Dr. Susanna Soberg, deliberate cold exposure,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.000]   especially deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.360]   done up to the neck in water,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.660]   can be used to achieve a number of important endpoints
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.120]   related to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.620]   I've been using a plunge for more than two years now.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.760]   I can tell you that it makes it very easy
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.160]   to get your deliberate cold exposure at home.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.560]   It doesn't require much cleaning.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   In fact, it's very easy to keep clean, which is essential.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.280]   You don't want bacteria and other things
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.580]   growing in your cold plunge.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.180]   Basically, everything about the plunge is made easy
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.160]   so that anyone, including myself,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   can get their deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.440]   on a regular basis at home.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.940]   If you're interested in getting a plunge,
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.120]   you can go to Plunge,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.760]   spelled P-L-U-N-G-E, .com/huberman
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.260]   and get $150 off your cold plunge.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.560]   Again, that's plunge.com/huberman for $150 off.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.680]   which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.900]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.420]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.460]   building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.480]   to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   The solution they built
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.900]   turns the proliferation of an invasive species
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.040]   into a wide range of nutrients-dense products,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.240]   from butcher cuts and organ meats to bone broth and jerky.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.880]   Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams of protein
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.020]   per 100 calories.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.380]   Several guests on this podcast
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.860]   who are experts in nutrition
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.420]   have pointed to the value of getting
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.820]   at least one gram of quality protein
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.140]   per pound of body weight each day.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.200]   With Maui Nui, that's very easy to do
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.460]   while eating delicious meals
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.860]   and getting it from a sustainable source.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.660]   If you would like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.780]   go to MauinuiVenison.com/huberman
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.800]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.900]   Again, that's MauinuiVenison.com/huberman
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.540]   to get 20% off.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.460]   Thesis makes custom nootropics,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.880]   and nootropics is not a word that I like
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.400]   because it means smart drugs,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.700]   and the brain doesn't have neural circuits for being smart,
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.380]   rather has neural circuits for focus,
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.060]   neural circuits for task switching,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.660]   neural circuits for creativity, and on and on.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.540]   Thesis understands this and designs custom nootropics
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.420]   designed to get your brain and body into a specific state
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.260]   in order to do the mental and/or physical work
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.360]   that's important to you,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.140]   such as creativity or focus or clarity.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.760]   If you'd like to try Thesis nootropics,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.340]   you simply go to their website,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.720]   you fill out a brief quiz,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.240]   and they will design a custom starter pack
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.200]   so that you can assess which things work for you
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.300]   more or less well,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.640]   and then they'll iterate with you
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.540]   over the course of the next few weeks or months
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.800]   to come up with the ideal nootropic kit for your needs.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.720]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.760]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.080]   You can take that three-minute quiz,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.840]   and they'll send you four different formulas
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.920]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.680]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.380]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout

[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.320]   I'm pleased to announce that I will be hosting
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   two live events in September of 2023.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.280]   The first live event will take place
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.440]   in Toronto on September 12th.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.840]   The second live event will take place in Chicago
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.480]   on September 28th.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.520]   Both live events will include a lecture
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.920]   and a question and answer period
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.220]   and are entitled "The Brain-Body Contract,"
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.560]   during which I will discuss tools and science
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.240]   related to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.720]   And I should mention that a lot of that content
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.420]   will have absolutely no overlap
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.760]   with content covered previously
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.960]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast or elsewhere.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.120]   If you're interested in attending
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.660]   either or both of these events,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.620]   please go to hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.800]   and enter the code HUBERMAN to get early access to tickets.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.680]   Once again, that's hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.260]   and use the code HUBERMAN to access tickets.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.800]   I hope to see you there.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.420]   Dr. Susanna Soberg, welcome.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.260]   - Thank you.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.500]   - So great to have you here.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.640]   I feel like I should give a little bit of the backstory
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.320]   of how we got connected,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.780]   which was that for many years,
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.460]   I've been interested in cold thermogenesis.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.560]   It was the topic of my senior thesis in college.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.320]   And I've, of course, followed the popularity of Wim Hof.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.540]   And we've had Dr. Craig Heller,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.120]   my colleague from biology department at Stanford
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.280]   who works on cold and its impact on physiology
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.120]   and sports performance.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   So for a long time, I've been interested in this area,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   but there's been a real lack of new,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   let's say high profile quality scientific information
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   in terms of how, for instance, cold plunges and sauna,
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.800]   how that impacts human physiology.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.440]   I know there's been some information out there,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.200]   but it's been sort of scattered.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   And then a little over a year ago, I see this paper
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.840]   in Cell Reports Medicine and was immediately struck the,
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.140]   first of all, the fact that it was in Cell Reports Medicine,
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.120]   I've been on the Cell Press editorial board
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.000]   for a long time now.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.240]   So press journals are, of course, phenomenal journals.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   And the title and the content of the paper
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.560]   was directly in line with the sorts of practices
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.340]   that people are very curious about
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.400]   and then are starting to emerge,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.640]   things like sauna, cold plunges.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.000]   And there was your name first on the author list.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.480]   And I reached out to you through social media
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.220]   and we've done a little bit of live content there together.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.660]   And I've been tracking what you've been doing in the world
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.640]   in terms of your book and talking about the results
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   in your manuscript and talking about the science
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.600]   and impact of deliberate cold exposure and sauna.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.260]   And I have to say that it's been a wonderful
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.600]   and remarkable thing to see.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.140]   And you're bringing so much quality information
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.500]   about this area that for a long time,
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.560]   I think was kind of niche and is now becoming
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.740]   more and more mainstream.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.000]   So I'm going to start off with a thank you for being here
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.640]   and a thank you for the work that you've done.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.740]   And I'm looking forward to talking to you about it today.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.300]   So my first question to get things started
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.100]   is what is happening when we get into
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.700]   an uncomfortably cold environment?
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.060]   So for instance, if I'm really hot on a hot day,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.920]   jumping into a cold pool feels really good.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.700]   But if I'm already kind of at room temperature,
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.800]   I'm a little bit chilly,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.740]   getting into that same temperature of water
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.160]   doesn't feel so good, right?
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.400]   There's a shock there.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.340]   So if you could just walk us through what happens
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.940]   when we get into uncomfortably cold water,
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.540]   whether or not it's by way of shower or cold plunge
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.280]   at the level of our physiology
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.700]   and if you'd like our psychology,
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.300]   I think that's a good place for us to start
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.100]   because I think it will orient people
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.360]   to their own experience if they do that.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.300]   And for those that haven't done it
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.820]   might start to peel back some of the layers
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.120]   as to what the underlying mechanisms of cold are.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.980]   - Yeah, thank you for that question.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.560]   It's really good to just address what actually happens
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.260]   in our physiology when we get cold.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.920]   And you can get cold in many ways.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.540]   So you can just head out for the one that gives you
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.060]   the most potent stressor,
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.400]   which is submerging into cold water.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.760]   And, but you could also go in outside in the cold wind.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.720]   That's also gonna activate your sympathetic nervous system.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.660]   So get all these neurotransmitter going in your body
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.940]   and so your catecholamines.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.780]   Let's just address that we are taking
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.380]   a cold plunge, for example.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.140]   So if you are very hot, for example,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.660]   before you go into the cold water,
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.380]   it's gonna feel less stressful,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.620]   but the temperature difference from your skin to the cold
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.200]   is definitely gonna give you a shock,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.300]   but your core temperature is warmer
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.220]   and that's gonna feel a little bit better.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.660]   So that's why when people go into a sauna, for example,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.480]   and go out then into the cold water,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   they can do it easier than if they were cold beforehand.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.620]   - Could I just ask you a few questions?
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.620]   So you mentioned the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.300]   which for people listening who aren't familiar with that
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.420]   is that the branch of our nervous system
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.060]   that's responsible for creating accelerations
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.900]   in heart rates, feelings of alertness,
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.800]   it's accompanied with stress and the stress response,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.580]   but it's accompanied with waking up in the morning
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.420]   for that matter.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.580]   So it's not always about stress.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.080]   And then you mentioned the catecholamines,
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.420]   which are dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.260]   So maybe a little bit later,
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.500]   we'll talk about those individual neurotransmitters,
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.420]   but you raise a really important point,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.260]   which is something I get asked about a lot
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.200]   for people that are curious
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.060]   about using deliberate cold exposure,
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.540]   which is how cold should the water be?
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.540]   And I know it's very hard
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.300]   to give a straight prescription for that
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.460]   because I think it boils down to what you just said,
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.240]   which is it's really the difference
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.660]   between your current temperature
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.500]   and really the temperature of the surface of your skin
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.560]   and the temperature of the water.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.440]   So if you're very warm, getting into cold feels good.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.540]   If you're already cold,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.920]   getting into more cold feels stressful.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.800]   Is there any way that we can start to gauge
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.220]   what is the best way to approach
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.660]   a deliberate cold exposure protocol?
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.200]   I mean, should it feel uncomfortable?
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.820]   And that leads into the question
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.100]   of how do we balance the discomfort
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.060]   with the amount of time that we spend in?
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.220]   So for instance, if it's just a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.020]   will spending more time in the cold
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.100]   get us the same benefit
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.520]   as getting into very uncomfortably cold water
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.500]   for a very short period of time?
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.140]   - Yeah, it's really good question.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.160]   And I definitely think that this could be future studies
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.980]   on this as well to really unravel
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.460]   what kind of protocols are the best way
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.200]   or also for which outcomes, of course.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.160]   So if the temperature is very cold
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.880]   and you also feel very cold,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.140]   then you should stay in the water a little bit longer.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.020]   So I think it's just, you should get uncomfortable cold.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.780]   So as long as you get uncomfortable cold,
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.500]   it's cold enough and you get this,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.900]   what we call the cold shock.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.700]   So the cold shock is activation
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.720]   of your sympathetic nervous system
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.520]   and these activation of the catechola mines,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.400]   which you just mentioned before.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.240]   - Does the shock mean
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.500]   that I'm having trouble controlling my breathing?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.800]   Is that a good gauge?
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.620]   - Yeah, you can say so
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.660]   because that's kind of like how we define it.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   So you hyperventilate, so you have a faster breathing rate.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.060]   So that increases also
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.500]   because you activate your gasping reflex
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.900]   if you are new to this, but if you are adapted,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.460]   it kind of subsides with time with adaptation.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.140]   So what you can do is that you can train this cold exposure
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.240]   and you can kind of like get adapted to it.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.540]   So you don't have this hyperventilating response
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.280]   every time you go out in the cold water.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.060]   So this is like building up your resilience,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.120]   building up your adaptation.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.100]   It's gonna make the shock like subside a bit.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.300]   So it's always harder in the beginning,
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.100]   but you should do hard things, right?
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.580]   It's not something that we,
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.020]   you shouldn't think about cold water
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.220]   and cold water immersion as something that is comfortable.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.720]   It should be hard because that's the point of it, right?
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.500]   If you enjoy it, then yeah,
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.260]   then I'm thinking something is wrong.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.220]   It's not right.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.280]   You should not enjoy it.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.860]   - Well, this is an important point that you're making
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.720]   because I think that many people shy away
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.900]   from deliberate cold exposure because it's uncomfortable
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.780]   in a way that at least from my experience
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.380]   is very different than the discomfort of exercise.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.720]   Because with exercise, for instance,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.860]   if running fast and breathing hard is uncomfortable,
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.700]   you can slow down or walk.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.120]   If lifting weights is uncomfortable,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.920]   you can remove some weight
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.740]   or reduce the number of repetitions or stop.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.660]   With deliberate cold exposure,
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.060]   I suppose you can be sort of halfway in,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.660]   halfway out of the water
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.620]   or partially underneath the cold shower,
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.060]   but it's very hard to titrate and adjust the level.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.820]   It's kind of all or none.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.060]   And I've seen, I should just, I can tell this by anecdote.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.220]   I've done some work with military special operations.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.180]   I won't say which country.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.380]   This was outside the US.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.860]   And these are very tough individuals.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.360]   They're used to going without sleep and doing hard,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.080]   high consequence, high risk kind of work.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.180]   And they were asked to do some cold water exposure training.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.080]   And I was there that day and it was remarkable.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.880]   About a third of them just went straight in
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.320]   and just kind of grinded through it.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.600]   They looked stoic anyway, to me.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.480]   There were a few whimpers, no cries.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.760]   About a third talked a lot and got really,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.600]   you could tell that they were agitated and anxious,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.440]   but they made it through.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.600]   And then about a third of them just simply would not get in
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.220]   past their knees or thighs.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.680]   Were just, it seemed like they were just dreading
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.520]   the whole experience.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.640]   Some actually didn't actually go in completely,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.880]   which was really surprising to me.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.840]   And you couldn't tell based on their physical appearance
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.160]   or anything else about them.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.120]   They're all high performers
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.360]   as to who would have this response.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.280]   So it seems like people vary tremendously
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.600]   in terms of their ability to embrace
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.940]   the discomfort of the cold.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.520]   Is that, from your studies,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.040]   is that your experience as well?
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.840]   Or are there these weird mutants
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.680]   who seem to just love going into the cold
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.240]   for the first time?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.160]   - So some people just feel better in the cold
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.640]   and some people dread the cold even more.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.420]   And you can say the more people are pushing the cold away,
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.780]   they might feel the cold pain even more.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.360]   So they would definitely,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.400]   people who are maybe the soldiers you just talked about,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.800]   some of them might be already adapted to the cold.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.040]   So if they are not scared of the cold,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.600]   they go out and they embrace the cold in a better way.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.080]   It could also be that some people
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.800]   have a more sensitive nervous system.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.560]   And when you are a bit sensitive to the cold,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.640]   you will, of course, try to get away from it, right?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.720]   And you will also have the cold pain more,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.920]   feel the cold pain more if you avoid it.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.960]   So the more you avoid the cold,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.960]   the more painful it will feel when you go into it, so yeah.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.560]   - You mentioned being outside in a t-shirt
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.740]   versus cold immersion up to the neck versus shower.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.500]   I think this is something a lot of people wonder about.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.600]   What are the differences in terms of impact,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.440]   short-term and perhaps even long-term,
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.180]   between cold showers, cold plunge to the neck,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.880]   so that could be an ice water or just very cold water,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.560]   immersion with dunking one's head and then coming up,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.360]   because obviously people have to come up for air
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.100]   at some point, and then simply being outside on a cold day
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.540]   in shorts and a t-shirt or something of that sort.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.340]   - So there are different outcomes
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.680]   because they are very different exposures of the cold
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.700]   to your cold receptors in your skin.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.840]   So the more you can say you cover your body in the cold,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.640]   which you would do in cold water,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.440]   because they're, of course, covered totally
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.760]   and the molecules are closer to your skin,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.600]   you will have a more potent activation
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   of all your cold receptors in the skin.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.400]   So that one will definitely activate
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.780]   your autonomous nervous system more and rapid
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.340]   compared to going out in a t-shirt in the cold wind,
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.740]   just go for a walk, but that is also something
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.460]   that's gonna activate your sympathetic nervous system,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.340]   meaning that you will have an increase in norepinephrine
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.320]   and you will activate something called the brown fat.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.940]   So this is a healthy kind of fat tissue
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.980]   that we have in our body, and when you activate that,
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.600]   that's gonna increase your metabolism.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.820]   - Before we talk about brown fat,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.960]   and I'm so glad you brought it up
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.940]   because there's so much to talk about there,
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.340]   what about cold shower?
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.600]   I mean, obviously cold shower is somewhere in between
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.940]   being outside in the air, cold air,
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.800]   versus being immersed up to the neck.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.220]   - If we had more studies on cold showers,
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.820]   we would learn more about how does that activate
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.420]   our metabolism, how does that increase our neurotransmitters
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.180]   in the brain, which could also have an impact
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.660]   on our mental balance.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.260]   So I think that would be interesting for the future.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:49.080]   But what we do know is from activating brown fat
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.380]   and both from rodent studies, but also in humans,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.100]   is that as soon as we get cold on our skin,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.280]   we will activate our brown fat.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.540]   So it is kind of like our first responder in the body
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.740]   to keep our temperature up.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.100]   So our muscles is like the second tissue in our body.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.380]   We have two tissues which can increase our thermogenesis.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.820]   So the brown fat, which is like always like temperature
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.660]   regulating our body, and then we have the muscles,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.560]   which will secondarily start to shiver,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.240]   and that's gonna increase our temperature in the body.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.460]   But as soon as you go into a cold shower,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.760]   you will activate your brown fat also immediately.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.860]   So it could be good also for increasing metabolism,
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.620]   in theory, because we haven't really any studies
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.200]   showing how much does it actually activate the brown fat.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.040]   So if someone out there wants to do a study on that,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.880]   that would be great.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.620]   - I've thought about why there are fewer studies
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.360]   of cold showers than cold immersion.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.460]   And I think the answer to my mind
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.640]   is that from a methodological standpoint,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.740]   it's just harder to do because if people are getting
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.340]   into cold water up to the neck,
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.960]   they're getting into cold water up to the neck.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.140]   Whereas if people are getting into a cold shower,
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.820]   some people are larger or smaller.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.160]   Some people are gonna stand under the shower
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.040]   with it hitting their head.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.980]   Some people, the back of the neck.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.860]   You could direct people to do it,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.780]   but it's a little bit more difficult.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.720]   Also, I think for, you and I are both research scientists,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.980]   there's a little bit of a methodological challenge
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.900]   that might seem silly to people, but it's a real one,
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.500]   which is if people are in a cold shower,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.340]   also the water is going to be,
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.180]   I'm kind of pushing their clothing against their skin.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.700]   There's a certain vulnerability for most people
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.580]   coming to a laboratory in the first place,
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.860]   let alone being absorbed while they shower.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.240]   Whereas when you get into cold immersion,
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.860]   you're getting under the water.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.740]   And some people might roll their eyes and say,
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.040]   "Okay, really, is that the barrier?"
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.200]   But science exists in these real world contexts.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.540]   And this will vary by culture and things of that sort,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.500]   but we run human subjects in my lab.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.660]   And I'll tell you just the process of getting people
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.980]   to the laboratory and having them park and find the lab.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.800]   And it's a whole new environment with people in lab coats
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.820]   and people moving around and where's the restroom?
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.620]   I mean, there's a certain amount of stress
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.640]   just associated with taking part in a study
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.740]   for most human subjects.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.660]   So I totally agree, however,
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.880]   we need more studies of cold showers.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.540]   It's just a harder environment to control in my mind.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   So it sounds like any form of cold to the skin
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.820]   that people register as what you call the cold shock
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.440]   or uncomfortable, like, oh, like this is kind of jarring,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.060]   activates the brown fat.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.740]   Do we know what the pathway is from cold receptors
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.940]   on the skin to the brown fat?
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.700]   I mean, how does the brown fat know that we're cold?
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.020]   - Yeah, really good question.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.660]   And it seems that I think that, of course,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.260]   in the future, we will know much more about these pathways.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.980]   But what we do know is that the co-receptors
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.620]   will send a signal to our temperature regulating center
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.420]   in the brain, so hypothalamus,
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.580]   and that's going to be taking in this message.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.560]   And we have so many co-receptors in the skin.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.240]   So it's going to be very fast, as you can say,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.600]   if you immerse the body into cold water,
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.820]   this is going to be so rapid.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.280]   So it will have a rapid increase in neurotransmitters
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.760]   in the brain to no adrenaline, adrenaline and cortisol,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.200]   which is not that much, but it's still there.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.000]   So you have this increase in no adrenaline,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   which will then immediately activate the brown fat
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.420]   because you can say the activator is the most potent one,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.040]   cold and no adrenaline,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.220]   that's going to activate the brown fat.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.620]   But there's also a direct pathway from the co-receptors
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.660]   in the skin to the brown fat,
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.680]   which really shows that if,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.280]   because of these different pathways,
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   it shows that it could be that this tissue to keep us warm
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.740]   was developed in our evolvement as humans to keep us warm
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:50.500]   and to save us whenever the temperature on our skin varies
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.040]   just a little bit to keep us in that right
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.640]   homeostatic balance so we don't get hypothermic,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   but also so we don't get hyperthermic,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   but because it seems that the brown fat is also activated
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.180]   when we get warmer in our skin.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.560]   So it's also maybe a temperature regulator in our body,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.520]   but the pathways is different.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.800]   I think it's also a third pathway
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.280]   from directly from the muscles.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.760]   So the brown fat is also activated
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.160]   even though the muscles are starting to shiver.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920]   So there's an extra pathway that way
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.680]   to keep our temperature up.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.940]   So muscles and brown fat are working together
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.080]   to keep us warm so we don't suffer too much
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.920]   in the cold water.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.800]   - That's super interesting.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.600]   And what I hear you pointing to is the existence
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.320]   of three parallel pathways.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.240]   And this notion of parallel pathways comes up
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.720]   over and over again in biology, as you and I know.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.360]   And I think it's important for people to know about
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.960]   because as you said so eloquently,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.160]   when something is very important to our survival
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.080]   and/or evolution, the brain and body
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.960]   install multiple mechanisms for it, not just one.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.840]   And so it sounds like it's cold skin,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.260]   cold on the skin triggers a response in the hypothalamus,
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.080]   which then activates brown fat,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.040]   cold receptors in the skin directly to the brown fat,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.640]   and then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.400]   I want to talk about brown fat in depth
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.800]   and learn from you more about brown fat.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.080]   Before that, however, I want to ask about shiver.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:32.040]   I've heard that shiver causes the release of succinate,
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.260]   which then activates the brown fat.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.440]   Is it known whether or not inducing shiver is important?
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.000]   And when should people shiver?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.560]   I mean, I've gotten into cold plunges
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.960]   and shivered while I was in there.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.520]   And then I've also had the experience
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.880]   of getting into a cold plunge or a cold shower,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.340]   then getting out, or even standing outside on a warm day
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.640]   after swimming in a pool and then starting to shiver.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.060]   So the shiver comes later.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.460]   So how important is shiver
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.840]   and does it matter when shiver happens?
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.760]   - Yeah, well, shivering is good
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.640]   because that increases your metabolism
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.240]   and that's going to burn some calories in your body.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.560]   You shouldn't be so afraid of shivering, I think,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.880]   because the shivering, as long as you don't get
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.960]   too hypothermic, so if you don't sit in the cold water
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.080]   for too long, and what you just said by shivering
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.440]   after you get up, that is because of the after drop.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   Something called the after drop is when your core temperature
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.520]   decreases even after you get out of the cold water.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.980]   And it always does that, your body,
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.320]   because as soon as you get into the cold water,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.360]   all your blood vessels is going to constrict
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.720]   because you need to keep your blood in your core
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.700]   and keep your vital organs warm.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.160]   So as soon as you get up,
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.900]   those blood vessels will open again
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.200]   and the warm blood will flow out and get colder
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.640]   and then flow back again into the core.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.280]   And that's going to decrease the temperature
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.480]   in your core, of course.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.680]   - So that's the drop.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.520]   - So that's the drop, yeah, after drop.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.600]   - Got it, oh, I'm so glad you explained that.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.000]   I've heard, years ago, Wim Hof,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.220]   I heard him talk about the drop
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.240]   and I've heard colleagues of mine talk about the drop,
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.880]   but that's the first time I've ever heard it
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.000]   explained clearly.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.180]   Let me make sure I understand this.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.580]   So I get into cold water, obviously, I'm cold.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.600]   Vessels constrict to keep blood near the center of my body,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.080]   keep me alive.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   I get out, the warming up of my body
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.520]   allows those vessels and capillaries to dilate again.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.900]   The blood goes out to the surface,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.840]   but the surface is still cold.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.580]   And so that blood is cooled
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.760]   and then my core body temperature drops.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.600]   And that's what you're referring to as the drop.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.960]   And that's what induces shiver.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.800]   - Exactly.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.440]   - Great, and then, am I right in thinking
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.720]   that then the shiver activates brown fat,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.280]   which then warms me up again?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.120]   - Yes.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.940]   - Got it.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.380]   - That's why you should end on the cold.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.220]   We can get back to that.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.060]   - Yeah, let's talk about, yes.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.520]   Ending on cold is, you know, it's what I refer to as,
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.560]   and what has now become known as the Soberg principle,
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.600]   which is a really important principle
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.520]   about the importance of ending on cold
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   and not doing what I do,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.000]   which is to get into a hot shower or back in the sauna.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.380]   But we'll get back to that in a few minutes.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.380]   So that's wonderful that you can explain that so clearly,
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.480]   because I think that shiver is something
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.160]   that a lot of people do avoid.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.200]   People think, oh, I don't want the chattering of the teeth.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.440]   And it feels like a loss of bodily control,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.340]   which really it is.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.460]   It's an autonomic response.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.640]   - Yeah, but I don't think that people
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.320]   should avoid it that much.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.960]   It's just like seeing shivering as a way of your body in,
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.020]   like it's training.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.840]   It's training for all your cells.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.280]   It's training for your muscles.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.060]   It's training of your metabolism.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.600]   And that's gonna increase your,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.580]   what's called the insulin sensitivity.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.160]   So if you can like, in your mind,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.660]   get used to the thought of shivering
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.160]   is just like when you go exercising in the training center
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.420]   and get that feeling of like, oh, this is tough.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.700]   Now it hurts a little bit.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.620]   Yeah, it's gonna hurt
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.880]   because that's what shivering also does,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.300]   but it's just a different way
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.160]   of training your cells and your body.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.860]   It's gonna create what is healthy stress.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.780]   It's called homeosis in the cells.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.700]   And the more you expose your muscle cells
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.040]   or your brown fat cells
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   to these kind of like healthy stresses,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.760]   exercise, cold, and heat exposure,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.140]   it's gonna make them better at like activating
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.760]   and also at keeping you healthy.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.580]   So as long as the cells get exposed to this,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.900]   it's gonna keep them on its toes, you can say,
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.300]   because it becomes more robust,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.860]   increasing these heat shock proteins
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.040]   and cold shock proteins in the cells
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.240]   to make you more robust for the next time.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.420]   And that is also what happens
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.360]   when you go to the training center.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.620]   And I keep like drawing that parallel
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.020]   because people today know more about,
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.660]   we know more about exercise
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.060]   and what that is gonna do to your muscle cells.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.920]   But the same kind of like training
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.380]   is also what you do when you go out into the cold water
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.040]   and submerge into cold water,
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.820]   because that is just your cold training center,
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.660]   you can say that.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.440]   And also your heat training center going into the sauna
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.600]   because the cells are getting stronger with hermetic stress.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.220]   So it's the same process, just different practices.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.160]   - I'm so glad that you brought up the fact
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.180]   that the discomfort or the embarrassment or both of shiver
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.940]   is still crucial to actually to reach for
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.560]   and try and experience the same way that with exercise,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.860]   I think a lot of people don't realize this,
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.980]   but when we did our series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.080]   it became clear to me
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.500]   what should have already been clear to me.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.100]   And I think that most people don't realize,
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.540]   which is that if we were to measure heart rate,
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.740]   blood pressure, stress hormones, and inflammation
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.740]   in a human being during exercise,
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.700]   it would look as if they were ready to die.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.660]   Blood pressure would be high,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.940]   inflammation is through the roof,
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.120]   but all of that is setting in motion and adaptation
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.500]   or set of adaptations
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.140]   that allow blood pressure to be lower at rest,
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.820]   that allow inflammation markers to be lower at rest,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.040]   all the things that everybody is seeking with exercise.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.900]   In addition to, of course, the aesthetic changes
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.680]   that people are seeking with exercise.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.820]   It sounds like the exact same things
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820]   are happening with the cold.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.620]   So the redundant message here seems to be
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.080]   that the more discomfort, provided it's done safely,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.500]   just like with exercise,
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.740]   the more shivering, the more cold shock,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.620]   provided it's not to the extreme
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.180]   and stop somebody's heart, right?
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.420]   We can talk about thresholds for that a little bit later.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.700]   It sounds like all of that is going to set in motion
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.700]   some long-term changes that will make people feel better
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.360]   and will improve health.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.780]   Could you just touch on a few of the longer-term changes
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.900]   that are known to occur?
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.000]   I mean, I'm well aware of the study showing that,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.180]   I think it was European Journal of Physiology,
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.200]   it was the European Journal of Physiology,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.080]   showing long-lasting increases in catecholamines,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.760]   dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.440]   for many hours after deliberate cold exposure.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.320]   What are some of the other things that happen
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.080]   at the level of metabolism and brown fat
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.400]   in, let's say, the hours and day
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.520]   after a deliberate cold exposure?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.000]   - As soon as you go in, of course, there's an activation,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.280]   but it seems like, no, you're asking for the later outcomes
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.860]   like blood pressure and stuff like that.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.700]   Is that what you mean?
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.040]   - Yeah, blood pressure, but also in terms of metabolism.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.880]   I know that in your study,
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.020]   and we'll talk about brown fat in depth here in a moment,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.680]   but that there were changes to the brown fat
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.720]   that equate to changes in, for instance,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.800]   people's ability to be comfortable in colder environments
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.320]   when they're not doing deliberate cold exposure,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.680]   or in the same way that I can exercise on an exercise bike
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.800]   or go out for a hard run,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.920]   but then if I go hiking with the family on Sunday
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.180]   and it's a steep climb,
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.660]   I could do that steep climb more easily
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.240]   because I'm quote unquote fit
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   as a consequence of the exercise.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.640]   What are some of the fitness adaptations
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.800]   of deliberate cold exposure?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.520]   - Yeah, so what happens is that you get adapted
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.240]   a little bit every time you go.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.960]   So you will, like exercise, get a little bit stronger.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.680]   So every time you go into the cold water for every time,
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.800]   you will be more exposed to it.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.280]   You will feel more comfortable in the cold.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.940]   So you're gonna build your adaptation,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.920]   which happens on a metabolic level,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.560]   which is gonna be the brown fat.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.760]   So we have more activation of your brown fat.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.700]   The mitochondria in the brown fat cells are gonna be,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.920]   you have more of those,
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.260]   and they will be more efficient at heating you up
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.640]   because the body expects you to do this again.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.680]   So you are prepared in a way.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.360]   The capillaries in your skin
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.580]   will also become better at like constricting.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.660]   So you will have a better shield of your body
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.380]   to prepare you for the next time.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.020]   So you will become better at going into the cold water
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.860]   in that way.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.960]   So the body makes these mechanism
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.800]   and changes your body in a way
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.720]   so you can expose yourself to the next time, right?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   And also you will have also your stress response
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   will also be subside a bit.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.260]   So you will have a less increase
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.520]   of your catecholamines with time.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.960]   With time also you have,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.920]   because of this activation of your brown fat or your muscles
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.900]   you will have an increase in your metabolism,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.680]   which will then make your insulin sensitivity better.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.500]   And this is shown in studies, for example,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.460]   there was this interesting study I found
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.640]   just before I started my PhD,
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.560]   which was from Gieber Stomer et al from 2016,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   where they measured metabolism not on brown fat,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.120]   but they measured insulin sensitivity
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.900]   in middle-aged men and women
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.040]   during one winter swimming season.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.520]   So they were not very young like they were in my study,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.640]   but they were middle-aged.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.200]   And I think this is very interesting.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   So during these four or five months,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.660]   they were winter swimming,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.940]   they saw that they had a lower blood pressure
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.380]   after the season and they had a lower heart rate.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.860]   And they also saw that they have
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.440]   better insulin sensitivity.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.460]   And I think that is very interesting
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.880]   because if you can have a better insulin sensitivity,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.440]   you can prevent lifestyle diseases.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.640]   So, and with lower blood pressure,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.040]   which is a very strong outcome also
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.320]   for telling how much inflammation you have in the body.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.600]   And because it didn't measure brown fat,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.920]   I figured that it could be, that was the missing link.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.640]   That was one of the explanations
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.920]   to why we see this less inflammation in the body.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.720]   So the longer outcomes, the long-term outcomes
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.760]   could be that you lower your blood pressure
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.880]   and have a lower heart rate.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.000]   You also have a better insulin sensitivity
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.940]   and a better glucose balance,
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.640]   but that is shown in my study.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.160]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.080]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.520]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.900]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.800]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.480]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.280]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.360]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   once or usually twice a day
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.960]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.040]   Our gut is very important.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.600]   It's populated by gut microbiota.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.360]   That communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.760]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.400]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.100]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.280]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.560]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.180]   that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.920]   are met and it tastes great.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.360]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.760]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.720]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.040]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.620]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.040]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.720]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.080]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.300]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.840]   - And we'll get back to the insulin sensitivity
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.240]   and glucose balance.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.920]   That's an impressive list of benefits.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.820]   Blood pressure, of course,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.420]   most people are aware of blood pressure and what it is.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.500]   It's what they measure when we go to the doctor.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.280]   And it's not very sexy nowadays, you know, blood pressure,
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.640]   people go, oh, you know, blood pressure.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.980]   It's not, you know, people want to hear
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.520]   about the inflammatome and the microbiome
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.000]   and all of that stuff is really interesting.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.880]   But I think that blood pressure
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.480]   doesn't get enough attention.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.500]   And we have spoken to, on this podcast, to Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.480]   who is an expert in longevity and healthspan
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.700]   and things of that sort.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.480]   And I was surprised to learn,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.100]   again, I shouldn't have been surprised,
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.300]   that the number one reason people die,
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.000]   worldwide, is cerebral vascular disease
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.600]   and cardiovascular disease.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.980]   And there are basically three things
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.620]   on the list of things to address.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.960]   One is not smoking, or vaping, by the way, not smoking.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.020]   There are a few other things related to blood markers,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.500]   ApoB and things of that sort.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.020]   But then the big one is blood pressure.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.240]   And so it's interesting because we don't think
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.380]   about blood pressure that much anymore
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.280]   as the kind of people interested
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.120]   in health optimization and health,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   but blood pressure is so vital to control.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.140]   So it's wonderful to hear that deliberate cold exposure
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.620]   is one way to control blood pressure,
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.700]   I'm guessing in concert with other forms of exercise.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.260]   Let's talk about brown fat.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.180]   And if you're willing, I'd love to drill
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.540]   into brown fat at a deep level.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.700]   Again, my understanding of this
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.280]   is far more elementary than yours, obviously.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.380]   You're the expert.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.860]   My understanding about brown fat
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.080]   is that it's located in specific areas of our body,
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.660]   maybe more widespread than when I learned in school.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.040]   I thought it was, I was taught it was just at the clavicles
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.580]   in the back of the neck and upper back, but who knows?
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.160]   I learned that there's more of it when we're children,
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.560]   maybe more distributed throughout our body,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.740]   and that it's rich in mitochondria.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.560]   But what is so special about the brown fat?
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.660]   Like if we could just go into the biology
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.560]   of brown fat a little bit, what does it look like?
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.000]   You've measured it in human subjects.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Where is it distributed really?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.120]   Can it expand its distribution?
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.500]   Can we activate and expand the amount
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.140]   of brown fat as adults?
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.600]   And for those of you that are cringing already
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.340]   thinking we're talking about getting fatter,
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.220]   it's quite the opposite.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.520]   We're talking about not subcutaneous fat,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.580]   but fat located around the organs.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.660]   But please educate me, tell me where I'm wrong,
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.040]   and expand my knowledge on brown fat.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.700]   - Okay, yeah, you are not wrong,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.020]   but it's true that there are more locations
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.920]   of the brown fat than we previously thought.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.840]   There's this very nice study from 2017 by Leitner et al.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.620]   where they had made these pettities overlays
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.420]   of their subjects, where they could see
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.020]   where in the body do we have brown fat,
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.760]   and where can we grow more brown fat, so to say.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.640]   So the brown fat is very plastic,
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.020]   so it means that it can grow and it can decrease.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.140]   And this is proven in studies where we have seen
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.940]   people with a failed cryocytoma,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.100]   it's like a very specific cancer type,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.340]   where from the '70s, where we can see
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.700]   that if they have this specific kind of cancer type,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.460]   they have this tumor on the adrenal gland,
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.820]   so they have like a huge increase in noradrenaline.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.160]   And because of that, they have this continuous activation
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.420]   of the brown fat, and they have grown a lot of brown fat
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.000]   in the whole body, I don't know where it's located
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.740]   in these six different places,
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.340]   but it is like very much compared to like normal people.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.800]   And what they then see, what we learned from this study
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.840]   is that brown fat can apparently grow
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.700]   if you have an increase in noradrenaline in the body.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.020]   It's not like you want that because when that happens,
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.220]   you have a high blood pressure,
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.500]   you don't want it chronically, right?
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.280]   You just want it on like a short amount of time,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.940]   and then it can grow for a bit,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.180]   but you don't want it chronically, of course not,
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.640]   but because it activates also your sympathetic nervous system
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.580]   so they have also showed they have high blood pressure,
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.520]   they had, they lost a lot of weight, of course,
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.060]   because this is activating your metabolism.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.940]   So they found luckily that when they removed
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:36.940]   this benign tumor, that the brown fat
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.780]   decreases again to normal size and they gained weight again,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.820]   and they had normal blood pressure.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.960]   So the story ends well, but it's kind of like proof
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.560]   of concept of the brown fat can actually grow.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.020]   So it's plastic in its way of like it can grow
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.180]   and it could decrease again.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.340]   So that's very good, good studies to see
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.920]   what the body is capable of.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.220]   But we don't, of course, want all that brown fat.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.740]   We just want it to be, we just want to keep it actually
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.660]   and keep it activated because what we see in studies
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.460]   is also that after the age of 40, people,
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.880]   studies have shown that there is an association
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.020]   with having less brown fat, but increased obesity.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.860]   So of course we don't know yet whether brown fat decreases
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.820]   with AIDS and therefore we get obese or we get obese
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.320]   and therefore we have less brown fat,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   but as brown fat is an insulin sensitive organ in our body
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:39.180]   and we get obese, just like the muscles get less sensitive,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.540]   insulin sensitive, the brown fat does as well,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.660]   and therefore it maybe decreases.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.100]   It could be a theory that I think could be one of the reasons
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.320]   why we don't see that much brown fat in elderly people.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.500]   Some have a lot, especially people working outside.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.980]   There are studies showing this.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.900]   - People who- - Who work outside.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.060]   - Do physical work outside, farmers and, interesting.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.980]   - Yeah, they expose themselves to it,
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.440]   so they'll just keep it in that way.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.260]   - And I suppose we should clarify for people
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.540]   in case they don't know that insulin sensitivity
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.300]   is a very good thing, you want that.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.440]   You want your cells to be sensitive to insulin.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.620]   Insulin insensitivity is type two diabetes
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.300]   and is associated with obesity.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   So just a point of clarification there.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.220]   Yeah, it's interesting to me, I usually work out at home,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.740]   but I go to a gym once or twice a week if I can,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.820]   because it's good if I see the outside world.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:44.360]   And there are a few individuals at the gym who,
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.200]   they're not particularly large or muscular,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   but they are incredibly lean and their posture is great,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.580]   presumably from the musculoskeletal work,
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.860]   and they're in their 70s and 80s.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.180]   I mean, it's remarkable, right?
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.540]   And I know all the telltale signs of hormone augmentation.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.380]   I'm very good at spotting that.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.700]   There are a few telltale signs.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.060]   I've talked about this on other podcasts,
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.420]   and that's not why they're fit.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.880]   They're clearly of that look,
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.300]   and you see this outside the gym too, of course,
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.580]   for people that look like they've done
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.540]   a lot of physical labor their whole life.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.980]   They're just moving a lot.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.700]   They have strong hands and features,
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.060]   and they're not necessarily excessively lean,
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.020]   but you can tell that they've been using
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.980]   their musculoskeletal system.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.420]   And I like to talk to these people and ask them like,
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.060]   not what are you doing now for your workout,
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.820]   but what did you grow up doing?
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.140]   And I would say,
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.020]   and obviously I haven't run statistics on this,
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.540]   but more than 75% of them respond
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.900]   that they grew up on a farm
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.520]   or that they did some sort of manual labor
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.340]   or were a postman or a postwoman
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.740]   or doing something where they moved a lot
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.720]   for their early years and throughout middle age.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.260]   And most of them are now in retirement,
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.940]   but some of them are still working
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.540]   and they all still moving a lot.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.280]   So the relationship between shiver and brown fat
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.980]   makes sense to me.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.940]   But is it the case that as we're just moving around,
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.100]   I've heard of NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.420]   So if we're just moving around
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.100]   that we are activating brown fat,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   or does there need to be this stressor?
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.380]   Does there need to be shiver
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.840]   and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.160]   to activate the brown fat?
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.020]   In other words, is just staying active enough
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.680]   or do we need to do some sort of temperature shock
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   type thing like deliberate cold exposure?
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.220]   - Yeah, I think that is really good question
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.940]   because how, also why do we have this tissue?
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.140]   Then if it has to be extreme,
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.200]   then you can question what do we need this tissue for?
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.660]   But it seems that you can activate the brown fat
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.060]   with just a little bit of exposure to cold.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.260]   So cold is the most potent stressor activator
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.700]   of our brown fat
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.140]   because it's our temperature regulating organ in our body.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.500]   So first responder to that.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.100]   So the muscles will be a little bit too late
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.080]   and therefore we have maybe these two kinds of tissues.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.380]   So actually just exposing yourself or hand actually
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.240]   just to cold water.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.860]   So studies have shown
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.100]   that if you just put your hand in cold water,
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.680]   not that you're gonna do that all day
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.300]   or every day or anything,
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.220]   it's not something you have to do,
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.820]   but it just shows that you can activate your brown fat
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.860]   just by getting a temperature change on your skin.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.340]   So you can go outside and t-shirt.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.280]   That's why also we were just talking about,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.140]   well, people who works outside or move a lot
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.180]   or get out in and out of it,
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.240]   like changing the temperature of their body all the time,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.060]   they will have more brown fat
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.260]   and activating that is gonna keep your metabolism higher
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.860]   and your insulin sensitivity.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.300]   The study has also shown this.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.020]   So the brown fat can be activated
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.900]   as soon as you just change your temperature in the skin.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.780]   So going outside in a t-shirt, wearing cooling vests,
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.980]   also studies have shown this for 10 days,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.300]   it's gonna also grow your brown fat.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.500]   So you can get more brown fat
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.580]   if you expose yourself to the cold.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.460]   You don't have to start in a cold shower.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.180]   You don't have to start in a cold plunge
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.140]   if you're not really ready for that yet,
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:21.300]   but just exposing yourself to the cold wind
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.980]   has also shown to activate your brown fat.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.580]   Or if you don't wanna be like in this awake state,
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.260]   then you can also just sleep in the cold
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.060]   and you won't notice it that much maybe,
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.220]   but studies have shown that
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.760]   if you sleep in 19 degrees Celsius,
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.500]   then you will activate your brown fat
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.580]   and you will grow your brown fat.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.820]   So you have more of it.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.820]   So this very nice studies from Hansen et al. from 2017
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.400]   showed that a group of subjects
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.280]   who slept in a room at 24 degrees,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.020]   and then they made this PET/CT scanning
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.040]   to see how much brown fat do they have from the beginning,
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.900]   so what we call baseline.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.580]   Then they measured again
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.460]   after a month of sleeping in 19 degrees,
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.340]   and they saw, I think it's remarkable,
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.780]   just one month at 19 degrees sleeping there.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.560]   They had a duvet on,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.060]   and they were still had clothes on when they were sleeping.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.380]   - So they're under a cover, under a duvet?
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.460]   - Yeah, under a duvet, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.080]   The subjects were sleeping at 19 degrees
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.020]   for one month, had increased insulin sensitivity.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.420]   The next month, they slept at 24 degrees,
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:27.480]   they measured this again,
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.080]   and they had decreased actually a little bit,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.380]   and then they slept at 27 degrees.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.820]   So quite warm room actually for the fourth month,
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.200]   and they saw even less activation of the brown fat
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.900]   and also insulin sensitivity.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.780]   So it seems that you can expose yourself
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.860]   and pretty rapidly the brown fat will respond to this
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.980]   because it's so sensitive to noradrenaline, right?
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.840]   So if you keep exposing yourself to a little bit of cold,
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.720]   you will also get a little bit adapted to it,
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.860]   but that's because the brown fat
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.900]   has grown these more mitochondria in the cells.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.660]   So these small energy fabrics
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.240]   that's gonna activate the cells,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.140]   and that's gonna take up glucose and fat from the,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.260]   fatty acids from the bloodstream
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.540]   to keep the thermogenesis up.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.780]   And that's gonna clear up some sugar,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.500]   and it's gonna clear up so in the bloodstream
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.700]   and some fat as well.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.940]   So the brown fat can in that way,
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.100]   decrease our unhealthy fat, which is the white fat.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.140]   And the white fat is what we don't want too much of,
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.020]   but we still need some, of course.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.620]   And it's our energy storage.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.320]   So it's very important that it's there.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.220]   We just don't need a lot of it.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.460]   So on our thighs and also around our inner organs,
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.380]   that's where it's located.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.300]   So if we can have activation of the brown fat
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.820]   just by going out in the cold
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.700]   and just by sleeping in a cold room,
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.460]   or if you have courage for it,
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.800]   you can go out and expose yourself in a cold plunge.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.220]   Cold showers is also gonna do the trick.
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.300]   So you can do different variations of this.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.820]   Just exposing yourself to various temperatures
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.340]   is gonna activate the brown fat
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.960]   because it was involved to keep us
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.620]   in a perfect homeostatic balance regarding temperature.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.540]   So to keep us alive.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.020]   - Incredible.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.860]   I wanna just get a clarification around this 19 degrees
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.420]   Celsius room that they're sleeping in.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.920]   So they're under a comforter, a duvet,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.780]   and you mentioned they had clothes on.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.980]   The room is 19 degrees Celsius,
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.900]   but the temperature underneath their blanket
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.380]   might not be 19 degrees Celsius.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.620]   So presumably it's the cold on their face
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:37.480]   that's activating the increase in brown fat
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.560]   that was observed.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.780]   Is that a reasonable expectation?
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.980]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.700]   Because you have so many co-receptors in your face.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.540]   So actually it's enough.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.380]   And I think it corresponds very well
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.420]   with the studies showing that you can activate
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.960]   the brown fat just by putting a hand
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.060]   into a bucket of cold water.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:58.340]   And I did this experiment myself in my studies
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   just to see how well did they respond to cold water.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.820]   So it was four degrees Celsius cold water for four minutes.
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.180]   And then I just measured blood pressure and heart rate
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.100]   to see do they have like an activation of this.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.860]   I actually also measured the brown fat
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.100]   during this cold exposure for four minutes
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.380]   with an infrared thermography camera
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.660]   to see can I see that the brown fat is activated.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.860]   And just to go back to the location of the brown fat.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.540]   So usually you cannot really see activation
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.780]   of your brown fat because it's located centrally
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.740]   in your, around your central nervous system.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.780]   And the biggest depot, as you mentioned before,
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.320]   is up here under the clavicular bones.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.260]   So, and very close to the skin surface.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.460]   And because it's so close to the skin surface,
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.020]   I could measure it with this very expensive camera.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.100]   And it's not very feasible for people to go home
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.420]   and do this.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.940]   Don't because it takes a lot of practice, I can tell.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.580]   But we measured the brown fat with this.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.100]   And I could see that after a few minutes
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.460]   that the activation was there an increase in temperature
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.660]   arose from that activation, just four minutes.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.040]   So it's very rapid.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.420]   And I'm also measured in my study,
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.380]   how deep was the brown fat under your skin?
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.300]   So it's very close to the surface,
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   which also shows that it needs to be there
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.780]   to heat you up and heat your inner organs.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.840]   - Well, I'm delighted to hear all of this
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.060]   and I'll tell you why.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.660]   One is by way of anecdote.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.060]   I mentioned a little bit earlier that as an undergraduate
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.160]   I worked in a lab that studied thermogenesis
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.420]   and we were doing that in animals,
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.740]   but we had this room that was very cold.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.220]   The whole room was cold.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.220]   The guy who I worked for at the time,
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.640]   and I'm Harry Carlisle is a very accomplished physiologist.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.080]   He came from this lineage.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.700]   I don't know if this literature is still discussed much,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.380]   but it's a beautiful literature from Rothwell and Stock.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.360]   They were the ones who discovered
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.320]   non-exercise induced thermogenesis.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.500]   The fact that people bounce,
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.540]   who bounce their legs a lot and move around a lot
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.300]   and have a lot of kind of stochastic movement burn
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.700]   up to 1,800 calories more per day
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.500]   than people who sit more still.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.900]   - Fascinating. - Incredible.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.420]   Just incredible.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.040]   I don't think that work gets as much attention
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.880]   as it deserves.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.560]   Published in journals like Nature, so very fine journals.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:24.160]   But in any event, one of the things that I noticed
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.720]   when I started working in that laboratory
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.120]   was that I was cold because the room was cold.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.560]   And Dr. Carlisle, Harry, said,
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.540]   "Well, the key is to wear a t-shirt in here
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.460]   "for about two or three days and then you will cold adapt."
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.580]   I thought, well, wouldn't I want to put on a hoodie
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.180]   and get warm in there so I was comfortable?
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.140]   And he said, "No, actually what you want to do
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.580]   "is get yourself uncomfortably cold,
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.900]   "activate your brown fat."
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.940]   And indeed, when I did that,
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.260]   I think it was just two days
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.520]   of being in that cold environment.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.740]   Then I could come back on the third day
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.280]   and be perfectly comfortable
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.980]   because the brown fat had expanded
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.440]   or added mitochondria or both.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.400]   And I was perfectly comfortable in that environment.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.760]   I also got very, very lean in those days and weeks.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.000]   Now, I've never been somebody who's very lean,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.680]   nor am I somebody who carries a lot of excess adipose tissue.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.980]   I'm kind of somewhere in the middle.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.600]   I'm sure I could adjust that with feeding if I want to.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.360]   But it was striking what a powerful effect it had
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.120]   on my entire system of thermal regulation.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.160]   And one of the things that I also delighted in
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.660]   when Cell Reports Medicine published your study
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.640]   is they had an accompanying press release
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.460]   that went out to those of us that receive press releases.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:37.780]   And it described a saying in Scandinavia,
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.280]   which is essentially,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.940]   I'm not going to attempt to speak Danish,
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.500]   even though I have much of my family is in Denmark,
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.220]   believe it or not, from Denmark.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.400]   We have a lot of Danes in my family.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.260]   I won't embarrass myself by trying to speak Danish
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.300]   as I did before the microphones were rolling.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.300]   But that there's a saying that I think essentially
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:03.380]   translates to in the fall, when you're approaching winter,
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.040]   you want to actually wear fewer layers,
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.700]   not bundle up when you go outside
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.900]   so that you can prepare yourself for the cold of winter
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.000]   and be able to heat yourself up using your brown fat.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.840]   And that in the spring, as the temperatures are warming,
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.100]   rather than removing layers, you want to wear more layers
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.140]   in order to be a little bit uncomfortably warm
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.340]   so that in the heat of the summer,
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.260]   you're better at cooling your body.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.100]   Do I have that right?
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.300]   And maybe, do you know the saying,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.540]   and would you be willing to share it?
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.260]   Only the Swedes and Danes will be able to understand.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.680]   Maybe the Norwegians too.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.560]   If you don't know it, that's okay.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.820]   - Yeah, so I know the concept of it because we say it,
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   you should wear less before winter and more before summer.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.040]   - Oh, well, there it is in English,
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.900]   so it doesn't have to be esoteric, but okay.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.500]   - Yeah, and you're completely right.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.520]   And I think this is just something that we know
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.000]   in the Scandinavian countries.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.080]   I think that we intuitively know this,
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.040]   but if we just go back a little bit in history,
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.780]   I think that around the 1950s,
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:11.280]   the Russian government went out and said,
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.040]   well, we should do something about the tuberculosis
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.140]   and pandemic or epidemic, the worst at this time.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:23.140]   So they wanted to have the people be more resilient
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:27.820]   to the cold and also increase our immune system.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.340]   So in Scandinavia, and actually also in Russia,
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:35.300]   we put our babies outside to sleep in the prom.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:39.860]   And that is like to also to get more resistant to the cold,
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.260]   but also to increase our immune system.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.660]   And we still do that in Denmark.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.080]   So we- - Do you really?
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:45.920]   - Yeah, we do.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.060]   - Babies are taken out in the cold?
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.580]   - In the snow, in frosty rain, everything.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.420]   My two boys have been sleeping out in winter
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:58.400]   of at least their first many three, four, five years,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.380]   because it's like very good for them.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.320]   And they get a better immune system
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.220]   and get resilient to the cold so they will have less colds.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.860]   And also they run around in a t-shirt when it's super cold
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.800]   because they have activated all the brown fat.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.140]   I didn't understand at that time, I must say,
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.500]   but I kind of like intuitively also knew
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.300]   because we have inherited this way of doing things
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.620]   with our culture.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.900]   So, and I have heard people coming from the US saying,
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:26.820]   Danes are crazy.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.280]   They put the babies outside in proms and leave them there.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.980]   And then they go inside and drink coffee on the cafe.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.300]   [both laughing]
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.580]   - Well, I don't think Danes are crazy.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:39.580]   I adore the Danes, they're amazing culture and people.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.500]   I'm so fortunate to have family members from Denmark,
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.380]   but I did notice.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.180]   So when we were in Copenhagen,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:51.180]   and I know we saw you there not long ago, that was June,
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.620]   the water in the harbor was cold,
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.580]   even though the Pacific is close to here,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.460]   which is very cold, it felt pretty cold,
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.600]   but it was summertime-ish.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.620]   So people were in summertime mode, right?
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.900]   T-shirts and shorts and things of that sort.
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:13.720]   But it did strike me that people in Copenhagen
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:18.720]   are dramatically fitter than they are in the United States.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.980]   I mean, first of all, everyone's bicycling everywhere.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.340]   - Yeah.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.420]   - Not many people wearing sunglasses.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.940]   So trying to extract as much photon energy
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.420]   from the sun as possible, which I support.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.380]   As everyone knows, I'm a big fan of getting sun.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.200]   But also when we did see swimmers,
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.260]   they were swimming in this cold water and like it was nothing
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:46.220]   and the range and age of the swimmers was remarkable.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.900]   You saw the kind of fit triathlete looking types,
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.260]   but also young kids, like really young kids.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:52.400]   And then people probably in their,
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.400]   again, their 70s, 80s, maybe even 90s, really remarkable.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.020]   Vastly different than what you see
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:03.120]   if you go to the ocean here in Los Angeles or elsewhere.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.200]   So yeah, you Scandinavians are onto something with this.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.400]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.100]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.360]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.020]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.500]   to help you better understand your body
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.340]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.120]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.280]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.300]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.900]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.860]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.300]   however, is that they'll give you information
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.460]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.540]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.660]   Inside Tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.620]   of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.660]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral, nutritional,
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.580]   supplementation, or perhaps other interventions
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.980]   you might want to use in order to bring those numbers
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.260]   into the ranges that are optimal for your health.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.280]   Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.840]   three new hormone markers that are critical to measure
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.360]   during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.260]   These are estradiol, progesterone,
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.140]   and thyroid stimulating hormone.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.560]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.460]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.120]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.920]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.100]   I'd like to talk about your study.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.020]   If you could give us a little bit of the backdrop
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.060]   about what motivated that study,
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.500]   and then walk us through what you did,
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.940]   who the subjects were, what you had them do,
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.660]   what you measured, in as much detail
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.480]   as you would like to share,
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.940]   because I think it's such an important,
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.900]   even fair to say landmark study,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.100]   because it also explored not just cold, but sauna,
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.700]   and the co-use of cold and sauna
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.740]   as a way to probe metabolism and brown fat
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.380]   and other markers as well.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.940]   And as you do this, I'm hoping at some point
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.220]   that you might tell us some of the observations
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.540]   that you might've made that interested you
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.660]   that perhaps were not in the paper,
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.900]   'cause that's one of the great benefits
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.500]   of sitting across from somebody who did the work in detail.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.980]   So yeah, if you could tell us about your study
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.380]   and what you did and what you discovered.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.860]   - Thank you for that question, Andrew.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.940]   I love to also explain a little bit what did we do,
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.380]   because when people read this kind of paper,
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.620]   they just see the numbers.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.980]   They don't see what happened before that.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.320]   And human studies are very different from my study.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   My study, you can do a knockout of something,
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.660]   and then everything is perfectly matched and controlled.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.840]   Doing human studies is very far different from that,
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.800]   because people are different even in the groups.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   So yeah, but when I started this research in 2016,
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.140]   I did not really know what the brown fat was.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.940]   So I started reading up on all this,
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.600]   and I was very interested in preventive medicine.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.740]   Also the studies that I did before brown fat
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.180]   was also like very much in the preventive side,
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.220]   like how can we, that was about something else,
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.080]   but the sweet tooth and how can we lower our sweet tooth
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.920]   and stuff like that.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.480]   So, but after that, I wanted to do something new.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.360]   So I looked into the brown fat,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.960]   got hired in this fantastic research group
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.840]   where they, it's a cell group.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   So they mostly did cell studies
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.880]   and they didn't have anyone to do a human study yet.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.620]   But they really wanted me to do that.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.340]   So I read upon a lot of research
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.320]   about how does the brown fat get activated,
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.680]   what have been done already.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.640]   And I mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.720]   I found that particular paper very fascinating.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.880]   And that was also where at that time I was like,
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.820]   okay, so cold exposure as an intervention
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.060]   of sleeping in the cold could be a good thing
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.440]   to go out and say, well, people do this.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.200]   But on the other hand is, first of all, it was already done.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.840]   That was one thing.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.000]   But the other thing was like,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.840]   well, I wanted to see if we can do some kind of activity
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.040]   so we can have people move also, go and do something,
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   do something together or whatever.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.240]   And the cold made us think about,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.080]   well, what about winter swimming?
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.280]   And it was kind of like a bit of a joke in the beginning.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.360]   It's like winter swimming,
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.960]   yeah, it's gonna activate the brown fat, right?
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.000]   But when we read the literature,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.160]   we couldn't really find anything about activation
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.280]   of the brown fat with cold water
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.840]   besides hand in a bucket of cold water.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.120]   That really, that was already there.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.400]   So we were just thinking, okay,
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   so it should be very potent activation of the brown fat
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.680]   if it's cold water, but very different from cold air.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.160]   So it was kind of also a new thing we were going into
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.320]   and we knew that we were gonna do
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.200]   like a more of a proof of concept study
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.680]   at the beginning of it because it was like winter swimmers
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.880]   must in theory activate the brown fat, right?
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.760]   But we kind of didn't really know
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.880]   was this kind of stressor too much, too little,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.800]   or what will happen actually.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.160]   But we had this idea about,
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.080]   well, we always say that cold water and winter swimming
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.560]   will activate your metabolism,
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.340]   but do we know if it does that?
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.220]   No, we don't.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:18.000]   And while this idea was a little bit fun at the beginning,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:18.840]   we kind of accepted it.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.040]   It was like, okay, let's just try this out.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.760]   But because we didn't have the funding for it,
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.360]   we was like, okay, let's do a proof of concept study.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.000]   Let's go with a small number,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   but enough to see a difference between the groups.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.320]   So the power calculation of that study is done
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   on what we know from PET CT scannings of the brown fat.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.020]   So that's the main outcome of that, of course.
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.640]   So, and we wanted to go a little bit small
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.520]   on the numbers of participants
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.780]   because we wanted to dig a little bit deeper
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.400]   into the different mechanisms
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.920]   and also redo some of the days.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.320]   So I really wanted to do that
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.040]   to see if I can replicate also the findings.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.860]   And that's gonna take a lot of funding,
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.840]   but it's also gonna take a lot of time to do it.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.420]   So the proof of concept was just going small,
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   but looking at different mechanisms.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.440]   We also took fat biopsies, for example,
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.520]   and looked at the white fat
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.960]   to see if there was any differences between the groups
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.120]   before and after and stuff like that.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.000]   So that's kind of like how it started.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.280]   And the first year was like a field study for me.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.640]   So I was not a winter swimmer when I started this.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.720]   It was just- - Oh, really?
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.940]   - No, I wasn't at all.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.400]   I would say I was a bit afraid of the cold myself,
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.800]   bit of a cold sissy,
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.200]   always cold having big socks on
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.480]   and sweaters and stuff like that.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.720]   So I was like, I am so comfortable.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.920]   I'm just like everybody else, very comfortable.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.180]   I like being completely temperature neutral,
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.800]   but I started like playing with the storage,
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.040]   like, well, if this is so healthy in theory,
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.320]   I should not pack myself up.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.500]   I should start not doing that.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.700]   Yeah, but the first year observation
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.800]   of winter swimmers on the jetty,
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.240]   they kind of joked about it and say,
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.960]   "Come on, Zainu, you need to try this.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.320]   You cannot study this unless you have tried it."
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.020]   And I was like, "Ha ha, very funny.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.280]   Of course I can do that." (laughs)
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.600]   But I couldn't.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.840]   I read the literature.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.280]   I understood in theory what happens
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.640]   when you go into cold water,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.700]   but I completely understood it when I first tried it.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.340]   The first few times, not so funny, it felt painful.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.980]   It was just like running too long after a long break
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.160]   and your muscles hurt the day after, right?
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.400]   You completely regret that you took that extra mile.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.880]   - What about, when you say uncomfortable,
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.000]   you mean uncomfortable when you got in
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.400]   and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards?
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.240]   Because I find that on rare occasions,
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.920]   well, I should just, full disclosure,
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.240]   I do deliberate cold exposure every morning
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.900]   for about a minute to two minutes in a cold plunge.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.900]   There are days that I miss,
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.460]   but when I'm at home, I do that.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.580]   And when I travel, I do a cold shower.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.100]   I do finish with a warm shower. (laughs)
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.540]   So, and we'll talk about
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.400]   why that's probably not the best idea.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.400]   But, and I've been doing it for some years now, on and off.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.460]   But, so just full disclosure, I'm a devotee
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:19.260]   and I have family members that hate the cold,
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.060]   but have gotten into it and are starting to like it.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.780]   But they don't, and I don't necessarily like the experience
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.900]   in the cold water, but I love the way I feel when I get out.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.320]   And I'm 100% on that statement
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.940]   about loving it when I get out.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.460]   Occasionally, it feels good to be in there.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.780]   It feels invigorating.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.860]   And I think I've learned to control the gas reflex
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.000]   and the hyperventilation.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.040]   And I just have told myself what we know,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.860]   which is that the forebrain struggles to engage
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.360]   for the first 20 or 30 seconds.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.200]   But if you can get past that wall,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.440]   it's far easier to push through.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.320]   But when you say that it was really uncomfortable,
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.040]   do you mean the experience of getting in
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.240]   or you also felt lousy afterward?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.380]   - Yeah, and very important to clear that out.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.680]   I only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.880]   But afterwards, the first time I went with a group
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.160]   and actually my husband was there as well,
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.200]   because I really wanted someone I knew coming along
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.080]   because it's very normal if you haven't done this
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.680]   before you feel a little bit anxious about it.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.000]   This is shown in studies as well,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.840]   because blood pressure and heart rate goes up
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.120]   in those who are new to this kind of activity.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.500]   So I was a little bit anxious about it.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.960]   So it was really uncomfortable just doing it.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.080]   But afterwards, as soon as I got up, I felt fantastic.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.160]   And we went into the sauna and I did three rounds
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.040]   because I just loved it.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.680]   I loved the feeling afterwards,
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.640]   because you have all these neurotransmitters
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.840]   going in your brain and you feel more positive.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.160]   You feel, I feel invigorated, I had so much energy.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:55.360]   And I could totally see why people would do this
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.040]   to get energy throughout the day,
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.580]   because I definitely had that.
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:02.040]   I didn't have to do three dips to get that.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.440]   I think one would be enough.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.780]   And I often do that also now today.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:10.780]   I do one dip, sometimes I do two or three dips in one round,
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:12.080]   you can say in one day.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.260]   But often it's like just one or two times a week.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.620]   For me, that is enough to get that energy
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.860]   and to get that positive feeling.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.740]   And I think that that is also why
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.460]   I put up my study in that way.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.540]   I wanted to study the lowest dose, you can say,
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.820]   the lowest amount that we can get away with,
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:36.280]   but still see health benefits.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.700]   So what I observed there on the jetty
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.460]   was that some did it a long time.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.260]   They were in the water for a very long time.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.660]   And to me, it seemed maybe a little bit extreme.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.380]   - Could you give me an example of a long time?
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.780]   - Well, so maybe they were like really swimming
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.020]   and they could be 20 minutes or half an hour.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.860]   - That's a long time.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.680]   - That's a long time.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.460]   And there was like ice and people who came up.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.820]   I mean, I just didn't really feel that this is something
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.420]   that I wanted to go out and recommend to people
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.260]   after my PhD. - You don't want
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.340]   any research subject dying either,
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.900]   because if you're not adapted, I mean,
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.540]   people can do that.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.100]   Also a 20 minute cold shower or 20 minute cold plunge.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.900]   I know people do it, but it's probably not a good idea.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.820]   - No, probably not.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.780]   It's gonna exhaust your cells and make them age too fast.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.780]   So exactly, that's when you pass that hermetic stress,
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.420]   the healthy stress level, that's what is happening.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.580]   The quite opposite is almost chronic stress
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.640]   actually in the cells.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.280]   Well, what happened then was that I found out
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.420]   if I want to have this protocol get through ethical comity,
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.740]   I really needed to go like very like sleek
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.460]   with the not too long and make sure
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.060]   that they were also very healthy
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:49.860]   and to get approval, of course, of this study.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:53.900]   But what I did was to recruit winter swimmers
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.580]   who already have been swimming for two or three seasons.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.100]   And I just observed them.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.160]   I said, I'm not gonna do an intervention study yet.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.140]   I did that after, but I wanted to do like a proof of concept
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.740]   where they were already adapted to the cold
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.460]   and then compare them to a match control group
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.260]   who were matched on, you can say diet.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.620]   So were they vegetarian or not?
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.420]   And one of them was in each group.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.260]   Also- - They weren't
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.660]   all vegetarians. - No, no, no.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.900]   Just one in each group, yeah.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.820]   - I was gonna say with all the amazing fish and meat
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.380]   in Denmark, I'd have a hard time being a vegetarian.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.220]   The breads are amazing, the fruits and vegetables too.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.900]   But okay, so there were a couple of vegetarians
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.460]   in each group. - Yeah, one in each, yeah.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.620]   And they were matched- - token vegetarian.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.120]   I have family members who are vegetarian,
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.440]   so I'm just poking fun. - Yeah, but they were matched
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.380]   on different things.
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.740]   So what we usually match them on is also BMI.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.980]   We chose one gender in this study
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:55.620]   and we would always choose both men and women normally,
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.440]   but we do see that there are different brown fat levels
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.460]   depending on gender.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.500]   So women have more brown fat than men.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.180]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.420]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.220]   I think it's interesting.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.800]   - That deserves study.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.700]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.760]   - Why actually?
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.060]   I think it's interesting because women are also smaller.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.140]   So in size, mass, right?
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.040]   But they also have a lower peripheral temperature,
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.860]   especially on hands and ears and-
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.700]   - Is that right?
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.780]   That's documented? - Yeah.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.680]   - Women do run colder than men?
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.640]   - Yeah, and there's also- - Physiologically,
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.180]   I didn't say psychologically.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.120]   - No, no, no.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.600]   - We won't go to the psychological cold heat.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.960]   - Yeah, that's different, something else.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.360]   That's a different podcast. - Yeah, another time.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.100]   So women are just colder physically.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.840]   So on hands and ears, it's measured on that
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.840]   and feet as well, so compared to men.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.660]   And men have bigger hearts than women
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.320]   and they can pump out more blood,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.200]   peripheral than in a woman's body.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.160]   So that could be an explanation
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.280]   for the colder hands, for example.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.080]   Thermocompatible state is also different between genders.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.760]   So men are more comfortable at 22 degrees Celsius
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.080]   and women are thermo-comfortable at 24 degrees Celsius.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.300]   And this is- - Okay, so the thermostat
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.000]   wars of home have been now validated.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.280]   - Yes, yes, there's a study- - Two degrees Celsius.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.240]   By the way, prior to starting recording,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.720]   I made the executive decision
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.360]   that we were going to go with Celsius
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.200]   throughout the podcast,
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.640]   because the majority of the world uses Celsius.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.440]   So for those of you that think in Fahrenheit,
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.640]   the internet is your friend in making those conversions.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.940]   So we're sticking with Celsius.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.620]   So men tend to be thermo-comfortable at 22 degrees Celsius,
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.260]   women at 24.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.640]   Okay, interesting.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.360]   - It explains a lot about also some arguments in the homes
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.020]   where men are turning down the heater
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.080]   and women are turning up the heater and they cannot really.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.720]   So it's really, I'm on both sides here.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.680]   I understand the men, we understand the women,
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.760]   but there is a difference there.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.760]   Which was also one of the reasons
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.420]   why we in this proof of concept study chose one gender.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.320]   So it is not like only because we wanted to study men.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.440]   It was just to see,
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.080]   to eliminate all the confounding factors
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.680]   which could have an impact on our results.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.460]   So that was one of the reasons.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.940]   But also because we, yeah,
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.720]   so women have more brown fat than men,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.040]   and otherwise we would have to do four groups
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]   or something like that.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.360]   And not having funding yet,
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.760]   we were like, okay, we need to do just one group,
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.100]   just a control group,
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:42.200]   and then a group who were already winter swimmers.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.740]   So I recruited winter swimmers
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.040]   who have been swimming for two to three seasons
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.320]   because I wanted them to be already adapted,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.260]   but not going too long in the water.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:56.280]   So they told me, I did a lot of screening here, of course,
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.080]   beforehand and interviews to see, to ask them,
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.460]   how much do you do and how long do you stay in the water?
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.760]   And I monitored how long did they stay in the water
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.440]   and recruited based on that they only did
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.960]   like two to three times per week.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   It seems reasonable for Denmark, at least, to do that.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.880]   And they stayed only in the water for one to two minutes.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.260]   So the coast subsides very quickly
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.820]   and you will get this activation of your rest and digest
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:29.420]   system, which is your parasympathetic nervous system.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.040]   So the other branch of your autonomous nervous system.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.720]   And you get that activation
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.860]   because you submerge into cold water.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.020]   And when you do that,
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.140]   you have an activation of your diving response,
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.620]   and that's gonna slow down the, you can say,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.900]   the consumption of oxygen also in your body,
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.960]   and that's gonna slow down your heart rate.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.900]   - Could I pause you on this?
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.180]   'Cause I've heard this before,
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.800]   that when we get into cold water, shower or immersion,
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.040]   we get this sympathetic autonomic response.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.980]   So increased blood pressure, increased heart rate,
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.640]   release of norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.540]   in the brain, release of adrenaline, dopamine,
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.280]   adrenaline from the adrenals,
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.120]   dopamine presumably within the brain,
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.380]   but that the parasympathetic response is activated
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.260]   when we put our face into cold water or go underwater.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.960]   And that's a calming relaxation response.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.060]   So this brings us back to,
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.160]   I don't want to take us off track
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.220]   from you describing the study,
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.340]   but this brings us back to the first question,
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:34.260]   which is if I go completely underwater for a moment
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:36.060]   when I start my cold plunge,
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.580]   does that change the physiological outcome
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.540]   as compared to if I just submerge myself up to the neck?
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.340]   And actually nowadays there seems to be
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.420]   a little bit of a movement online
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:48.640]   of people putting a bowl of ice water on their countertop
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.320]   and submerging their face into it.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.160]   Did you see this?
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.360]   I've seen more and more posts about this.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.320]   So can you just touch on what the dive reflex is
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.780]   and why it perhaps activates the parasympathetic response,
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.840]   this calming response?
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.320]   - Well, so the diving reflex is activated
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.620]   when you submerge into cold water.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.020]   - Even just to the neck?
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:09.860]   - Yeah.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:11.620]   - Or I thought you had to get your face under.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.940]   I'm not arguing different.
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.780]   You're the expert.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.700]   I just want to, yeah.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.200]   - I haven't really, I haven't read that.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.980]   I've just seen that you can activate your diving response
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.800]   as soon as you go underwater with your body.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.180]   So you don't have to do it with your face
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.540]   as far as I understand.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.120]   I could be wrong though.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.500]   So when you activate your diving response,
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:40.020]   you will slow down your oxygen consumption in your body.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.500]   And that is because the body tries to preserve oxygen.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.640]   So you will not get hypothermic too fast.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.840]   So it's kind of like a survival system in your body.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.480]   So this survival system is very important for us, of course.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.960]   So that will be activated.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:01.400]   And because of that, you will after maybe one minute or so,
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.900]   I can't be precise on that
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.080]   because maybe it also varies a bit in humans.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.580]   So one to two minutes,
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.340]   you will have full activation
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.700]   of the sympathetic nervous system,
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.600]   but also the parasympathetic nervous system.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.640]   And that's gonna activate, for example,
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.620]   something like serotonin in your brain,
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:20.120]   which is also good for mental balance
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.140]   and people feeling in mental balance afterwards
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.360]   after they go up.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.840]   So that is measured on questionnaires
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.680]   and also measured on anecdotes.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.260]   Of course, people tell all the time
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.880]   that they feel good afterwards.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.960]   We need studies on this.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.620]   So if anyone's sitting out there thinking
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.020]   that's interesting, then please do some studies on that
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.120]   to get more out on that.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.320]   - Yeah.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.000]   - So you observed these winter swimmers
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.540]   who have done this for a few seasons.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.380]   They're coming around for a new season of winter swimming
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:55.560]   and you've decided to recruit them as subjects.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.240]   They are getting into cold water,
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.520]   climbing down a ladder or jumping into the water
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.360]   up to their neck.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.200]   - Yeah, climbing, yeah.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.400]   - Okay, climbing down a ladder
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.440]   'cause this is done outdoors.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.560]   What a fun study to do.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.760]   My graduate thesis was done under fluorescent lights
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.480]   with no windows in a building that,
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.360]   I mean, I had a ton of fun as a PhD student.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.560]   I actually lived in the laboratory as a PhD student.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.780]   I loved it so much,
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:20.700]   but not something required to do a PhD, by the way.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.480]   But they're climbing down the ladder,
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.540]   getting in up to their neck,
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.720]   staying in for one to two minutes and then getting out.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.640]   And how many times a week are they doing this?
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.680]   - So they do this two to three times per week.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.280]   And for each time they go, each day they go,
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.640]   they take three rounds of,
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.280]   so three dips and two sauna sessions.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.040]   So they start in the cold and they end in the cold water.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.380]   - Okay, so it's get in for one to two minutes,
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.160]   then get out and get into the sauna.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.300]   - Yeah.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.220]   - What is the temperature of the sauna?
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.360]   - About 80 degrees Celsius.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.480]   - Okay, then how long are they in the sauna?
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   - So they stayed there for 10 to 15 minutes.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.280]   So depending on if they went two times per week
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.440]   or three times per week.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.260]   - Okay, and then they get back into the cold
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.200]   for a few minutes, two minutes?
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.120]   - Up to two minutes, yeah.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.520]   - Okay, then back into the sauna, 15 minutes or so,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.880]   then back into the cold for a third round,
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.000]   back into the sauna, and then they're-
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.840]   - Ending on the cold.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.120]   - And then back into the cold again,
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.680]   and then ending on cold.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.920]   And we will talk about why it's important to end on cold,
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.640]   the so-called sober principle.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.600]   How cold was the water in this particular,
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.080]   given average, 'cause I realized
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.320]   it's outdoor winter swimming.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.140]   So it's gonna vary depending on windchill and things as well.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:42.280]   - Of course, so it's a very uncontrolled environment
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.720]   to do this kind of study in,
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.100]   but I wanted to do something that was also very close
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.960]   to something people could do for free,
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.620]   going out in nature and use that,
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.200]   and also have the nature-like.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.920]   It's a very healthy impact on us.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.120]   It lowers our stress level as well.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.080]   So by doing so, I also measured the temperature
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.600]   every time they went.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.000]   So I have this graph,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.920]   and it's actually in the "Winter Swimming" book.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.680]   It shows the temperature in Denmark
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.560]   going from October to April.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.040]   And it starts at 12 degrees.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.800]   I think it's around 12 degrees Celsius in the water.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.560]   And then it goes down to two degrees
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.640]   on average in January, and then up again.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.160]   So it's within the spectrum of very cold water,
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.120]   I would say from around 15 degrees Celsius and down.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.440]   But it was actually not colder than two to four degrees
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.720]   on average when it was the coldest.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.240]   So it doesn't have to be that cold to be good enough
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.460]   and enough to activate our metabolism.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.380]   - And what time of day are the participants
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:50.240]   doing this cold sauna alternation?
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.560]   - So I think they did this throughout the day.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.240]   So I didn't control whether they wanted to go
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.320]   in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the evening.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.640]   At the time where I set up the study,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.000]   I was not controlling it in that way.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.280]   I wanted them to go whenever they had time.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.600]   And I also think that is the most important message
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.960]   to give to people is do it when you have time.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.760]   It's not, if doing it when you get home from work
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.720]   and it's six o'clock in the evening,
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.960]   and this is the time where you can do it,
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.720]   then try out if it's gonna impact your sleep or not.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.380]   If it doesn't impact your sleep, then fine.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.680]   But you have to try for yourself and find out
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.520]   what works for you.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.560]   It's the same for coffee, for example, right?
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.280]   Some people can drink coffee in the evening
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280]   and go to bed and they can sleep.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.120]   I can't.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.960]   - Or exercise.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.560]   - Or exercise, exactly.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.020]   So I can't do that.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.040]   And that's because the coffee exercise,
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.960]   cold water immersion, it's gonna activate
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.780]   your sympathetic nervous system.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.960]   You have an increase in stress response in your body
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.640]   and that's gonna make it really hard to fall asleep
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.320]   for some people at least.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.240]   Maybe you are super exhausted anyways,
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.500]   and then you will just crash anyways, but yeah.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.720]   But that's the only thing.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.140]   So I just told them to do this if they can
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:07.540]   during the daytime.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.780]   And that's primarily what they also did.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.040]   - And then all along you're measuring brown fat
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:18.540]   by way of this infrared camera, right?
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.160]   So what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat?
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.000]   How quickly did that occur?
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.700]   And then I'd like to ask also about sauna a bit more
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.740]   because earlier you mentioned
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:31.800]   that you can activate brown fat with sauna as well,
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.860]   with heat on the surface of the skin.
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.620]   How long did it take
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:41.460]   before you observed significant increases in brown fat?
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:45.780]   And was it increased density of brown fat or distribution?
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.580]   Was it showing expansion to different regions
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.920]   throughout the body?
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.280]   And maybe you could also touch on some of the changes
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.820]   in insulin sensitivity and metabolism.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.060]   - Yeah, a very good question.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.420]   And I didn't mention this before,
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.660]   but besides measuring temperature
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.780]   as an outcome for brown fat activity,
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:10.140]   we also did PET-MRR scanning of the brown fat.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.160]   So this is like the golden standard for measuring brown fat.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.920]   And it's not very feasible for normal people
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.920]   to get a PET-CT or PET-MRR scanning of the brown fat.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.180]   It's super expensive.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:28.180]   So we had both to see if we could have like a continuous
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.060]   measure of brown fat in humans
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.060]   because that was already not out there.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:37.460]   So I wanted to see during both the experimental days,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.840]   but also during day and night,
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.860]   what kind of like circadian rhythm do we have
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.180]   in our brown fat activity?
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.820]   So that's why I wanted to have that as well.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.180]   So the PET-CT scanning or the PET-MRR scanning
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:56.180]   was to see upon cold activation stimulation for some hours,
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:58.080]   do we have activation?
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.580]   Can we see the brown fat in this subject?
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.900]   And also during thermal neutrality
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.780]   or thermal comfortable state,
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:08.180]   how is that activated in each of the group, of course?
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.000]   - Ah, so you want to see how comfortable people were
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.900]   away from the cold water and sauna
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.620]   just at different temperature environments.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:17.460]   Is that right?
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.440]   - Yeah, so also measured that.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.980]   How comfortable are you?
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.420]   I made this scale like visual analog scale
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.500]   and asked them how comfortable do you feel
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.900]   with this temperature and throughout the study days
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.780]   during cold exposure and thermal comfortable day.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.980]   I had a whole day where I just kept them
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.860]   thermal comfortable to see, do they activate the brown fat
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.240]   if they're just completely thermal comfortable?
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.100]   As good as we could get with that
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.980]   because you were asking people on a scale from one to 10
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.860]   and five being thermal comfortable,
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.300]   where are you on this scale?
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.220]   So one would be very cold
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.860]   and 10 would be super burning hot.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:59.500]   Yeah, and so that was the way to try to figure out
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.340]   how do they actually feel also during the studies.
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:07.340]   I also measured electromyography of muscles
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:10.440]   to see, do they shiver during the cooling day?
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.420]   Sometimes people shiver
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.500]   before they know they're really shivering.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.160]   So I had this. - Oh, interesting.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.000]   - Yeah.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.880]   - So our conscious perception of shivering
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.560]   might not be the best readout of shiver.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.560]   - Yeah, well, if you also get adapted to the cold water,
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.820]   you will have less shivering.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.440]   They will be less vigorous.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.160]   They will be very small.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.880]   So you wouldn't probably know that you are shivering
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.500]   because the shivering is so small
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:39.020]   and the mitochondria in the muscle cells will be so dense
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.440]   that it doesn't need to shiver maybe that much
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.900]   to get that thermogenesis going
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.440]   compared to when you're completely new
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.540]   to cold water exposure, you're not adapted,
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.140]   then the body needs to create these mitochondria,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.760]   these energy fabrics to keep you warm.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.060]   And that's also what the exercise is in the beginning.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.560]   But when we measured this,
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.340]   we did see that the winter swimmers were shivering less
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:10.960]   or having less vigorous shivering when they said I'm cold.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.180]   So even though their perception of the cold
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.260]   was pretty similar in the groups,
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.940]   we could see that the activation of the muscles
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.780]   that we measured on were different
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:29.120]   and more vigorous in the control group.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.520]   - Were the subjects incentivized to be in the study?
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.060]   Were they paid or anything of that sort?
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:36.100]   Or they just happened to like doing cold and sauna.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.380]   And so that's why they did the study.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.440]   - Well, they got paid a little bit for it, but not much.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.340]   And that's how we do this study.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.940]   - Sure, I was just curious.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.780]   Yeah, I was just curious.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.220]   There might be some folks that wonder.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.960]   So what did you discover in terms of changes
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.460]   in brown fat, insulin resistance,
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:57.340]   or insulin sensitivity rather, and metabolism?
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.260]   - So what we saw was we had this kind of different measures
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.020]   to see what's actually going on
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.460]   when they are already adapted to the cold water
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.020]   compared to a control group
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:14.880]   who was matched on various parameters.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.820]   We did see that the winter swimmers
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.600]   had an increased insulin sensitivity.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.600]   They produced less insulin on all the experimental days.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.620]   So besides from just cooling them
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:31.020]   and measuring the brown fat on each of these cooling days,
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:31.980]   there were two cooling days
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.460]   and one thermo comfortable day, right?
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:39.300]   So I wanted to measure insulin when they were fasting,
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.340]   meaning that they hadn't eaten in eight hours
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:43.560]   before the study day.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.140]   And they were completely laying still,
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.920]   not moving just in a bed.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.100]   And we measured insulin during the experimental day
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.760]   just to see what level are they on.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.420]   And we could see that the winter swim
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.980]   had had lower production of insulin.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:04.380]   And they also, when they had a glucose drink,
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.260]   so we give them that to see if they,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.380]   to test before we enroll them in studies
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.060]   to see if they have diabetes, for example,
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.860]   and not knowing, for example,
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.980]   that that would ruin maybe the study.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.300]   So we test for that and see if they have a normal curve.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.580]   So what we did see in that was that the winter swimmers
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:25.700]   had a faster glucose clearance in the bloodstream.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:29.980]   So after two hours, we could see that they had a lower level
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.240]   and the curve went down faster than in the control group.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.840]   - So despite having lower insulin release,
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.860]   they have better blood glucose clearance,
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.100]   which is really what we all seek, right?
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.700]   Excessive insulin is bad.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:47.420]   Insulin being more or less a chaperone for blood glucose.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.940]   We can do all sorts of other things as well, of course.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.500]   And having high blood glucose, obviously terrible for cells,
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.500]   especially brain cells.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.300]   I don't think people realize how toxic high blood glucose is,
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.140]   having high glucose is sort of great.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:06.740]   If you want to kill neurons, you make their,
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:09.180]   put them in an environment where there's too much sugar.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.380]   Oh yeah, very neurotoxic.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:15.080]   I mean, and there are mechanisms like insulin
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.740]   that buffer that, keeping blood glucose in a reasonable range
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.340]   so that that doesn't happen.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:21.560]   I mean, I think that's why people will go
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.320]   into insulinemic shock.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.800]   Hypoglycemic shock is also possible.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.940]   So that range in which neurons are happy
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.540]   is not a tremendously large range.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:34.140]   Incidentally, the range in which neurons are happy
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:38.640]   in surviving is much greater as one gets colder
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.640]   than when you heat up.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.600]   I mean, you can basically destroy brain cells
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.060]   by getting too hot for too long.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.100]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.620]   - You can definitely destroy brain cells permanently
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.860]   by getting too cold for too long,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.420]   but you have to get really, really cold
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.660]   for a really long time.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.720]   - Yeah, yeah, very interesting.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.940]   - Yeah, we were thinking about doing an episode
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.940]   on sort of survival of the brain after death kind of things,
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.380]   which actually happens.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.220]   We hear about these people who are declared dead
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.380]   and then come back.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:06.540]   And there is actually now a lot
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.240]   of cryopreservation type approaches for that.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.700]   This is, anyway, we risk going into the esoteric now,
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.060]   so I'll steer us back to our discussion about your study.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.220]   But so if I do the math,
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.780]   these subjects are in the cold.
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.380]   Let's say they're doing three rounds of cold
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:29.740]   for one to two minutes, two or three times a week.
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:32.540]   What were the thresholds that you discovered
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.820]   were important for getting these positive changes
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.180]   such as reduced blood sugar
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:42.400]   or clearance of blood sugar being more efficient,
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.400]   reduced insulin, improved brown fat distribution and density?
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.540]   How much cold exposure do people need?
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.240]   How much heat exposure do people need
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.820]   in order to extract these benefits?
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.860]   - Yeah, so when we then calculated the numbers together,
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.980]   we could see that this ended up being 11 minutes
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:03.140]   in total per week.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.740]   So not in one session, of course,
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.440]   but they had two to three visits
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.860]   to the water and the sauna per week.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:12.020]   So when we divide that out,
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:14.120]   it corresponds to being in cold water
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.980]   one to two minutes at a time,
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:18.940]   but also in the sauna 10 to 15 minutes at a time.
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:21.980]   And I think this is very like also similar
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.900]   to what we see in other studies
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.940]   when we look, for example, to the observational studies
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.260]   from the Finnish cohort study from Lauken et al.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:36.180]   For example, they published this very amazing paper in 2015.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.520]   Some results from this long course study
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.520]   where they show that up to 30 minutes in the sauna
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.900]   was healthy and you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.260]   and that's like the threshold.
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.180]   And if you go further than that,
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   then there is not more healthy benefits to gain from that.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:00.980]   So, and before that, it's like 19 minutes,
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.740]   then you will have this dose response relationship
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:04.900]   up to 19 minutes.
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.380]   That's really in decreasing your risk
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.400]   of cardiovascular diseases.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.240]   And I think we really-
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.580]   - That's per week, 90 minutes per week.
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.220]   - 90 minutes per session now.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.940]   - Per session, okay. - Yeah, per session.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.940]   If we then compare that with my study,
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.300]   which was 10 to 15 minutes per session,
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.760]   then I think it fits very well
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.100]   with what we call the hermetic stress or healthy stress
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.060]   that you expose the cells to this kind of like potent,
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.500]   very stressful situation
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.500]   where they increase heat shock proteins in the cells
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.180]   and that will repair the cells.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.180]   But if you then overdo it and you go beyond
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.700]   the maybe 30 minutes in the sauna,
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.540]   this observational study from Finland
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.260]   with more than up to 2,000 sauna bathers
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.340]   where they have followed these for 20 years,
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.100]   they see that 30 minutes per session is like enough.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.580]   And then if you go above that,
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.880]   you don't get more health benefits out of it.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.060]   So I think there's a window where we can say
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:06.540]   the healthy stress corresponds to like 10 minutes
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.060]   and I think it's like- - Per session.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.960]   - Per session and it's not much actually.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.080]   So you don't need to,
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   it shows that you don't have to expose yourself
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.420]   very much to the heat
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.480]   or very much actually to the cold
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.460]   to get this healthy benefits from going into cold,
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.220]   going to heat and have healthy benefits
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.660]   on your cardiovascular system.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.620]   So I think this is very important also message to get out
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.980]   that you don't have to go extreme,
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.880]   you don't have to swim for a half an hour in the cold water.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.480]   You can go in the water for one to two minutes per session,
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.080]   but go up to 11 minutes per week in total.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.500]   And for the sauna, my study showed 57 minutes
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.820]   in total per week.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.840]   And if we also then divide it out
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.020]   on these two to three days and two sessions each day
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:57.180]   correspond to 10 to 15 minutes.
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:59.100]   So it's a low threshold,
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.400]   but I think it's good to have that too.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.400]   Maybe we can aim for that
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.880]   if people need to have something to aim for.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.180]   And I think it's really good to have that
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.000]   because then you don't overdo it.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.980]   And if you overdo it, you exhaust the cells
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.980]   and that will increase your risk
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.860]   of cardiovascular disease also.
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:21.460]   - Well, I get a lot of questions about this
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:23.020]   and I did solicit for questions
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.580]   for this podcast on Twitter.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.360]   And one of the questions that I got was
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.500]   as one becomes more cold adapted,
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.180]   do the benefits start to wear off
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.580]   or can people do too much cold exposure?
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:33.940]   Of course, the answer to that is yes,
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.000]   you can become hypothermic,
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.100]   but I'm sensing a different answer now,
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.660]   which is if I understand correctly,
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.120]   the threshold is 11 minutes total per week
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.480]   of deliberate cold exposure
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.900]   divided into two or three sessions
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.240]   of maybe one to three minutes,
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.360]   depending on how long somebody stays in.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.000]   And then 57 minutes,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.400]   I want to be careful not to round up to an hour,
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.100]   but divided into maybe three 20 minute sessions or so.
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:03.440]   So one doesn't have to be perfect
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.800]   as long as you get beyond that threshold.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.500]   But I wonder something which is,
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.180]   is it the case that if somebody said,
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:14.940]   oh, I'm just going to do one 11 minute session per week,
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:19.640]   that might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.480]   because what you told us earlier is that
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.100]   the hormetic response depends on having that cold shock.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.260]   You actually don't want to become too cold adapted.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.400]   I mean, once the blood pressure response drops down,
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.040]   so in minute four, five, and six,
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.740]   you're getting very cold and you're shivering,
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.380]   but one is not getting the autonomic stimulus
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.220]   that they want.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:43.560]   I guess I could liken this to if exercise worked in a way
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.300]   where it was only the first few minutes of exercise
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.660]   that really triggered the adaptation.
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:49.180]   Of course, this is not how it works,
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:51.500]   but in fact, probably quite the opposite.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.760]   But if that were the case,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.500]   then it's not simply the total amount of exercise,
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.820]   but dividing up the sessions into little bouts
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.960]   where every single time it acts as a stimulus,
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.700]   that seems to be the key here.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.900]   This is very important because having watched
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.800]   the landscape of this on social media,
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.720]   but also in books and generally,
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.280]   I think you're the first person to really touch on this,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.240]   that the goal is not to get so cold adapted
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.240]   that you can sit in for the full 11 minutes in one session,
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.240]   where the goal isn't to be able to do an hour
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.160]   of very hot sauna.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.680]   If you want to, I suppose people could do it
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.980]   for other reasons, but if the goal is to improve
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:33.480]   these health metrics, then the idea is
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.640]   to keep the stimulus a stimulus.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.920]   Short, exactly, yeah.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   - Great, well, this also,
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.200]   I think there's practical feasibility, as you pointed out,
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.920]   'cause getting into a cold shower or cold immersion
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.440]   or natural body water for a couple of minutes
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.820]   is far less challenging to most people
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.840]   than finding a full morning to go spend there.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:59.880]   But I've never really heard it articulated
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.600]   that the longer sessions might not be beneficial
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.720]   and might actually be detrimental.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:09.760]   That's very important.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.740]   Were there any other observations that you made
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.760]   that did not make it into the paper
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:18.480]   or that were kind of in the margin notes,
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.080]   in terms of psychological benefits or anything of that sort?
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.080]   There was this recent study on soldiers
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.600]   that talked about weight loss.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.980]   It's sort of a controversial study for a lot of reasons.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:32.400]   But one of the things they remarked in the paper
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.280]   was that there were a lot of psychological changes,
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.800]   improved buffering against anxiety.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.240]   They even, the men and women in that study reported,
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.480]   one of the significant effects
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.360]   was significantly improved sexual satisfaction.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.780]   Of course, they didn't tell us what that meant
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:48.280]   for these subjects, so we won't go there.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.360]   But a number of subjective improvements.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.320]   Was there anything that you observed or took note of
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.240]   in your study that perhaps didn't make the main abstract
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.520]   but that we should be aware of?
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.120]   - Yeah, there were some.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:06.120]   And today, I regret that I didn't measure on sleep,
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.400]   for example.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   I frankly didn't really think about that
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.880]   when I designed the study.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.880]   So we were very much occupied with the metabolism
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.260]   and kind of had the thought,
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.040]   maybe this could impact sleep quality.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.000]   And I wish I had the thought
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.840]   that why don't you just ask them in a questionnaire?
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.800]   But I asked them every morning,
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.320]   or every morning, it was not many mornings,
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.760]   just two mornings, actually, we measured on.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.760]   But the winter swimmers told us before I wrote them
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.420]   that they had a really good sleep quality.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.400]   The control group also had that.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.740]   But they told me on the day
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:54.120]   where we measured the brown fat on a day and a night,
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.880]   so actually two days and two nights,
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.200]   they told me that they had a good night's sleep,
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.740]   but they also woke up.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:06.300]   So it's just telling me that they also had a quick wake up
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.440]   and then they fell asleep again.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.120]   And the winter swimmers told they have a really good sleep.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.360]   So it's like, in general, they also say we sleep very well,
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.300]   I sleep very well.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:21.000]   So it's anecdotally, in general,
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.200]   it corresponds to what I heard in my study,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.200]   but nothing that I measured on,
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.400]   which could be fun to do in the future,
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.400]   but we didn't measure on sleep quality.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.240]   That would have been a really good idea to do.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.740]   They also told me that they were very comfortable
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.580]   when they were cold.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.840]   They don't mind, winter swimmers,
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.840]   they don't mind going out, for example,
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.760]   in the cold with a T-shirt.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.480]   They were also less scared of showing their skin.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.440]   That was also one observation.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.680]   - So kind of a reduced social anxiety.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.760]   - Yeah, they were just so comfortable in the lab.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.320]   As you just mentioned before,
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.200]   coats on and everybody's joining around.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.840]   It was very busy and all the other scientists
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840]   out in the hallway.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:10.840]   And also my supervisor had her office down the hallway
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.160]   and one of the winter swimmers one day
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.240]   just got out of bed after,
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.120]   had been in the study for eight hours.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.560]   It was a long day, right?
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.280]   He jumped out of the bed and had his clothes in the bathroom
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.440]   and he went out completely naked.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.480]   He didn't care.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.360]   He just went out.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.840]   It was like, oh.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.520]   - So that's a side effect perhaps
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.660]   of getting too comfortable with the cold.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.360]   We're not recommending that.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   Although in your book, you dedicated some,
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.580]   let me start that again.
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.580]   Although in your book, you dedicated some pages
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.780]   to naked winter swimming,
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.640]   or I should say naked cold water exposure
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:56.000]   as opposed to with bathing suit.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.240]   Are there any data on this?
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.080]   I'm sorry, chuckling.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.440]   But I think in most places in the United States,
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.560]   skinny dipping is not legal, most public beaches.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.520]   There are a few.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.320]   In fact, my laboratory before moving to Stanford
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.880]   was in San Diego and I,
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.800]   at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies,
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.580]   beautiful building, incredible science is done there.
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:19.520]   The beach right below that is called Black's Beach.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:24.040]   And it's a no-nude beach.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.040]   And so whenever tourists were heading down the stairway
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.560]   there, I would sort of let them know,
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.800]   especially if they had kids, I'd let them know.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.240]   And it's a nude beach of a particular genre.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.600]   So I'd give them a little warning
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.160]   about what they could expect down below.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.000]   In any event, those beaches are quite rare
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.920]   in the United States, maybe compared to Europe.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.600]   I don't know, but-
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.440]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.040]   - Yeah, so is there anything special
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.400]   about clothesless versus closed exposure?
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.320]   - Yeah, I think in that sense,
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.280]   we are a bit more free with this kind of like,
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.580]   but remember we also had this winter swimming culture
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:02.600]   for hundreds of years in Denmark.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.700]   And the oldest winter swimming clubs that we have,
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.700]   especially the one we have in Copenhagen,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.840]   where I did my next study, which we haven't talked about,
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.520]   and it's also not published yet,
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.240]   but in that winter swimming club,
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.640]   it's the oldest one we have and it's huge.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.040]   And they swim naked at this facility.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:22.880]   - Men and women.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.720]   - Men and women, and they have sauna
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.160]   where they can go in together.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.140]   And they also have separate saunas,
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:31.160]   but it's very much a Danish thing.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:36.160]   And I think it's good if people want that.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.320]   And I had it in my book because people want to know
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.480]   if they have to swim with their bathing suit on,
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.800]   or if they can take it off, or what's the difference?
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.200]   Is there any difference in this?
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.800]   And if you ask me, there is no difference.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:51.520]   If you have your little skinny bikini on,
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:54.920]   it's not gonna do any difference to your cold exposure
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.280]   or your adaptation, it's not gonna do any difference
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.040]   for your benefits, of course.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.240]   But I think that it has something else.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.280]   It has something to do with how you also observe yourself,
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.360]   how you observe your surroundings.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.240]   And it's some sense of freedom in skinny dipping.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.480]   So I think people in Denmark who does this,
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.480]   they do the winter swimming
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.600]   because they feel free when they do it.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.840]   They come home from work, they go to this club,
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.080]   and they skinny dip, and they feel in touch with nature.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.440]   And they have maybe done this their whole life.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.880]   So this is an old tradition in Denmark in some of the clubs.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:34.200]   But the newer clubs that are coming,
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.120]   they don't do a skinny dip.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.060]   So everyone has bathing suit.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:41.160]   I never skinny dip because there are people around,
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.580]   people with phones and taking pictures all the time.
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.800]   So this- - It's different nowadays.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.460]   Everything's recorded. - Yeah.
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:51.820]   And also this old tradition is also fading away
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:53.060]   because of that.
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.480]   - Yeah, I use sauna and cold at home,
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.260]   but when I travel, there's a banya.
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:03.360]   So Russian banya has hot sauna and cold plunge.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.920]   There's one in San Francisco called Archimedes banya.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.100]   And that one is clothing optional.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.000]   So some people are clothed, such as myself,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.060]   and then other people are not.
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.200]   And it's co-ed most of the time.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.160]   I think they have male, female separated evenings
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.160]   or something like that.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.500]   And then the other banya is Spa 88,
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.160]   which is on Wall Street in New York,
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.680]   is an amazing banya as well.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.680]   And these are starting to crop up in different cities,
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:27.980]   or maybe they've been there for a long time.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:30.440]   And as deliberate cold exposure and sauna gets more popular,
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.040]   more people are using them.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.040]   The one in New York that Spa 88 is always clothed.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.720]   And it's interesting because people here are naked
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.840]   or skinny dipping and they might get certain ideas in mind.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.560]   All these places are very well lit
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.200]   and they all have a tone of kind of health
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:53.360]   that is about the kind of health and wellness.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.200]   I guess the point being that there's no requirement
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.080]   to do one thing or the other.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.080]   Although in the studies that you did,
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.580]   obviously people were clothed.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:06.060]   But I did pay attention to those pages in your book.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:08.120]   I thought it was interesting that you put
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.360]   some dedicated passages in your book that related to this.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.680]   - My publisher wanted that.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.020]   - Oh, your publisher wanted that, interesting.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:14.860]   - It was not me.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.540]   It was like my publisher really wanted
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.360]   to have a little discussion about that.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.320]   So I was like, okay.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.680]   - Well, I think it points to a larger theme,
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.320]   which is I think for a lot of people
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.740]   who already do these practices, there's no shock there.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:32.400]   For people that do not do deliberate cold exposure or sauna,
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.940]   I think that there is this idea perhaps that,
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.780]   oh, these are traditions that are kind of fringe
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:40.620]   or that they're cut.
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:43.680]   And I just, I want to cue that point
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.180]   because there's so many things that are happening right now
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:48.660]   in biomedical research and medicine.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.620]   Serious quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:54.220]   published in excellent journals like your paper
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:56.900]   on things like deliberate cold exposure, sauna,
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:00.760]   the use of particular supplements,
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.100]   natural herbs and supplements.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.340]   I mean, there's an entire branch
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:07.160]   of the National Institutes of Health in the United States
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.480]   dedicated just to the study of supplements
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:11.220]   and behavioral interventions for health,
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.900]   like meditation and breath work.
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:14.120]   Really incredible. - Fantastic.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:14.960]   - It's really incredible.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.540]   And psychedelics, of course, being something
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.620]   that for a long time was part of a certain community
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:22.580]   and feel, and now is being frankly adopted
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:25.300]   by mainstream medicine, even pharma.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.640]   So the times are changing.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.100]   And so, yes, I think it's important to know
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.980]   that it's perfectly acceptable and encouraged
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.900]   to wear clothing.
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.460]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.620]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:40.700]   And one other thing that I wanted to mention,
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:43.140]   going back to your questions around
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.860]   with there were any observations in the studies,
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.340]   which we really maybe haven't discussed yet,
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.380]   and maybe it's in the back of the paper
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:54.260]   and not mentioned that much was one of the winter swimmers
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:57.220]   didn't have any brown fat when we measured him.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:58.980]   - Zero. - Zero.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.980]   And we do see this in previous studies as well,
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:07.780]   that some humans don't have any brown fat.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.780]   - Did he carry a lot of white fat adipose tissue?
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:11.020]   Was he obese?
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.280]   - No, he wasn't.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.020]   No, he was not obese because he would not have been
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.260]   in the study then.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.760]   - Oh, right, yes, you mentioned this earlier.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.600]   Forgive me.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.760]   - No, no, it's fine.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:23.780]   But what I did observe before I knew
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:26.060]   that he didn't have any brown fat was that
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.580]   during the cooling experiment where I cooled him
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:32.980]   for two hours before they go into the PET CT scanner,
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:39.100]   he was not able to control his shivering
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:42.580]   like the winter swimmers could.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:47.580]   So he got very cold very easily compared to the others.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:52.640]   So, and without, I didn't know what was different about him,
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.860]   but we could, all of me and the three others
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.420]   were working on the experiment.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.100]   We were like, okay, what's going on?
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.620]   Because we turned down the temperature,
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:05.220]   but he started shivering and then we had to turn it up again
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.580]   and it was just all over the place, the temperature.
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.820]   It wasn't that controlled like the others.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.180]   It was pretty similar protocol.
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.040]   I could just do pretty much the same
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.060]   because they were same size and also same gender.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:22.700]   So it was easier to foresee what was gonna happen
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.340]   and when will they start shivering.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:25.660]   I quickly learned that.
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:27.300]   But with this subject, it was just,
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:30.980]   with this volunteer was just very much different.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.300]   And then when we scanned him
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:33.580]   and didn't find any brown fat,
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:36.440]   I didn't even think about it.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.080]   So when we scanned him, we didn't see anything.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.220]   I told the PET CT people to like,
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.620]   oh, you put up the wrong scanning.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:44.820]   - Right, blame the technology.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.580]   - Yeah, the technology was like,
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.140]   this scanning looked like the thermo-neutral day,
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:51.280]   the thermo-comfortable day where we also scanned them
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.780]   to see if they have any brown fat.
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.300]   So you have made a mistake, I was pretty sure.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:59.500]   And they reanalyzed this scanning
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:03.180]   and they just concluded, well, the scanning was fine.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.700]   The experiment went well.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:08.540]   It was just that he didn't have any brown fat.
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.980]   So he was like what we just in the paper
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.060]   called a brown fat negative.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.480]   So he didn't have any.
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.500]   And in my studies, it would be called a knockout.
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.540]   So he didn't have any brown fat.
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:21.900]   So what the observation with him,
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.900]   and I think that's interesting,
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:27.020]   is that he both shivered very early on
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.140]   and didn't regulate his temperature as well.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:33.400]   He also told me that then he was like a five
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.460]   on the scale of how comfortable he felt with the cold.
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:44.320]   So it was from one to 10 and five being thermo-comfortable
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.320]   and 10 being very cold and one very hot.
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:52.860]   So on this like scale up and down.
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:55.700]   And he was like more up and down on this scale
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:56.620]   than any of the others.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.460]   It was an observation that I did.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:02.100]   But we did see in his blood samples also
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:04.000]   that his blood samples looked a bit more
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.240]   like the control group.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:10.660]   Also his insulin levels were like the control group.
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.700]   So a little bit higher than the other winter swimmers.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.700]   And he also had his blood glucose clearance
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:23.740]   was not as fast as the other winter swimmers.
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.980]   So he was like an outlier, what we call it.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:28.940]   And in the analysis, we also had to take him out
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:32.500]   of the analysis because he was an outlier.
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:36.020]   So the results showing that the brown fat
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:40.760]   is more efficiently activated in the winter swimmers
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.820]   is without him having him in that group.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:44.940]   - Got it. - But it didn't ruin
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:47.340]   the study if I tried to put him in as well.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:50.060]   And it didn't ruin the results or anything.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.100]   But just to keep it more clear,
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:54.540]   we took him out of the analysis.
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:56.960]   - Yeah, so he was a mutant, a knockout.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.820]   Yeah, and I'm sure they're out there.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:01.060]   Very interesting, so if you shiver early,
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.500]   then perhaps you have less brown fat to begin with.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.060]   Although it's hard to conclude from one person,
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.740]   that's sort of the implication there.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.500]   - Oh, you haven't adapted to the code.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.980]   So you should build that up, yeah.
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:16.060]   - So in addition to looking at regulation of blood sugar,
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:20.680]   brown fat, metabolism, and so on,
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.140]   were there any markers that you examined
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.580]   in the deliberate cold exposure group
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.180]   as compared to controls that revealed to you
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.420]   that deliberate cold exposure
[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:31.820]   could have additional benefits,
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:35.940]   say for immune system function
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.820]   or for any function for that matter?
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:41.700]   - Yeah, so we looked at inflammation.
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.000]   Of course, we measure the outcome of blood pressure
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.900]   and so on, but we also measured the IL-6 in the study
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.500]   just to see also an inflammatory, anti-inflammatory marker.
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:55.340]   So IL-6 went up and it also follows with the IL-10.
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.340]   So that is like also very known in the literature.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.060]   So we measured that and I think it's very important
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:05.020]   to think about the cold exposure and the heat exposure
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.900]   as something that then lowers the inflammation in the body.
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:11.360]   And if we can do that, we will have an open door
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:14.980]   for preventing lifestyle diseases, right?
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:17.660]   So for type 2 diabetes,
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:20.860]   but actually also for some mental diseases as well.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:23.380]   So as known as depression and anxiety
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.460]   and also Alzheimer's disease,
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.100]   which are all associated in research,
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:32.660]   also newer research showing that inflammation
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.940]   increases the risk of depression, anxiety,
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:37.100]   and Alzheimer's, if it's neurological diseases.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.220]   So if we can decrease inflammation in the body,
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.780]   we will decrease our modern lifestyle diseases,
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:47.340]   but also these increasing mental diseases
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:50.400]   that we see in these modern lifestyle times.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.700]   So I think that it's, I think it's very interesting
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.460]   that we can go out in nature
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:59.020]   and we can use these natural stressors.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.940]   And I don't want to have it sound very romantic or anything.
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:06.340]   It's just, it's just exposure to temperature actually,
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:09.720]   just a cold or to heat that is gonna twerk our body
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.740]   into a natural state again,
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:14.580]   and reset it where the homeostasis,
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:17.140]   the balance is lost a bit.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:20.500]   So the body is gonna repair itself in that way.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.620]   And I think it's beautiful that we can do that
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:24.860]   just by changing the temperature of our body.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.940]   And although people are very scared of doing this,
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:31.740]   because in our times we have been away from cold,
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:36.740]   away from heat, temperature for some, for decades now,
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:40.480]   since we isolated our houses better
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.560]   and we are more sedentary, we also sit more indoor,
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.980]   we don't move as much.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:49.920]   So this very modern sedentary lifestyle
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:53.320]   has made us more temperature comfortable, just neutral.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.140]   So no wonder, I mean, that obesity is increasing.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:01.140]   We don't expose ourselves to the natural stresses
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:04.940]   that we did earlier on in our involvement,
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:08.580]   but up until maybe the '70s, the '60s,
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:12.740]   where we started having more comfortable lifestyles, right?
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.540]   And obesity increases in the '80s,
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:17.100]   we can see that from statistics.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.860]   So I think that if we can take in cold and heat,
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:24.340]   and you mentioned other things also before,
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.940]   but of course, exercise is very important here.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.640]   And also a bit of fasting actually,
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.180]   because it all increases the hermetic stress in the body.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:36.380]   So it doesn't have to be other than natural stresses
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:38.180]   to the body, which then could keep us
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:39.980]   in that natural balance again.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:41.920]   - Could we talk about what I refer to
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:44.860]   as the Soberg principle, which is to end on cold.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.220]   And the reason I called it the Soberg principle
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:49.900]   is because in reviewing, oh, by the way,
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:52.660]   I wasn't a official reviewer of your paper,
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:55.580]   but I mean, in reading and reviewing your paper
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:58.660]   for its after published contents,
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.100]   I noticed that you had people end on cold.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.060]   And this has been a longstanding debate
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:05.980]   in the deliberate cold exposure community.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.500]   Should you warm up with a warm shower afterwards
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:09.540]   or get back in the sauna?
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.100]   What should you end on, end on cold or end on heat?
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:14.340]   And the Soberg principle says, end on cold,
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:18.340]   as I understand it, in order to force your body
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:23.260]   to heat itself back up and thereby increase metabolism
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:25.020]   further still, is that right?
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:28.640]   - Yes, so when you end on the cold,
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.620]   you force your body to heat up by itself.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.500]   And that will require that you activate,
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.680]   you keep your brown fat activated and also your muscles,
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.520]   which is a good thing.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.220]   It's a good collaboration to keep your thermogenesis up.
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:45.080]   And that's like an exercise, even when you go home.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:46.840]   So in that way, you don't have to think
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.660]   about your cold exposure dipping in your plunge,
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:53.160]   open sea or what it is,
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.160]   as just an exercise that you do for one to two minutes
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.320]   and then it's over.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.500]   If you end on the cold, you have an exercise
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.580]   for your body going on for hours afterwards.
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:05.300]   And that's not only on your metabolism,
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:08.460]   but it's also gonna keep your neurotransmitters
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:10.620]   activated as well and increase that
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.620]   because your body is still cold.
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.220]   So you need those neurotransmitters
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.100]   to activate the brown fat as well.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.820]   So that's gonna make your brown fat cells more efficient
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.700]   and also your muscle cells more efficient,
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:24.180]   so increasing mitochondria in the cells,
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.260]   which will then generate heat very fast.
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:28.980]   So if you have done this for a few times,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:33.360]   so maybe three, four, five times, being new to this,
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.260]   but have tried it a few times,
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:38.300]   you will notice a switch where you feel
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:42.660]   that you get easily warmer and you can keep yourself warmer.
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.180]   And that is also what was shown in my study
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.000]   is that the winter swimmers were physically warmer
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.740]   on the skin compared to the control group.
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.980]   - When they are out of the cold.
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:56.260]   - When they're out of the cold, just relaxing.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:59.120]   And we tested this on the days
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.820]   where they were sleeping in the lab.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.260]   So we could see that they had more activation
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.440]   of the brown fat, higher temperature.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.100]   So probably because they also lose heat,
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.740]   they have a higher heat loss to the body
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.140]   compared to the control group
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:17.660]   because they have a more vascular skin
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:20.160]   because of the contrast of cold and heat.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:23.940]   So they lose heat faster from the body during that day
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.920]   but is that a bad thing?
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.460]   No, probably not because that's going to keep your brown fat
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.140]   and your muscles a little bit activated.
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:36.140]   So you will have to, it has to work to keep you warm.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:38.980]   - And I would hypothesize that it also might lead
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:43.040]   to some of the subjectively reported improvements in sleep
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.280]   because in order to fall asleep,
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.880]   you need your core body temperature
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.300]   to drop by about one to three degrees.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.840]   So it's not just sufficient to be sleeping in a cold room
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:52.680]   and under the blanket,
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:55.380]   you also need your body temperature to drop.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:57.980]   And so what you're saying, if I understand correctly,
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:01.700]   is that by ending on cold and forcing oneself
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.160]   to heat up naturally, that increases the brown fat stores,
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:11.160]   which I sort of see as kind of like the oil in the candle
[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:14.240]   of the furnace that is thermogenesis.
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:18.780]   And that in turn leads to increased heat loss,
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:19.620]   which people might think,
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.940]   "Oh, I don't want to lose heat from the body."
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:23.760]   But there are times when we want to lose heat from the body.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.060]   Basically, it sounds like what we want
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:28.800]   is to be a very efficient heating and cooling system.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:31.260]   That it's not about being cold or being hot.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:34.800]   It's really about keeping the system tuned well,
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:38.260]   keeping the oil in the candle, this brown fat functioning.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:42.880]   Could I ask one question about fed or fasted?
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.740]   Is there any, or rather, are there any known benefits
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:50.820]   of doing deliberate cold exposure and or sauna fasted
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:55.340]   versus after a meal, say within the last hour
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.340]   or something of that sort?
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.900]   I do my deliberate cold exposure first thing in the morning.
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:02.140]   So in general, I'm fasted 'cause I don't eat
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:04.220]   until a little bit later in the day.
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:06.540]   But what's known about that?
[02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:07.940]   And was that looked at in your study?
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.180]   I know you measured glucose,
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:13.140]   but that was as a separate test away from the cold.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:14.520]   - Away from the cold, yeah.
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:17.860]   But I also tested glucose on the days on the cold.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.700]   So we measured that as well on the cooling days.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.700]   And specifically on fasting and fed, I don't know.
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:29.100]   I don't think that I have seen studies specifically on this.
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.800]   - Okay, more science needed.
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.660]   A number of people asked about the use
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:39.260]   of deliberate cold exposure to offset some of the symptoms
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:40.660]   of various diseases.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:42.380]   Now, here, we're not talking about curing disease.
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:45.000]   We're talking about offsetting symptoms.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.100]   One question I've seen quite often is whether or not
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:48.860]   people with Raynaud's syndrome.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:50.780]   - This is a syndrome, and my high school girlfriend
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:52.580]   had this syndrome, and I'll never forget.
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:55.180]   We were at a school dance together,
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.360]   and this was when we first started dating,
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.700]   and she had Raynaud's,
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:03.700]   which leads to very poor blood flow to the extremities.
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:08.340]   And she was very cold, so she left to go to the bathroom
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.500]   and warm up her hands in the warm water.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.220]   And I was left standing there at the dance,
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.260]   and people came up to me and asked why I was there
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:16.100]   and who I was there with.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.360]   And I kept telling them who I was with,
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.500]   and they didn't believe me
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.400]   'cause they couldn't believe that she would be with me.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.540]   Made total sense if you knew me at the time.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:27.340]   I was way out of my league with her at the time.
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.820]   I like to think eventually I caught up.
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.980]   But in any case, she was in the bathroom for about an hour.
[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:35.220]   So at one point I did consider the possibility
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:37.480]   that she had just left, but indeed she hadn't.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.520]   She warmed her hands back up.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.540]   But people with Raynaud's suffer from this thing
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.740]   of very, very cold extremities.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:47.740]   Their fingertips will even turn blue.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:50.580]   You know, as if they were starting to get frostbitten.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:52.340]   It's quite dramatic.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.980]   And that question gets asked whether or not
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:59.700]   there's any use of cold to try and increase the elasticity,
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:03.900]   the plasticity of the small capillaries and vessels.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:06.100]   By everything you've described up until now,
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:08.700]   it seems like that would be a logical thing to do.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:11.000]   And in addition to that,
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.520]   whether or not people with autoimmune conditions,
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:16.360]   people with any other types of conditions
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.960]   are known to benefit from deliberate cold exposure.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.380]   I'm not aware of any studies,
[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:21.860]   but I get asked about this a lot.
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:23.580]   And there were a lot of questions about this for you
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:24.620]   in the Twitter feed.
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.340]   - Yeah, thank you for those questions.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.660]   And I get them as well on social media.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:33.660]   And I have to say that I haven't seen any studies directed
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:37.700]   on this outcome on measuring Raynaud's syndrome.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:42.340]   I do know that it's not that rare actually a problem.
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:46.220]   And I know that many women or more women than men
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:47.260]   suffer from this.
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:51.080]   But logically it would help them
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:55.100]   if they expose their hands to cold and also heat
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:57.420]   to make it more vascular.
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:01.180]   And I have heard from people saying that it had helped them,
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.580]   but also heard from some others saying it didn't help them.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.680]   So studies are needed on this specific topic, I think.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.420]   I hurt my hands when I go into the cold one.
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:13.760]   I don't have this syndrome at all,
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:16.080]   but I keep my hands above the water.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:16.920]   - You do?
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:17.740]   - Yeah.
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:21.100]   I do that, often I take a little bit of a swim
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:24.480]   and then of course I have to have my hands in the water,
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.640]   but it helps me when I then get back to the daddy
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:31.420]   and then take my hands up because then I can stand there
[02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:35.300]   for a little bit and get my one to two minutes exposure.
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:38.500]   And then I can go up because then otherwise
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:42.460]   that would stop me from being in the water enough time
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:44.860]   that I, as long as I would like to.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:47.880]   So if people suffer from having this pain in the fingers
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:49.920]   and it can be very intense.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.880]   So just take the hands up a bit from the water
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.760]   and that's going to help you.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.560]   Also boots, neoprene boots, it's going to help on the feet.
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.500]   Some people have the hurt and feel the pain in the feet
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.000]   and on the ankles and that's going to help them
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.240]   also a little bit.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.360]   - Okay, so there is no problem with keeping hands out
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:13.360]   or feet in neoprene booties if people feel the need
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.720]   to do that.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.740]   If pain of the hands or feet is a barrier
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:20.420]   for people doing deliberate cold exposure,
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:23.280]   then it seems it would be okay to keep hands out
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.720]   or to keep your feet in the booties.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.820]   - Yes, because then you do get the exposure,
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:32.040]   but of course hands and feet are very potent places
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:35.880]   in your body to get a fast activation
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.700]   of your nervous system, of course.
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:40.900]   But you can also just dip them and then take them up.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:42.960]   It's still going to activate that,
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:47.400]   but you have your full body is covered in a coke receptors.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.520]   You'll have a full activation anyways, so yeah.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.580]   - You are providing very reassuring information to people
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:54.440]   'cause I know a number of people
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.500]   that do not like to put their hands in.
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.980]   I find that the more of my body I get in,
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:01.360]   the more comfortable I am.
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.020]   I don't know if it's psychologically and or physiologically.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:06.880]   I find that where there's an interface
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:10.560]   between the water and the cold, it's most uncomfortable.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.000]   So I prefer to just get everything under.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:12.840]   I keep my head out.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.840]   Although these days I've been dunking all the way in
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.040]   and then coming out and then dunking once more
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:20.360]   with my head under before I get out after the plunge.
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.220]   That raises a different question.
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:23.960]   Now we're getting into kind of the practicalities
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:27.480]   of deliberate cold exposure, which I think are important.
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.920]   Sometimes I'll experience, and I hear from a lot of people
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.960]   that they'll get a kind of back of the head headache
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.200]   at the interface of the water
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:40.080]   when they're doing cold immersion to the neck.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.340]   I assume this has to do with blood flow,
[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:44.920]   that there's vasoconstriction right up until the neck
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:46.520]   and in the region surrounding it,
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.460]   but that maybe there's still blood flow to the head.
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:52.260]   But do we know what the origin of these headaches is?
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:53.920]   And again, this doesn't happen for everybody,
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:55.720]   but some people do experience them.
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:56.560]   - Okay, yeah.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.400]   I haven't really heard about that one specifically.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:04.140]   But I would say that there are different reasons
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:06.440]   for maybe keeping your head out of the water.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.160]   But it seems like maybe for some,
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:11.920]   that could be a reason for just getting a quick head dunk.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.200]   - Going all the way in.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.160]   That's what I've started doing to eliminate.
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:19.200]   I wasn't getting headaches, but I noticed that interface.
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:23.200]   And I wasn't in the rest of the experience of it so much.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.680]   So I started dunking all the way in.
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:27.120]   I noticed in some of the photos that you've put out
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.840]   and in your book that you'll sometimes wear a cap
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.680]   while you go in.
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.780]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:35.900]   - And well, it comes from different reasons.
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:38.940]   So let's talk about some of the physiological reasons.
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:43.200]   So when you submerge in cold water up to the neck,
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.340]   studies have shown, and this is from Denmark,
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:47.980]   studies from BSPBI hospital,
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:51.080]   that when you submerge into cold water up to the neck
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:55.700]   at zero degrees, so zero degrees Celsius, very cold,
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.180]   you will have a decreased blood flow to the brain
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:01.300]   by around 30 to 40%.
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:02.800]   And it makes sense because you activate
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:04.300]   the sympathetic nervous system.
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:07.380]   And therefore you will have less blood flow to the brain.
[02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:09.160]   It makes you maybe a little bit dizzier.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.960]   - Proof again that you need a heart more than a brain
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:15.180]   because when the sympathetic nervous system gets activated,
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.620]   blood flow is maintained to the heart to keep you alive,
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:19.120]   but obviously taken away from the brain
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.340]   to keep you from thinking.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:22.280]   That's why it's hard to think when you're stressed.
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:25.080]   - Yeah, well, the muscles and your vital organs need to,
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:28.360]   you have to be able to run away from that tiger, right?
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.040]   - The rationale makes total sense.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:32.460]   And who am I to disagree with mother nature?
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:36.340]   - Well, but yeah, so one of the reasons being
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.380]   that you should keep your head out of the water
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:42.780]   is that you could increase that decrease
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:46.420]   in blood flow to the brain further if you dunk the head.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:48.460]   So there's just a very nice paper
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.940]   from a research group in Canada
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.400]   where they have collectively looked at different papers
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:59.100]   where they compared heat loss in a group,
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.160]   in the papers where they dunk the head
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:05.500]   and compared to heat loss, submerging up to the neck
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:09.640]   to see how much extra heat do we lose from our core
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:11.080]   when we dunk the head.
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.080]   So, and I think it's very interesting
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.000]   that if you submerge up to the neck,
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.640]   you have a heat loss of 11% from the body core.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.320]   And when you then also dunk the head,
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:27.320]   you will increase that heat loss rate by 36%.
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:31.400]   So that means, I'm not saying that, I'm not here to say
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.880]   what is right and what is wrong.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:35.740]   I just think that people should know the information
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.960]   so they can for themselves evaluate what is best for them.
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:43.340]   But if you increase your heat loss rate by 36%
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:47.040]   from your core, that's gonna increase your after drop,
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:49.920]   which we touched upon a little bit earlier, even further.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.680]   So that's meaning that you are closer to hypothermia
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:56.440]   than you are if you just submerge up to the neck.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:59.080]   So you should really think about whether this is like
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.760]   something that you want to do,
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.520]   or if it's just better for you
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:05.200]   not to get that cold in your core.
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:08.520]   The beanie is also because I have a little bit
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:11.580]   of sensitive ears, so meaning that if there's wind,
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:14.160]   and because we swim in the open sea in Denmark,
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:15.720]   we have a lot of wind.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:20.720]   Our conditions are just very rainy, very windy,
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.000]   and when the temperature is also freezing,
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.240]   you could get this, what is that called?
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.840]   So very cold and lightheaded just from wind.
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:33.960]   So if you also submerge into cold water and you then get up,
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:36.680]   you will get a brain freeze immediately.
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:39.780]   So it is enough to just go up to the neck,
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.440]   wear a beanie to just not get dizzy also
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.920]   because the heat loss is increased, of course,
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:50.080]   but also the blood flow to the brain has decreased.
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.120]   So the beanie will keep you a little bit warmer
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:53.520]   so you can stay for one to two minutes.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:55.960]   So it's just a way of getting around
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:57.900]   some of the conditions also.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:00.260]   So people can choose that if they feel that,
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:04.880]   but it's quite normal to do in Scandinavia wear a beanie.
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:06.280]   - Love it.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:09.120]   So for those of you afraid of doing a two-minute cold shower
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.880]   what Dr. Silberg just described,
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:15.760]   you see how she and others are capable
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.200]   of doing things far harder than that.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.860]   When the way you describe it with the cold wind
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:24.360]   in Scandinavia is quite striking.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.260]   Along the lines of covering the head,
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:30.740]   there's this seemingly paradoxical thing
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:35.480]   of people going into hot saunas and wearing wool caps.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.820]   You know, if you go to a banya or you go to a sauna
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:43.080]   and there are people who are, well, from Eastern Europe
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:48.080]   or typically are Finland or Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere,
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:50.080]   what you'll see is that many of them are wearing wool caps
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:53.220]   in the sauna, which many people think is to make it hotter.
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:54.260]   That's actually not the case.
[02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:57.080]   It actually insulates you from the heat environment.
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:00.960]   The sense of urgency to get out of the hot sauna
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.220]   is a brain-driven mechanism.
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:06.880]   And so the reason that people wear wool hats in the sauna
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:09.680]   is it actually lets you stay in the sauna longer
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:12.220]   because it takes a lot of heat to the skin
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:15.880]   before you feel that you have to get out.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:18.800]   Whereas so when you insulate the brain,
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.720]   you don't get that signal.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.560]   It's pretty interesting.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.800]   I've tried this before just by putting a towel over my head
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.820]   in the sauna and you can stay in there much more easily
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.140]   and for much longer.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:31.480]   You know, as we talk about these different stimuli
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.040]   for the hormetic response, the adaptation distress,
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.880]   you know, it occurs to me that the big ones
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.960]   in our evolutionary history have been light, right?
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.120]   I mean, you were talking about seasonal changes.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.120]   We know there, especially as you go up to Nordic countries,
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:49.760]   there are seasonal changes in the amount of light
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:52.740]   by time of year, dramatic ones, in fact,
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:55.520]   less so at the equator, of course.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:00.520]   Light, temperature, food, movement.
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:02.160]   And it's sort of interesting.
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.560]   And at the same time,
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.220]   perhaps it should have been obvious to us
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:10.220]   that there are stimuli that our bodies have evolved
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.200]   to adapt to in very powerful ways.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:17.000]   And so the idea that temperature, heat, and cold
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.920]   could evoke these tremendous physiological changes
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.720]   that are beneficial for us
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:23.440]   probably shouldn't surprise us at all.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.640]   I mean, this is why,
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.680]   I mean, these are not esoteric mechanisms.
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:31.120]   They're actually the foundational mechanisms
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.560]   by which our body and the bodies of other animals adapt.
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.040]   So I do have a question about the different ways
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.700]   that people could approach deliberate cold exposure.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:45.640]   So for instance, children.
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:48.460]   I've been to banyas where there are kids
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.460]   six or seven years old with their parents at the banya.
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.360]   And so they're in hot sauna.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.640]   I'm not suggesting people do this
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.560]   if they're not adapted to it.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.220]   And talk to your parents' kids
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:01.660]   and talk to your kids' parents, talk to your doctors.
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.880]   But it is remarkable.
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:05.940]   I mean, children doing sauna from a young age
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.740]   or deliberate cold exposure.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:09.660]   Are there any data on this and is it safe,
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:12.100]   assuming that, you know, obviously that they can swim
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.400]   and or they're doing this in a tub or shower?
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:17.460]   And then I'd also like to ask you about,
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:20.440]   are there any additional male, female differences?
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:23.120]   I know your study focused on men,
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.040]   but other studies have focused on both.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:28.240]   And you of course are a woman
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.040]   and can attest to your own experience with this.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.880]   So children, men, women,
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:36.040]   differences there in terms of protocols.
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:37.440]   Is there anything that people should build
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.940]   into the structure of their deliberate cold exposure
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:41.280]   that's unique to that?
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.920]   - So yeah, so this was on cold exposure.
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.620]   So yeah, I think that,
[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:51.380]   starting with the question about children,
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:54.880]   I think that it's important to think about,
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.360]   as children are smaller than adults,
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.600]   so we cannot really completely transfer all the information
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.580]   and the benefits and also protocols for how long
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:06.680]   and stuff like that to children.
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:09.640]   We cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:13.760]   And one study that actually improves this
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:18.200]   is a study where they have compared heat loss
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.420]   in children, boys who were 12 years old
[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:25.960]   compared to adults, men,
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.560]   and looked at heat loss of the core temperature
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.560]   and exposed them to one or two minutes cold exposure,
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:38.080]   so immersion up to the neck.
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.040]   And what they saw was that the boys in this study
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.480]   could actually defend the core temperature
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:47.960]   in the same way as the adults could,
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.840]   but they had to use their muscles way faster.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.840]   So it means that they couldn't stay for as long
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:58.840]   and they use more energy to defend their core temperature
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.280]   compared to the adults.
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:04.040]   But for one minute, it seems that they could actually,
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.120]   but they will be colder when they then come out
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.520]   because they are smaller in their mass to their ratio.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.200]   So it means that if the surface is so large on children
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.000]   and their mass and muscles being smaller to that ratio,
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.120]   it means that they can be in the water less time
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:26.280]   before they get hypothermic.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.240]   So just think about that.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:29.100]   They are just smaller.
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:32.880]   They can't defend their temperature for a very long time.
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.160]   But in this study, they saw that for up to,
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.000]   I think it was a minute or so they could-
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.200]   - One minute. - One minute, yeah.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:39.600]   - I'm glad you mentioned hypothermia
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.680]   in smaller bodied people, children.
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:47.000]   I used to do some Pacific ocean swims in the morning
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.480]   without wetsuits and I adapted to it pretty quickly.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.080]   And these are fairly long swims
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:53.800]   and we brought an excellent swimmer with us
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:58.160]   that was interning with me for a while.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:01.960]   He's 16 years old at the time and very lean.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:04.120]   And he wasn't small for his age,
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.600]   but he was smaller than us,
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.220]   than it was all guys on the swim that day.
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:10.240]   Sometimes women join us.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.080]   And he got hypothermic and he's an excellent swimmer.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.580]   And he didn't report feeling overly cold,
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:21.960]   but fortunately we got him to shore and heated him up again.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:23.040]   So he lived.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:24.580]   I don't think his mother is going to ever let him
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:25.640]   go swimming with us again.
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:26.840]   He's thriving in the world.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.680]   He's a university student now and he recalls that swim.
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:32.560]   I mean, this is why you always want to ocean swim
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.300]   with a buddy, with people.
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:37.520]   Yeah, he became hypothermic.
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:39.080]   His teeth turned yellow.
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:40.640]   He was kind of slurring his words.
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:42.360]   He wasn't making sense.
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.020]   We got him onto shore and he was kind of drooling
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:47.840]   and a little semi euphoric and then kind of,
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:50.160]   hypothermia is no joke.
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:53.520]   So I think, yeah, so I'm really glad that this is coming up
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:55.560]   because the cold is a powerful stimulus
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.640]   and kids are at a, and smaller bodied people
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:01.520]   are at a greater risk of hypothermia.
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:03.740]   So a good reason to approach it with caution,
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:07.120]   maybe start with cold showers, get then cold immersion
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.840]   and still water, natural water and open bodies of water.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:12.320]   Of course, they're always going to be more dangerous
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:14.840]   for other reasons, currents and things of that sort.
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.500]   Okay. - And drowning, yeah.
[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.200]   - So important note there.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:21.760]   What about any additional male, female differences
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.080]   or similarities that we should be aware of?
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:26.400]   And this comes up all the time on social media.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:28.640]   Anytime I post anything about a study,
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.600]   it's what about women?
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:31.560]   Because oftentimes there are differences.
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:32.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.240]   And we also just talked about the difference
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.600]   in temperature in men and women.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.600]   So it means that if we replicated my study in women,
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:48.360]   it could be that they would have enough,
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.480]   you can say cold exposure with just nine minutes per week.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:56.440]   It could be because they apparently are also just colder
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.980]   and they have increased metabolism in their brown fat.
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:01.760]   It's just they have more brown fat.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.760]   It could be, but this is just something
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:06.080]   that I frankly don't know.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.000]   But women also do cold exposure winter swimming
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.560]   with the 11 minutes protocol.
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:15.080]   I do it myself and feel good about it.
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:19.720]   So I would say that women also regarding activation
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:24.040]   of the brown fat, it should be the same in theory,
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.600]   but I don't know if women actually do need
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:29.320]   to have another protocol when it comes
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.960]   to this rapid cold exposure.
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:33.600]   I think that it's another question
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:35.920]   if we are talking about ice swimming,
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:38.920]   when it comes to how far can you be in the cold water
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:40.520]   without getting hypothermic,
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:44.720]   then there will be differences in men and female.
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:47.040]   But if you do this cold exposure
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.800]   for a very brief amount of time,
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:52.560]   which is what I try to talk about,
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.720]   what we call also microstressing the body
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:58.040]   to increase the hematics stress, the healthy stress,
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:02.480]   then this is such a short amount of exposure
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:04.280]   that it's fairly the same.
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.120]   I think women can look at this
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.040]   as a fairly good protocol for them as well.
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.920]   - I always say that if you really dread the cold
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:17.680]   and don't like the cold, then you are a perfect candidate
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:19.280]   for using deliberate cold exposure
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:22.240]   because the sympathetic, aka the stress response,
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:25.720]   will be greater and thereby the adaptation
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.720]   to that shorter one or two minutes
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:31.480]   is going to be much greater, right?
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:33.740]   For people that are perfectly comfortable in the cold,
[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:36.120]   it's harder to get an adaptation response,
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:37.740]   the same way that if somebody is very strong
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:39.920]   and they can lift a very heavy weight,
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:41.880]   that very heavy weight is unlikely to evoke
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:46.440]   the same kind of, or same degree of adaptive responses
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:47.880]   if somebody is not quite as strong.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:51.920]   So another reason to keep these exposures relatively short
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:53.400]   and more frequent
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.380]   than to do longer duration exposures frequently.
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:00.640]   However, let's say somebody only had two days a week
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:03.860]   to do deliberate cold exposure.
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:06.600]   Maybe they don't have access to a sauna, maybe they do.
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:09.520]   Would you suggest that they get in for one or two minutes,
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:13.200]   then get out, then get back in for another couple of minutes,
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.520]   then get out and call that for four or five minutes
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.720]   to try and get to that 11 minutes total per week,
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:23.760]   as opposed to getting in for a full five minutes
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:26.340]   and then getting out and coming back a second time that week.
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:28.040]   I know this is getting down into the weeds,
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:29.180]   but these are the sorts of things
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:30.620]   that I think people really want to know
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:33.200]   because a lot of people either don't live close
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:37.360]   to a body of water or don't have a cold plunge
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.780]   that they can do this with,
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:41.040]   although cold shower apparently works too.
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.600]   So most people live close to a shower.
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:46.920]   - Yeah, so definitely, I think the changes in temperature
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:51.920]   is what is strengthening your cells in the body.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:55.320]   So if you can do the short amount of exposure
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:57.360]   and then get out and get back in,
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.960]   that is gonna, you can say, strengthen your cells
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:04.120]   because you are challenging them
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:08.240]   to adapt to changing temperatures.
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:11.720]   So doing one session, you can change this, right?
[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:14.780]   You can do it if you are able to go to cold water,
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.360]   but also a sauna, then you just do it that automatically
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:19.120]   and you will have a change in temperature.
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:21.680]   But you could also do it by variating the temperature
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:24.680]   in your cold plunge if you have a plunge
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:28.360]   or if you have the open sea or you have seasons even,
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.080]   we have that in Denmark, so we have four seasons
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.360]   and the temperature is gonna vary with that.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.560]   So we have nature who can just change this for us
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:37.840]   and we don't have to think about it.
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:40.400]   But if you have a cold plunge, well, then I would say
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.200]   that changing the temperature is what is gonna create
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:47.600]   this hermetic stress and also keep your cells on its toes,
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:52.600]   you can say, because the body will still be stressed
[02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:55.980]   to try to adapt to the new temperature
[02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:59.100]   as it's seen as something actually toxic to the body, right?
[02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:02.400]   It's a small piece of toxicity
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:05.020]   that you are exposing yourself to.
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:06.040]   You don't have to swallow it,
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:08.460]   but it's enough that you touch it actually.
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:10.720]   - Yeah, great way to frame it.
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:15.360]   That brings me back to this idea of circadian time.
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:19.480]   In your study, you didn't control for a specific time of day
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.000]   and now I'm realizing that may be a great asset
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.020]   to the whole thing.
[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:25.320]   So we know, for instance, that our bodies go through
[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:27.240]   pretty dramatic shifts in temperature
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.960]   from the time we wake up, our body starts heating up
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.240]   as we wake up and continues to heat until the afternoon
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:35.020]   and then starts to drop in the later afternoon
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:38.560]   and then assuming all things are working correctly,
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:41.140]   that body temperature drops and we sleep.
[02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:43.540]   So I could imagine that doing deliberate cold exposure
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:47.300]   at different times just by way of convenience
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:49.740]   or by way of intention could be very beneficial
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:51.160]   because my body temperature is going to be
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:54.000]   quite a bit warmer at one time of day versus another
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.320]   and in that way, keeping the system tuned.
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:59.100]   And that's really what I keep hearing coming through
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:02.100]   as you explain these data and all these beautiful studies,
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:04.880]   yours and others, is that it's not really
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.120]   about getting cold.
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:09.240]   It's about going from warm to cold and from cold to warm.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:14.060]   And I love this idea because,
[02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:16.800]   I probably said this a hundred times on my podcast
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.940]   and a million times in my life and I'll continue to,
[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:21.820]   which is that biology is not an event, it's a process.
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:26.080]   Like these metabolic and thermoregulatory processes
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.240]   are indeed like the turning of a knob.
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:31.060]   It's a verb as opposed to a noun.
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:35.260]   And so I think if people can internalize that idea,
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:38.020]   that they're going to have a lot more flexibility,
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:40.500]   a lot more fun and get a lot more benefit
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:41.340]   as opposed to thinking,
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:44.100]   okay, I need to get into X degrees of water
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:47.920]   for X amount of time on X number of days
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.320]   in a very rigid way. - And I get this question
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:51.980]   all the time, how much and how cold.
[02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:54.820]   And I mean, it's just like, well,
[02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:57.180]   because we also don't have studies showing exactly
[02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:59.920]   if you just keep five degrees in your water
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:02.860]   and you do that for a month, then what happens?
[02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:05.000]   Maybe in the future, we will know much more about this
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.060]   and I'm sure it's going to come and I really hope so.
[02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:12.180]   But I just think by logically changing that temperature
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:13.340]   up and down, up and down,
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:14.820]   and you also do that in your water,
[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:17.420]   it doesn't really, it's not that important
[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:19.620]   what temperature you will have your water then,
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:21.700]   then just keep changing it, going up and down.
[02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:24.340]   It could be all up to 12 degrees Celsius.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:26.200]   You're going to activate your brown fat anyways.
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.340]   I mean, 12, 19 degrees cold air
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.100]   is enough to activate your brown fats.
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:34.740]   So maybe we don't have to go as cold
[02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:37.100]   as I think many people think
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:41.820]   and putting ice even all the time, you don't have to.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:44.760]   I don't think it's necessary to expose yourself
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:49.760]   to that cold temperature all the time, but vary it a bit.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.460]   - So keep the system off balance.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:52.300]   - Yes, off balance. - It's the way
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:53.260]   to keep it tuned.
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:54.100]   - Yeah.
[02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:57.340]   - You mentioned a study that is more recent
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:59.700]   or an ongoing that's not published.
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:02.900]   If you're willing, could you share maybe some of the data
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:07.660]   from that findings from that study with of course the cue
[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:10.300]   to everybody that these are not yet published data
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:11.880]   so that the conclusions could change,
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.820]   the data could change for that matter.
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:16.820]   - Yeah, so we haven't analyzed all the data yet.
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.620]   And I know from the study that we did publish
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:24.380]   that we would need to look more at the data.
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:27.340]   So I don't really have any results yet that I can share
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:30.500]   because we are still in very preliminary analysis of this.
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:34.300]   So I wouldn't know yet what to exactly say about it.
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:36.980]   But what we looked at was both men and women method.
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:38.780]   So that's coming.
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:40.340]   - Oh, that's fantastic.
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:43.260]   That answer is going to please a great number of people
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:44.980]   and intrigue everybody.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:50.620]   Well, listen, I want to really thank you
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:54.980]   for coming here today to talk about your work
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:58.700]   and the incredible direction that it points to.
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:03.260]   Because I think that no one study is definitive,
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:07.180]   but your study really, again, stands as a landmark
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:10.940]   in the landscape of exploring deliberate cold exposure
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:13.420]   and heat, how it can impact
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:15.460]   and potentially impact our health.
[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.780]   Because frankly, there just haven't been
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:22.780]   that many high resolution, detailed modern studies of this.
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:24.200]   There have been studies of sauna.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:25.480]   There've been some studies of cold.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:26.820]   There are a lot of groups in physiology
[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:30.840]   that work on hypothermia and very cold exposure.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.160]   But most of the temperatures used in those days
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.160]   just aren't practical.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:35.900]   So first of all, I just want to thank you
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:37.460]   for doing the work that you've done
[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:38.940]   and for the work that you continue to do.
[02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:43.420]   I'm waiting with bated breath, as they say,
[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:46.460]   to hear the results of this study
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.100]   that's ongoing on both men and women.
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:51.620]   So we'll have to have you back to inform us about that soon.
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:52.480]   And I want to thank you
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:55.500]   for the incredible public education efforts
[02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:57.780]   that you've been doing on social media
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:01.240]   and with respect to your book.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:04.280]   And we, of course, we'll put links to all of those things
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.640]   in the show note caption so people can learn from you
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.220]   and can continue to learn from you.
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:11.020]   We certainly need more scientists
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:14.660]   who are both experienced with doing hardcore research,
[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:18.840]   as it's called, and who also do the practices.
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:21.460]   I think that's a wonderful additional asset.
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:22.780]   You're not just behind a lab coat
[02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:26.760]   or bundled up in a down feather jacket
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.020]   as everyone else is getting into the cold.
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:29.380]   You do these things.
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:32.120]   And that you are so open and generous
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:34.380]   in the way that you share knowledge,
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:35.660]   which includes coming here today
[02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:38.620]   to share knowledge with me and our audience.
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.900]   So thank you ever so much.
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:41.900]   - You're very welcome.
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:43.260]   I am so pleased to be here
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:44.800]   and thank you so much for inviting me.
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:46.740]   And I could explain my study
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:50.060]   and I can share some of my insights from doing that.
[02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:52.540]   So I'm very grateful for being here.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.520]   Delighted, and we'll have to have you back again.
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.420]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:58.980]   all about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:01.780]   science and protocols with Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:04.340]   If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Soberg's research,
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:05.840]   or you would like to learn about the research
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.220]   of her institute, the Soberg Institute,
[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:10.640]   please see the links in the show note caption.
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.860]   Also in the show note caption,
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.500]   you can find a link to Dr. Soberg's excellent book,
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.740]   Winter Swimming.

[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:32.060]   If you have questions for me
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:34.960]   or topics you'd like me to cover on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:36.820]   or guests that you'd like me to consider inviting
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:38.300]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:40.460]   please put that in the comments on YouTube.
[02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.500]   I do read all the comments.
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:44.820]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.660]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:48.900]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:50.380]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:52.920]   but on various previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:54.460]   we discuss supplements.
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:56.360]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.420]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:01.440]   for things like enhancing sleep, focus, and hormone support.
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.340]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.720]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:06.460]   If you'd like to hear more about the supplements
[02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:08.200]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:12.220]   please go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S, .com/huberman.
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:14.900]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:17.120]   If you're not already following the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:20.520]   on social media, we are Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:22.360]   Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.180]   And on all those places, I focus on material
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:26.880]   that somewhat overlaps with content
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:28.120]   from the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:29.960]   but often is distinct from the content
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:31.440]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:34.440]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:36.240]   For those of you that haven't already subscribed
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:38.280]   to our so-called neural network newsletter,
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:41.380]   this is a completely zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:43.600]   that has summaries of podcast episodes
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:44.920]   and so-called toolkits.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:48.840]   Toolkits are lists of about a page to two pages long
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:50.420]   that give the critical tools,
[02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:52.400]   for instance, for optimizing sleep
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.480]   or for neuroplasticity or deliberate cold exposure
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:29:56.700]   or deliberate heat exposure, optimizing dopamine.
[02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:59.080]   Again, all available to you at zero cost.
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:01.080]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:03.080]   go to the Menu tab in the corner,
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:04.320]   scroll down to Newsletter.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:05.320]   You provide us your email.
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:07.480]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:10.760]   And in addition to that, there are samples of toolkits
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:14.080]   on the HubermanLab.com website, again, under Newsletter.
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:16.240]   And you don't even have to sign up to access those.
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.640]   But I think most people do end up signing up
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:18.480]   for the newsletter
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:20.240]   because it's rich with useful information
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:21.880]   and again, completely zero cost.
[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:23.160]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:25.840]   for today's discussion with Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.940]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:29.780]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:32.360]   [upbeat music]
[02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:34.940]   (upbeat music)
