[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of the 84th Psalm,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.280]   dealing perhaps particularly tonight with the first three verses.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.320]   The first three verses in the 84th Psalm.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.560]   How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.160]   My soul, longeth yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord;
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.520]   My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.840]   Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:55.000]   Where she may lay her young, even thine orphans, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.040]   Now here, as you noticed in the reading at the beginning, and as you recollect this psalm
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.360]   and its great message, the psalmist is praising and thanking God for all the blessings of
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   the godly and of the religious life.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.480]   It is generally agreed that this was probably a psalm written by King David, and written
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.520]   probably at the time of the rebellion of his own son Absalom, when everything, as it were,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   was going against David, and when it seemed very doubtful whether he'd ever return to
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.560]   Jerusalem again and ever have the privilege of reigning any more as king.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.640]   It is probably such a psalm written by David at such a time.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:56.800]   But here he is thanking God, thanking God for all that he, God, meant to David, and
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   for everything that he'd ever received from him, and even going so far as to say, "I
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   would sooner be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'd rather," he says in effect, "be a fugitive, as I am at this moment, and escaping
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.400]   for my life, and out in the wilderness, rather than be in the very center of the godless
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.720]   life and enjoying what it regards as its greatest pleasures."
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.120]   Now it's therefore a very notable psalm, because it is a psalm of experience.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.160]   It isn't something theoretical.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.480]   It isn't a man just theorizing about life, but it's a man talking about life as he
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.520]   experienced it, as he was experiencing it at that very moment, and especially as he
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.880]   was experiencing at its very worst, and when it was doing its very worst against him.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.360]   So therefore I commend it to you, because it does seem to me, to teachers, what are
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.600]   some of the very elements and first principles of religion, or of the Christian life, call
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.360]   it which you will.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.720]   And therefore if we but take the trouble to analyze it and to listen to what the psalmist
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   has got to say, we shall arrive at this understanding which is so necessary.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.920]   Now then let me put it to you all at once and briefly this evening in the form of a
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.680]   question.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   Are you able to react to life when it's at its worst and darkest, as David did in
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.360]   this way?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.680]   When everything seems to be against you, as the hymn writer puts it, when all things seem
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.720]   against us to drive us to despair, when you're facing treachery perhaps, as David was, the
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.640]   treachery of a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a friend, a trusted companion, there's
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   nothing worse than that.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.720]   But even when you're facing that sort of thing, how do you react to it?
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   You see how David reacted?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.360]   These are his terms, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.280]   Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they will be ever praising thee.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.480]   O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob."
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.200]   And then he ends off.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.560]   It's so wonderful that he can't stop saying it, "O Lord of hosts," he says, "blessed
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.760]   is the man that trusteth in thee."
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   You see, he is rejoicing.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   He is very happy, in spite of circumstances, in spite of life, in spite of everything.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.800]   Now I say that the whole question therefore confronting us is just this.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.120]   Are we able to speak like this?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.280]   We really have no religion, truly speaking, if we can't say this.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.420]   This is the true godly religious life.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.860]   This is Christianity.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.860]   This is its object.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.860]   This is its purpose.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.320]   This is what it is meant for and designed to do.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.780]   Well, very well, I say, let us follow the psalmist in his account and description.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:49.120]   And especially as he gives us his reasons and his explanations.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.720]   That is one of the great things about this psalm, and as it is about many of these psalms,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.760]   that the man not only gives his experience, but he analyzes it.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   He leads us to understand it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   He expounds it to us.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:15.160]   And the result of that is that if we but follow what he says, we shall then, I say, be able
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   to arrive.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.960]   Now, there is no need for any more to go out.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.760]   You have been very slow in going out, all of you, but now quite a number have gone.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.360]   I really wondered whether anybody was going, but there is no need for any more.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.200]   All right, well, now let us come back again to our psalm.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.080]   The psalmist, you see, has a true understanding and diagnosis of life.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.320]   And as I am saying, he takes the trouble to analyze it for us and to show us these great
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:55.000]   principles without which we can never arrive at this position and experience in which he
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.920]   rejoices so much.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.080]   Very well then, what is the method?
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.600]   What is it that we have to observe?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.580]   Well, the first thing clearly must be this.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:22.000]   We must have some understanding of the very nature and the character of religion.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.200]   I put this first because the psalmist puts it first.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   I put it first also and obviously because it is a failure to see the importance of this
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.440]   that accounts for so many troubles in the Christian life and for the fact that so many
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.360]   people never become Christian at all.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:51.960]   It is this fundamental and initial inability to really see what it really is all about.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.920]   Now then, I have already put it in a very practical form to you.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.960]   Do we say this evening, are we able to say with this method, "Blessed is the man that
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.360]   trusteth in thee"?
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.000]   Can we join him in saying, "How amiable are thy tabernacles"?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.920]   Now the psalmist, you see, he puts it in terms of his worshipping in the tabernacle or perhaps
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.840]   in the temple.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.600]   The Old Testament always puts it in that form because men met together, as we still
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.920]   do, to worship God and to pray.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.440]   What he says for the common act of worship is equally true of the private and of the
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   individual.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.600]   But he puts it like this in terms of temple worship or tabernacle worship, and that is
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.040]   why he puts it in terms of the amiability of the tabernacles of the Lord.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.480]   Well let me put it like this personally and individually.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.760]   Are you enjoying religion?
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.480]   Is this the chiefest thing to you?
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.280]   Is this the thing which holds you and sustains you and fills you with joy and rejoicing even
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.960]   when everything has gone against you?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   That's what it's for.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.600]   That is what it is meant to do.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.960]   Come let me put it in another term which he uses here and which I hope to refer to on
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   a later occasion.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.080]   Can you say tonight that you are like the sparrow that has found a house?
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.640]   Or are you like a swallow that at last has found a nest?
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.680]   Have you come to the point of rest and of peace and of satisfaction?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.880]   Very well I say, the way to discover all that is to look at his principles.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:51.640]   And he starts with this general statement about the whole character and nature of religion.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.960]   Let me put it to you simply this evening in the form of a number of propositions.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.240]   The first is this.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.680]   Religion consists of, or in, the knowledge of God.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.720]   That's the thing this man is talking about, isn't it?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   The knowledge of God.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.560]   Now there is nothing which is more remarkable than the way in which that which is the first
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.120]   principle is so frequently and so regularly forgotten.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.280]   It's almost incredible, but there are large numbers of people who have what we may describe
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.440]   as a religion without God.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.800]   And there is such a thing possible.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.480]   You can have religion without God, but it isn't this true religion about which this
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   man is speaking.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.440]   For the very essence of religion, I say, is to know God.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.920]   Now let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.640]   There are large numbers of people still left in this country even today to whom religion
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.000]   is nothing but a part of the social realm.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   It is the thing to do to go to a place of worship perhaps on Sunday morning, or perhaps
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.840]   with others on Sunday evening.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.120]   They have done it all their lives.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   Why?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.520]   Well, they were brought up to do so, they were taught to do so, they have never taken
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.960]   the trouble to think as to why they are doing it.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   They have never asked any questions about it.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.200]   It's a part of the realm, it's the thing to do, it's always been done, and they go on
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   doing it.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.480]   They have never had a single thought about God.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.080]   They hear his name, they hear the scriptures read, they hear the prayers read and repeated,
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.760]   but they never have really thought about God and their relationship to God.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   It's purely and simply a part of the social realm and the thing to do.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.440]   They obviously are not able to use this language of the Sarmis, because they have not even
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.120]   thought enough even to realize that that is the essence of it all.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:05.960]   They certainly can never turn to God and say, "My King and my God."
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.620]   It's a religion without God.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.160]   But then there are others to whom, as you know, it's just a question of conduct and
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.760]   a question of behavior.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   You remember Matthew Arnold's famous definition of religion, don't you?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:30.360]   Matthew Arnold said that religion is nothing but morality tinged with emotion.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.000]   You see, he drew a distinction.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.560]   You can have a morality pure and simple and nothing but morality.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.080]   He says morality isn't religion.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.600]   There is an additional factor in religion, and that is it.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   He says religion is morality tinged with emotion.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.720]   There's a certain amount of feeling in it, it's still basically morality.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.840]   Ah yes, but the man who's a religious, he has a certain amount of immersion and feeling
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:05.440]   in connection with his morality, and that is their conception of religion.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.120]   And again, you see, you can hold that view of religion and God doesn't come in at all.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.680]   You can be a highly moral person and talk a lot about morality and write a lot about
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.360]   morality and not believe in God at all.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   He may never be in your thoughts.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.640]   The personal God never comes in.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.880]   There are many such men in the world, some of them are great men, and some of them have
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.220]   died quite recently and they've been praised and lauded.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.200]   They didn't believe in God.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.760]   They were highly moral and they were in a sense very good men.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.160]   Yes, but they were nothing but good pagans.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   Morality or morality tinged perhaps with emotion.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.400]   And then there are others for me to complete this list, and there are large numbers of
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:14:01.760]   these today, it seems to me, who think of it only in terms of some kind of an experience.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:08.640]   There are people who are miserable and unhappy for various reasons and they look for happiness,
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.200]   and they're told that it can be found somehow or another in religion.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.240]   They may have tried the cults and so on and not found it, and then they come to this,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.680]   as I read in a very striking and telling phrase quite recently, and oh, how true it is.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.560]   There are people whose religion consists of something like this.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:37.120]   God to them is some kind of a, well, I'll quote exactly, a kind of great pal, a great
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.960]   friend, who's always there and ready and at hand to help you and to comfort you and
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.160]   to do whatever you want.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.400]   Is it healing of the body?
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   All right.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   Is it guidance?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   All right.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   Is it to feel happy?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   All right.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Is it friendship?
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   God is depicted as this great friend, this great pal.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.200]   Quite simple, Sonia, and all so easy.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.880]   Well, you're familiar with all that kind of thing, and these other things that pass
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.840]   in the name of religion, which are nothing but forms of psychology and psychological
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.040]   treatment and things of that kind.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.280]   Well, the point I'm making is this.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   That's not the thing that this man had.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.320]   The essence, I say, the first thing about true religion is that it means a knowledge
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   of God.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.840]   Well, how have these things come in?
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.760]   Oh, I'll tell you how they've come in.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.920]   They've come in because the modern man always starts with himself.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.080]   He rarely is the center of his own universe.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.960]   He's only interested in himself and his own welfare and well-being and his own reactions.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.080]   So he starts with himself and he ends with himself.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.800]   Religion is something that helps me.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.360]   And I say to this man, how wrong that is that religion starts with God.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.400]   There, not here, not with me, but with God.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's objective before it's subjective.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:16.680]   But there, I think you'll agree, is the trouble with so many at the present time.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.320]   And that is why they are in trouble and in difficulties.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.680]   That is why they never seem to find that happiness that they're looking for, and that rest
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.400]   and that peace for their souls.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.160]   They start with an initial wrong conception.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.780]   If you really want to know this man's experience, if you want to be able to speak like this,
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.000]   if you want to be able to face life and death and everything in this mood and in this way,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.460]   well then I say there is only one hope, and the hope is this.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.000]   We start with him.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:00.680]   How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.480]   It's a knowledge of God.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.240]   Very well, what is this knowledge?
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.760]   Well let me hold before you this evening some of the things that this man tells us in these
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.840]   first three verses.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.800]   When I say true religion means a knowledge of God, and what do we know about him?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Well it's this.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.760]   He is the living God.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.560]   My soul longeth even fainteth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my flesh crieth
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:39.960]   out for the living God.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:49.840]   Not an idea, you see, not a thought, not a blessing machine, not a mere agency to which
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.800]   I can apply when I am in trouble, but the living God.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.000]   God is personal.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   Haven't we already expressed it in a hymn tonight?
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:15.240]   God of all being thrown afar, thy glory flames from sun and star, center and soul of every
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   sphere, God, the living God.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.840]   God is the source of all life, is the source of all being.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.240]   God is eternal, God is everlasting.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.440]   There is no beginning to God, there will be no end to God.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.480]   Oh, don't we all agree at this point that half our difficulties arise from the fact
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.560]   that we forget that God is the living God?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   Haven't we all done it?
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.600]   I've done it myself, alas, hundreds of times, not to say thousands.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.920]   I've been in an argument or a dispute about God and about religion, and I sat there with
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.160]   a pipe in my mouth or a cigarette and I expressed my views of God and others did, and we said
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.120]   this and that and criticized.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.960]   If we realized that he was the living God and looking down upon us, we'd have been on
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   our knees, prostrate on our faces, the living God.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.320]   You remember how the prophet Daniel put it to King Belshazzar?
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:35.880]   He said, "The God in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways, that is the
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.520]   one with whom you and I have to do."
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:49.440]   Have you ever stopped to consider, my dear friend, that God is the living God?
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.400]   Have you ever gone down on your knees and paused and meditated and said, "I am in the
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.360]   presence of God"?
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.200]   Have you thought of him in this personal way?
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.640]   Have you gone beyond all ideas and all teachings and realized that God is personal?
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.760]   He says, "I am that I am."
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:22.040]   God is the living God.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.440]   Oh, I say, what a difference it would make if we had started with this and realized it
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.760]   as we should.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.560]   God you see is not in our hands.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.520]   God is not someone that we can put in front of us and discuss him and look around him.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:48.800]   God is everywhere and we are beneath him and we are just looking up the living God.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.320]   But come, let's look at one of his other terms.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.280]   You notice the one he actually puts first is this, "How amiable are thy tabernacles,"
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.760]   he says, "O Lord of hosts."
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760]   What does he mean?
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.920]   Well, this is his way of describing the strength and the power and the majesty and the glory
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.240]   of God, the hosts of heaven.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.280]   Ah, yes, he is behind them and beyond them.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.520]   He orders them, he created them, he brought them into being.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:27.960]   He put the rules in them, he guides them, he can interrupt them, the Lord God of hosts.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:37.240]   The strength and the power and the majesty and the glory of God.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.080]   You see, isn't it here we all tend to go so wrong, we talk about religion and we say,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.920]   "I haven't found this or that," and then we begin to criticize.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.080]   Well, now if God is a God of love, why does he allow this and that?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   I'm constantly getting these questions put before me.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.000]   And here you are, you see, what's it all due to?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Well, the trouble is, you see, we don't realize he's the Lord of hosts.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.880]   He's above the flux of time.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.840]   He's outside the process and the changes of history.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.120]   We think this world is so big and so important, and it is, of course.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.520]   I don't want to detract from that, but my dear friends, when you think of God, this
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.320]   world is nothing.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.600]   He made it by a word.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.160]   He said, "Let there be," and there was light.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.520]   He's the Lord of hosts, and all I'm arguing for is this, that if you're in trouble about
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.800]   your religion and you don't know God, and you feel your prayers are not very effective
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.080]   and efficacious, I'm just asking you a question.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:50.800]   Is it, I wonder, because you've never realized who and what God is?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:58.680]   We are all so much like Moses on that famous occasion of the burning bush, aren't we?
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.360]   There he was, you see, minding his sheep one afternoon, and had gone to the back side of
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.720]   the mountain, and suddenly he sees a remarkable phenomenon.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.000]   A bush was burning, and yet it wasn't consumed.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.840]   And as a typical man, a modern man, he said, "I will turn aside, and I will investigate
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.400]   this strange phenomenon."
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   And a voice came out and said, "Stand back!
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:28.040]   Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground!"
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:37.640]   And you remember Isaiah had a similar kind of experience.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:43.920]   God gave him just a dim glimpse and revelation of himself, and the house was filled with
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:51.040]   smoke and the posts of the door began to shake, and the glory of God was revealed.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:58.520]   And Isaiah responded in the only right way when he said, "I am a man of unclean lips,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.040]   and I dwell amongst a people with unclean lips."
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.720]   If you want to be able to say, "O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.400]   in thee," this is the line, my friends.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.280]   Start by stopping, and then thinking, and then saying, "The living God, the Lord of
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:27.600]   hosts, the Lord of glory, my King, the King eternal, invisible, immortal, the only wise
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.480]   God that dwelleth in a light that is unapproachable, eternal light, eternal light, how pure the
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.600]   soul must be."
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.080]   That's the secret.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.920]   Now do you see, before you begin to argue about miracles, and before you trot out the
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.960]   old question about Cain's wife, and before you begin to argue about the person of Jesus
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:58.920]   Christ, I say, "Go back and start, God!"
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:06.280]   And then his other term which he uses, did you notice it?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:14.040]   He describes him and refers to him seven times as Jehovah.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.760]   It's translated here by the word "Lord."
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:23.880]   "How immovable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts."
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:32.600]   Seven times in the psalm he uses that word, the word Jehovah.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   And why?
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:42.040]   Well, this is one of the most important things of all for us.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:49.720]   God is, as I have been reminding you, the living God and the mighty God of hosts.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.600]   But if he had not revealed himself in this name, Jehovah, not one of us would ever have
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.080]   a hope of knowing him or of ever dwelling in his glorious presence.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   But God has revealed himself by this name of Jehovah.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.440]   If you want to read the history, go back to the book of Exodus and read the first six
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.120]   chapters, and there you'll find all about it.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.920]   "O Jehovah of hosts."
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   What's it mean?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:27.400]   It means this, that God has revealed his gracious purposes to mankind.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:36.200]   He has revealed himself in promises, in covenants, in pledging himself to do certain things for
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:42.280]   us and for our well-being.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.640]   He did it there, of course, on that occasion to which I've already referred, when he met
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.240]   with Moses at the burning bush.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:56.680]   There were the children of Israel down in Egypt in the bondage and in the captivity
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.800]   and in the hopelessness of it all.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.340]   They couldn't do anything.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.840]   They were hopelessly outnumbered by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians were cruel and harsh, and
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.600]   the poor children of Israel were pining away, and their situation is desperate and hopeless.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.800]   Ah, yes, but God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, and this is what he said, "I
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.280]   am come down.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.680]   I am going to deliver.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.000]   I am going to send you back and bring them out."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.320]   God, the deliverer, the merciful God.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:36.920]   The God of kindness and of compassion, the God of grace, the God of love.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:44.280]   The God who tells us that in spite of our sin, he has visited us in his Son to redeem
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   us.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:53.720]   Jehovah, the covenant God, the God of the promises, and he'll never break them.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:01.840]   Now there are the names that the psalmist uses with respect to God, and the principle
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.880]   that I am therefore laying down this evening is just this.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:18.280]   True religion consists in knowing God, in knowing that God, in knowing God as he is,
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.240]   the God that I have described to you in the terms that are used by the psalmist.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.360]   The God that has so graciously revealed himself to us in these ways.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.920]   But now having said that, I've got to go another step forward because the psalmist
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.280]   goes a second step, and the second is this.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.560]   True religion not only consists in a knowledge of God, it consists in a personal knowledge
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   of God.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   Do you notice how he puts it in the third verse?
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:29:02.040]   "And thine altars, O Lord Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God."
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:10.760]   In other words, the psalmist is not talking here about some theoretical knowledge only.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:21.520]   He is concerned about and interested in a personal relationship, and this is something
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.600]   that I cannot emphasize over much.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:33.040]   You can have a theoretical, abstract, intellectual knowledge of God, but it isn't religion.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:41.320]   Here is a man, I say, who is resting in the knowledge, who is rejoicing in it, who is
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.160]   calm and collected and happy.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.440]   He says that this is so real that, as I've reminded you, a day in the courts of God is
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.480]   better to him than a thousand, and he had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.000]   than to dwell in the very tents of wickedness.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Why?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.800]   Because, "My King and my God," this great eternal God is his God.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   He knows him.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.880]   He is related to him.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.000]   And this is of the very essence of the whole position.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:28.640]   "I am his and he is mine forever and forever."
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.440]   Do you know God personally?
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:46.360]   Are you able to say, "My King, my God, my God, how wonderful thou art, thy majesty,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.920]   how bright."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   Are you, I say, able to say that, that he is real to you, that he is personal to you,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:09.720]   that God is your God, that you belong to him and in this great and mysterious manner he
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.800]   belongs to you?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.040]   Now I don't stay with that this evening.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.760]   All I'm asking is this.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:25.920]   Had you realized that that is true and real religion, had you attained unto it, had you
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:32.680]   arrived at it, I'm certain that at this moment you are anxious for me to make my next statement
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.880]   or to ask my next question, if you like, which is this.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.280]   How is this knowledge to be obtained?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:50.160]   How can I know God and how can I know him as the living God, as the true God, as the
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.640]   King, as this glorious God of hosts?
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:59.040]   How can I know that God is my God and will never leave me nor forsake me?
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.720]   How can I get into the position of this man or David in the 23rd Psalm, "The Lord is
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.480]   my shepherd, I shall not want, even though I go through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.360]   I have no fear, I fear no evil."
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   Why?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.840]   "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.040]   Now then, how can we get there?
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.120]   That is the question.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.760]   Wouldn't you like to be able to pray as this man prayed and to go to God and to say, "Oh
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.200]   God of hosts, hear my prayer, blessed is the man whose strength is in thee."
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.440]   Wouldn't you like to have that?
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.640]   How can you know him?
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.880]   He gives the answer.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:53.680]   There is only one way whereby we can ever come to this position and to this knowledge.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:03.200]   "Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.960]   may lay her young."
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.040]   Where is it?
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   "Even thine altars, my King and my God."
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.120]   What does he mean by this?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, here I say is the secret of it all.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.320]   How did this man find God?
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.520]   How did he get to know him?
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.000]   What is the secret of this peace and joy that he is enjoying?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.680]   He answers by saying that the secret is the altars.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.120]   Did you notice the plural?
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:51.800]   He doesn't say, "Even thine altar," but "Even thine altars," the plural, more than one.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   What does he mean?
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:02.280]   Well, you see, he is going back again to the imagery of the tabernacle and the temple.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.600]   Do you remember it?
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:12.480]   You approach the temple and there is the opening, and there is this outer court, and there it
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:19.200]   leads into the holy place, and that leads into the holiest of all, where God is in the
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.080]   Shekinah presence.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.440]   God is there in the holiest of all.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.560]   How can I get to him?
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.000]   There is only one answer.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.280]   I have got to pass two altars.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:37.680]   Even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.640]   And what were these two altars?
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:52.000]   Well, the first, and the order is vital, is what was called the altar of sacrifice.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.600]   The altar to which they took the animals when they had killed them, and placed their bodies
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.080]   upon the altar and burnt the body.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.880]   The altar of sacrifice.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   What is this?
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.440]   Well, God had given them the commandment and had taught them the way.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.800]   He had said that there was no approach into his presence except they brought blood.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.960]   There is no remission of sins without shedding of blood.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:22.080]   So they took animals and they smoked them, they slew them, and they took the blood, they
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.720]   burnt the bodies, and then they went in with the blood.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.400]   The high priest.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.960]   The altar of sacrifice.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:41.120]   And then there was another altar, which was called the altar of incense.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.360]   What does that mean?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:48.960]   Well, there was an altar on which they always burnt this incense, and that is typifying
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.680]   prayer.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.840]   You first of all have to sacrifice, then you go with the blood, but even then you need
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:03.760]   the incense, and then you go into the presence of God.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:13.440]   On thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.400]   What does it all mean, says someone?
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.640]   You are talking about an Old Testament psalmist.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.520]   What has all this to do with me?
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.200]   My dear friend, it still applies, it is still true.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.920]   What the man is saying, you see, is this.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:39.880]   The moment a man realizes the being and the nature and the character of God, he realizes
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.760]   his own sinfulness.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:51.960]   The living God, the author of life and of all being, that holy God that is beyond description,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:37:00.600]   there in heaven with all his power, and I, small, minute, sinful, vile, unworthy, how
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:07.360]   can I approach him?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.400]   And God has given the answer.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.800]   I cannot approach him as I am.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.920]   I am too sinful, I am too vile.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.640]   My sins must be taken away.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.320]   And he taught the people under the Old Testament to put them on the animal.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.440]   They laid their hands upon the animal.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.800]   They transferred their sins, and the animal was sacrificed and placed upon the altar,
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.160]   and God is satisfied.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.600]   The altar?
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.640]   And that is still the only way to go to God.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.120]   If you but realize the nature and the being of God and your own sinfulness, you would
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.520]   never dare to pray to him as you are.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.840]   You would never rush into his presence.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.160]   You would say, "God is in heaven and I am on earth, and he is mighty and I am small,
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.960]   and I am in his hands, and he can do as he pleases with me, and I am vile and rotten,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:10.560]   how can I approach him?"
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.880]   And there is only one answer to the question.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.120]   We have an altar.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.760]   There is a sacrifice.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:31.120]   God sent his own Son into this world, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and he made his soul a
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   sacrifice for our sins.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.120]   He placed himself upon the altar, and God placed our sins upon him.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.560]   That is the meaning of the bread and the wine.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:50.480]   This is representation of the altar, the altar on Calvary's hill, the Lamb that was slain.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.040]   Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.320]   The altar is still essential.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:05.520]   I cannot know this God except I go through Christ.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:14.280]   And then that second altar, the altar of the incense.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:22.680]   How can I go into the presence of God in my weakness and my sin and with all my troubles
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.520]   and my problems?
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:30.160]   Well the author of the epistle to the Hebrews answers your questions in these words.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:43.320]   "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.120]   grace to help in time of need."
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.680]   "Therefore," he says, what does he mean by the "therefore"?
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.360]   What he has just been saying.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.640]   He says, "We have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.360]   of God, a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, because
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.080]   he was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet without sin."
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.480]   How can I go to God?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.800]   Here is the answer, the blood of sacrifice, the death of Christ, the blood of Christ,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   the atonement for my sins, and then Christ the high priest that has entered into the
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:31.320]   presence of God and is there at this moment.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:38.920]   And as I pray to God, he pours the incense of his own blessed person upon my prayers
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:46.400]   and they go to God, pleasing and acceptable with the holy aroma of the Son of God upon
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.360]   them, even thine altars.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:41:05.440]   O Lord of hosts, my King and my God, have you found it difficult to pray?
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.400]   Have you felt when you have gone on your knees that you are talking to yourself that you
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.160]   do not know God?
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.840]   My dear friend, this is why you have not been via the altars.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.720]   The altars are essential.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.440]   There is no knowledge of God except in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.960]   There is no other way into his presence.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.320]   You do not understand, I know.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.960]   I do not understand, I believe it.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.680]   God has appointed the altar.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:43.520]   Praying therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:53.360]   O, says the psalmist, it is even thine altars, O God of hosts, that gives me everything,
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:00.040]   the sacrifice, the incense, and we have it all in the person of the Son of God who loved
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.320]   us and gave himself for us.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.240]   His body was broken, his blood was shed.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.680]   That is why we do this.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.720]   We declare his death.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.840]   It is his death that gives us life.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:17.640]   It is in and through him, the living way, that we enter into the presence of God.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:29.320]   Knowing that in Christ and him crucified, God has forgiven all our sins and has reconciled
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:37.480]   us unto himself and is ever ready and willing to receive us graciously.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:46.440]   My beloved people, have you visited the altars?
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.920]   Have you found rest at the altar?
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.360]   Do the bread and the wine speak peace to you?
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.920]   As you take them, do you thank God, as this man thanked him, for pardon and forgiveness,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:04.640]   for life, for sustenance, for power, for all you need in time and in eternity?
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:16.960]   The altar, the altar of sacrifice, the altar of the incense, it is the only way to know
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.440]   God.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:27.520]   This knowledge of God is alone found at the altars.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:38.280]   And lastly, you notice that when a man has thus found God and has come to know him, nothing
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.320]   else matters to him.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.720]   You notice that it takes up the whole man.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.260]   My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.200]   My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:04.240]   My soul, my heart, my flesh, my whole man, bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.640]   within me, bless his holy name.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.160]   That is what he is saying.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.920]   Are you saying it?
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.720]   This is true religion?
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:32.120]   When we have it, when we know God, this God as our God, he is everything to us, and there
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:40.920]   is nothing else that is worth bothering about, if you have caught but a glimpse of him, well,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:49.720]   then I say the desire of your whole being will be to know him.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:59.320]   As the heart panteth after the water brooks on a day like this, as a hungry, weary, thirsty
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:09.640]   traveler in the desert looks for a spring or for a well, so panteth, fainteth.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:17.520]   My heart after thee, the living God.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.320]   My dear friends, this is the question.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.720]   Do you know him?
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.880]   Have you found him?
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   Are you resting in him and rejoicing in him?
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:41.560]   When you say, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in him," are you blessed?
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.120]   Would you like to be?
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.200]   Would you like to know him?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:51.440]   I say again, there is only one thing to do.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.800]   Come to the altars.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:08.920]   Jesus Christ, a sacrifice for sins, Jesus Christ, the high priest, seated at the right
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:20.280]   hand of God, who knows all about us, who has been in this world, has been weary and faint,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:29.880]   sorrowful and sad, has experienced treachery and shame, persecution, and all the ills of
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.960]   the world.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:42.760]   He knows all about you, and he is with God, seated at his right hand.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.600]   Visit the altars.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.800]   Rest at the altars.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:47:00.160]   And then I can assure you, you will be able to say with this man, "My King."
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.400]   Yes, my God.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:16.640]   Though he is so great and glorious, and I am so small and sinful, he is my God.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.040]   Amen.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.960]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
