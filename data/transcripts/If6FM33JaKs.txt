[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hi, I'm here with Pastor Mark. Mark, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Yes, I'm Mark Escalera. I'm the lead pastor/teacher at Yellowstone Baptist Church located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, about two hours north of Denver, Colorado.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   All right. Mark, you've been reading through the LSB. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Yes. I actually love the inclusion of the name of God in the Old Testament, Yahweh, and it just reads so differently.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I especially love the Psalms. It's one of my favorite books, and it's certainly something that we have been making some transitions.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I've encouraged others to be able to read the LSB as well. My son, they have the LSB already, so I'm very thankful for the new translation.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   All right. Thanks for being with us.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Thank you.
