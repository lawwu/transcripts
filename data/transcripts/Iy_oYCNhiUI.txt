[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   This is a game of chess played by two AI engines each far better at chess than any human on earth.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.080]   The question I had is what happens when you let these machines battle it out
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   on an infinite chessboard with infinite pieces.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.480]   Each move calculated and performed on an 8x8 subset that in isolation is a totally legal
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   position with two kings but in the big picture is just a tiny subset of a much bigger game.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.160]   Where each checkmate destroys the king and the deserted pieces move on in search of another
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.800]   neighboring victim. Pieces get captured and sacrificed in other words the usual game of chess
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.440]   but on a much bigger board. The play is extended arbitrarily outwards but here we focus on just
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   this subset of about 6,000 squares. On the bottom is the counter showing the number of kings and
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.440]   checkmate victories. Let me mention some details. The boards are initialized with the middle game
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.600]   position for one of 30,000 famous grandmaster games including Magnus Carlsen, Bobby Fischer,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   Gasparo, Spassky, Tal, Karpov and so on. The selection of which 8x8 subset to use for computing
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.400]   the next move is made randomly among all the boards that have legal chess positions. Optimizing
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   the selection process is something that could be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.240]   and would make this meta game of infinite chess very interesting. In fact there are fascinating
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   questions here about the generalizability of AI engines far beyond the scale and the constraints
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.400]   of the game they were trained on. Chess is just a game but when you start to remove the constraints
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.520]   and increase the scale it becomes something else. Something more like the game of life
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:09.440]   played on an infinite chess board.
