[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.460]   And today I have a special guest with me, Sydney, my wife, to talk about an interesting
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.180]   topic I think, and that's the importance of feeling consistently uncomfortable for financial
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.600]   freedom, personal growth, and personal development.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   So say hi.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   Hello, guys.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.000]   And welcome to this episode of the Financial Samurai podcast where we have not been recording
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.600]   a lot lately because we've been too busy trying to enjoy life a little bit more.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.860]   So I don't know if you guys have noticed or have kept up with the news, but the state
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880]   of Virginia is kind of blowing up.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   Racism and sexual assault allegations have befallen the governor of Virginia, the attorney
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.720]   general of Virginia, and the lieutenant governor of Virginia.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   And all this stuff just basically reminded me of all the racial and racist altercations
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.120]   I experienced growing up in Virginia for public high school and public university in the mid
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.560]   to late '90s.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   Given all that's happened in Virginia on the most senior level of government, you know
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   racism in Virginia wasn't unusual decades ago when I was going to school.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960]   It wasn't a constant ubiquity, but I did experience some type of racist encounter about every
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840]   tenth time I went out of the house.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.880]   For example, here's a milder example.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   I remember I was waiting in line to go to the bathroom at a gas station off I-95 heading
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   south.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.160]   I was about to head down to the College of William & Mary.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.680]   And a white guy behind me said, "Hey, don't you understand English?
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   What are you waiting for?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680]   The bathroom is open."
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.400]   And I was like, "What?
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   What the hell?"
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.560]   So I turned around and I said, "Look, there's actually someone in there.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.040]   They just didn't lock the door.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   Do you understand the English that's coming out of my mouth?"
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   And he was taken aback.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   He said, "Oh, okay, never mind."
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.020]   But I was ready to kick his ass and rumble.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.880]   So the amazing thing about all these racial experiences is that it's all I ever knew
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.480]   since coming to America for high school.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.560]   Before that I was living in Asia for 13 years in Zambia.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520]   And yeah, there was like racism there and all that.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.760]   But what I knew about America is just kind of what I knew.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.560]   I came for ninth grade and I just thought it was pretty normal to be on the receiving
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.960]   end of racial slurs or racial innuendos every so often, right?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.320]   So I just endured and fought back as hard as I could each time.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.840]   And yes, I got suspended a couple of times for fighting but it was worth it to defend
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   my honor.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.800]   Like all these altercations really I think built my character and my fierceness to what
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   I am today.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.320]   So kids stopped messing around with me once they felt my fist of fury.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.800]   And after I got a job in 1999 in New York City and again when I moved to San Francisco
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   in 2001, I realized that being a minority in America felt so much more comfortable in
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.240]   a diverse city.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.800]   So my racial conflicts dropped from every 10th time I went outside in Manhattan to maybe
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.200]   every 25th time, right?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   And then in San Francisco, we've been here since 2001 and I can't remember my last racial
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.160]   conflict because we're a minority majority city.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.360]   Do you experience any racism in San Francisco?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   In San Francisco?
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   No, I don't remember.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.840]   I don't have any situation.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.680]   So that's great and it's kind of like, "Oh, OK.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.760]   Actually America is not like exactly how I experienced when I was growing up in Northern
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.440]   Virginia and then in Williamsburg for college."
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.480]   And so as always, I think it's important to look at the positive side of things.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.920]   And the positive side of racism I think is that it gave me extra strength I needed to
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.600]   endure those long work hours in banking for so many years, right?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.400]   You remember when I first started banking in New York City, you were like my alarm clock.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Yeah, you helped me try to wake up by 5 AM because the earliest I ever woke up before
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   was like 7.30 to go to 8 AM class which I actually dropped.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   And I think racism gave me tremendous motivation to prove that I could succeed in America.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   And look, it's harder in the workplace when so few management people look like you or
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.040]   want to mentor you.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.640]   But I was always telling myself, "You know what?
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   Screw that.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   I'm going to blaze my own trail.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   I'm going to work extra hard.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   I'm going to be more energetic and entrepreneurial."
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.000]   So when I got promoted to VP at 27, it was one of the greatest feelings ever.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.640]   It was like, "Ah, finally I got some power because nobody is going to mess with me now
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.200]   because in order to get promoted, you need to have a consensus driven committee to say,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.760]   "Little Johnny or Little Jane or – not little, just like John or Jane.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.600]   We give him or her our blessing."
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.040]   If you don't have a consensus on the committee, you're not getting promoted.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840]   And obviously, everyone wants to get promoted because it looks good and you get paid more,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   right?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.320]   So all my contemporary colleagues were still associates, one level down and would stay
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.460]   associates usually until the age of 30 to 32.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.340]   So despite being gone from the workforce since 2012, I still have the energy and motivation
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.020]   as I did when I was a teenager.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.580]   I think you recognize that, right?
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.580]   For sure.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580]   For sure.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.580]   OK.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.100]   And I think it's like Iron Man's arc reactor if you ever watch Marvel comics and movies.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.940]   It's like pulsating in my chest.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.380]   It's driving me to keep going no matter what thanks to all the hate I experienced
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.740]   growing up.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.620]   And to be honest, it feels amazing to have all this energy.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.740]   You know, like I don't know.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.660]   You see the bad guy, he put his hand in the energy something, something and he's like,
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.980]   "Oh, I feel so much more powerful now."
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.980]   I don't know.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.340]   I just feel – I feel so blessed to have this energy and this has enabled both my wife
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.580]   and me to leave work behind at age 34.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.400]   And it is this confidence that has fortified me to take bigger risks in my career, in my
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.700]   investments and in our online business.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.780]   And I think without this energy, I definitely wouldn't be able to regularly wake up by
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.460]   5 AM, sometimes 4 AM for the past two years since the birth of our son to work on Financial
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:16.460]   Samurai, grow the traffic, grow the business and then basically try to be as good a father
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.900]   as possible for the rest of the day.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   Now obviously, my wife has been critical and is the main caretaker for our son.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.780]   But I don't think with all these things that happened to me when I was growing up,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.060]   I would have been able to do this.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.060]   I mean after you become financially independent and you leave work, what's the point of
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.780]   grinding so hard and so much?
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.220]   I think you are motivated by things that you love and I know that writing is something
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.300]   that you truly love having seen you do it for so long and every time you finish writing
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.780]   a post or a newsletter, you're so excited and it's so fun to witness that and to see
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.540]   how great writing is as an outlet for you.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.780]   So I think that in itself does give you a lot of energy.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.300]   Yeah, I mean I guess it's cool to come up with an idea, to write it out, edit it and
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   press publish.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.660]   It feels like a great sense of accomplishment.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:25.420]   So I think bottom line is hardship makes us better appreciate the good times, right?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.820]   So I think instead of moving to Honolulu, Hawaii, you know it sounds great and all that.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.420]   Why don't we just move to Virginia instead?
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.020]   I mean think about it, given how much racism and bullying has given me, I mean it's been
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.740]   so special.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.580]   I think it's best for us to move back to Virginia and rejoin a 5.5% minority.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.860]   You know to survive in a less comfortable situation forces us to adapt.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.500]   Learning things like self-defense, conflict resolution, self-deprecation and humor are
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.060]   all useful skills to learn and have in our adult lives.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.980]   What wonderful skills to teach our son.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.820]   Hawaii is obviously a wonderful, wonderful place but I think there's a chance it might
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.260]   be too comfortable there.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.220]   I think if you can survive in Hawaii, you can survive anywhere.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   And why do I say that?
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:27.220]   It's because if it's sunshine, 78 degrees, sunny, are you going to stay inside and study
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.180]   for three hours and work on your self-defense skills and communication skills and your math
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.580]   and all that stuff?
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.140]   Or are you going to have the temptation to just get out of the house and play?
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.500]   I would think most people would just kick back, right?
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.460]   I think that's possible.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.860]   The other way to look at it though is if you grow up in Hawaii, it's your home.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.620]   It's what you're used to.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:00.140]   So it's not maybe the urge to go outside every single day isn't necessarily as high because
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.940]   that's what you're accustomed to.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.940]   And we have relatives, younger relatives who have grown up in Hawaii and they've done very
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.940]   well in school.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:15.720]   They've gotten straight A's and are doing well in their collegiate life.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.380]   So I think it's totally possible to grow up in an environment like Hawaii and still do
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.380]   very well.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.380]   OK.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.380]   I mean fair enough.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.820]   But I think Virginia, what an amazing state.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.540]   Strong economy, good people, southern charm and comfort.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:37.900]   I think people are products of their time and I don't blame a minority of Virginians
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.940]   for thinking the racist things that they do about minorities.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:48.900]   It's just the way – if your dad and mom were kind of racist, you kind of like learn
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.900]   from them.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.260]   And the history of Virginia, the Confederate capital, Jamestown and all that, is part of
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.740]   the culture and I think as times change, people will change.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.260]   So I think in general I look back upon my eight years there with fondness.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.560]   The good definitely outweighed the bad and Virginia was my rite of passage into adulthood.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.780]   It's just these recent racial incidents that involved a political lead that have really
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.740]   triggered a lot of forgotten memories.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.260]   And there are a lot of benefits of Virginia, right?
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.140]   So one, even if we go to northern Virginia, which is the most expensive part of Virginia,
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.660]   it's still 50 percent cheaper in terms of housing than San Francisco.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.940]   Meanwhile, there's plenty of solid public schools, right?
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.460]   There's a lot of wealth around the D.C. area.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.060]   Also parents, your mom is in Virginia.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.620]   Your sister is in North Carolina.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.500]   My sister is in New York.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.340]   So we're much closer to family and that's a great thing.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:52.180]   Further, by shunning a diverse environment like San Francisco or Honolulu for a more
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:58.340]   homogenous environment, our son will have a chance to experience more racial discrimination
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.300]   than if he were, you know, here, right?
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.900]   So with each difficult encounter, his mother and I will mentor him by teaching him about
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:12.380]   hate and ignorance and perhaps with each encounter, our boy will develop also a chip on his shoulder
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.620]   to motivate himself to get ahead and prove his haters wrong.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.180]   I think that's a really wonderful, wonderful attribute to have.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   And I fear that if we shelter our son and our children too much, they'll grow up to
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:31.180]   be ignorant, unmotivated individuals who will whine at the slightest of inconveniences.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.940]   So I think I've made my case for going to Virginia.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.580]   And you know what?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.740]   Uncomfortable situations.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.020]   Uncomfortable situations make us grow up, right?
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.220]   You know, I've got many examples.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.820]   I'll just give a couple, right?
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.860]   Having to get in the office at 5.30 a.m., you know, that was brutal.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   But you know what?
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.140]   After 10 years, I no longer have an alarm clock because I naturally get up by 5 a.m.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.220]   and I just get to work.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.020]   I just grind it out and therefore we have a pretty decent lifestyle.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.140]   Being the new kid in school every two to four years, that was hard.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.900]   But it forces me to be, you know, to introduce myself to new people, to get to know people,
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.740]   you know, just get out of my shell and get out of my comfort zone.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.620]   So I think, you know, at the end of the day, going to Virginia is a pretty obvious move.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.260]   But you know, important geo-arbitrage moves need a consensus, right?
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.060]   Unless, you know, we want a divorce.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.220]   So let's see what my wife has to say.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.740]   She spent 20 years growing up in Charlottesville, Richmond, and Williamsburg, Virginia.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.320]   So she's even more of an expert on Virginia than me.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.820]   We agree on a lot of things.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.460]   This is not one of them.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:50.820]   I have a very different view on going to Virginia and I've actually been quite stressed out
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.700]   since Sam came up with this, let's call it an idea.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.720]   Because I enjoyed my time in Virginia to, you know, to some extent, but I knew I wanted
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.260]   to get out of there as soon as I graduated.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.260]   And that's what I did.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.780]   I booked a one-way ticket to California and never looked back.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.540]   I've been there, I've done that.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.980]   I just, I don't miss the lifestyle there at all.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:22.220]   And I, you know, firmly agree with you that racism is terrible and that it does exist
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.660]   more in less diverse places.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.660]   But you know what?
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.340]   It's everywhere.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:34.300]   Even if we stay in San Francisco, move to Hawaii, there could be issues of racism that
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.980]   pop up.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:43.180]   And I think intentionally exposing our son to unnecessary negativity and hatred just
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.540]   doesn't feel right to me.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.040]   I don't think that's good for him.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.980]   And I think there's ways to teach him how to respect people of all sorts through other
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:59.380]   means, whether it's travel, which we want to do as he gets older, reading, volunteering,
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.340]   and having all kinds of open discussions wherever we live.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:10.500]   And also, I don't think he needs to experience hardships like that on a regular basis in
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.700]   order to be a driven, hardworking individual.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:20.640]   I experienced racism growing up in Virginia, but that wasn't a motivator for me.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.780]   If anything, it made me want to get away.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.780]   I hear you.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.780]   It's tough.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.020]   You know, it's kind of fight or flight.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.020]   And I've always had the let's fight mentality because, hey, if you beat me up, at least
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.580]   I'm going to get one good blow, and that's going to feel very, very satisfying.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.300]   I guess you've never had that kind of let's fight attitude.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   Right.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.940]   I'm the exact opposite.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.860]   I want to get away.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.020]   You don't want to waste your time, you know, like spending energy on these losers, right?
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020]   And that's fair.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.500]   But it's not like we're going to go to Virginia and go to the racist den.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.180]   You know, Virginia is a great state, like I said.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:05.480]   It's just, you know, the experience of racism will happen more often than in Honolulu or
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.740]   in San Francisco because we'd be a 5.5 percent minority.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.580]   It's not like every day he walks out, you know, someone's going to be racist to him.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.180]   It's just, you know, once every while, maybe every 10 percent or 5 percent of the time.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.180]   So just that we have more teachable moments and more exposure to the real world.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.260]   Perhaps.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.820]   I think there's other things that we need to bring up, though, in terms of choosing
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.020]   to live in Virginia.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.660]   Having been there, I do not miss the weather.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.460]   I know there are people who love the four seasons and love that, but it's not something
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   I like.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.900]   I don't like humid summers and freezing winters.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.340]   I don't miss that.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.700]   I like the weather in San Francisco and Hawaii so much more.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:56.260]   I think us as a family, we will be so much happier here in San Francisco and Hawaii.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.620]   Sam, you love to be outdoors.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.380]   Our son loves to be outdoors and go on walks.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:07.940]   And I think, sure, you can do plenty of that in Virginia, but there's the whole winter
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.980]   and I just think we'll be happier as a family in Hawaii.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.820]   Don't you think you'd appreciate the six months that, you know, Virginia has great weather
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.180]   when you go through horrible, horrible weather?
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.380]   Yeah, but I've already experienced horrible weather for 20-some years.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.260]   I don't need to do it again.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:35.380]   I mean, I wrote a post about the West Coast and East Coast comparing and I was attacked
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.780]   for saying, you know, the weather is not as good on the East Coast.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.420]   So clearly with millions and tens of millions of people living on the East Coast, it must
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.620]   be decent weather because everybody's rational.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.980]   Why would they suffer through terrible weather?
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.820]   There are people who love the East Coast and that's wonderful.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.620]   That's where they want to live and that's good for them.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.900]   For us, we've always kind of been away from family and if we go to Hawaii, we're with
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   your family.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.220]   Yeah, but I don't want to be selfish and just be next to my family.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.420]   Then we'll be so far away from your family on the East Coast.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.460]   It's not something you should feel selfish about because it's a decision we're making
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:23.740]   as a family and I know that we would be much happier in Hawaii and I just can't move back
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.740]   to Virginia.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.740]   I can't do it.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.740]   I can't do it, Sam.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   I can't do it.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.740]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.100]   Well, we want to hear from you guys because we really do have a big decision to make.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.660]   You know, would you move to warm and sunny Honolulu where life is even more comfortable
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.060]   than it is in San Francisco?
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.220]   You know, the majority of the Honolulu population will look like our boy, either Asian or multiracial
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.900]   and the Aloha spirit is amazing in Hawaii.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.180]   He'll grow up in an environment that is much more chill because most people in Hawaii are
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.820]   working to live, not living to work.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.540]   Or would you move to somewhere in Virginia where, you know, the weather is not great
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.700]   for six months of the year but it'll make you appreciate the other half of the year
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.900]   more.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:13.380]   Our boy will feel, you know, the discomfort of being a minority and as a result, he'll
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.740]   better learn how to deal with difficult situations like racism and bullying.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   And you know what?
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.540]   Racism again and bullying will occur everywhere in the country.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.900]   I just think it might occur a little bit more in Virginia which could really build some
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:35.260]   of his confidence and character and give him a quicker taste of how cruel the world is,
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.260]   right?
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.140]   You know, everything is so sheltered in middle school, high school, college.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.020]   It's like such a joke how sheltered life is.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.780]   You know, our neighbors, we have three immediate neighbors.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:55.340]   Their house are nice and they all have adult sons, 27 to 30, maybe one or two years old,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.180]   still living at home with their parents.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.660]   Like to me, that is like a travesty.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:07.940]   It's a travesty that these parents have provided such an easy and good life for their kids
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:16.380]   that their sons are not motivated to become independent men and establish a family, a
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:27.700]   home, buy their own cars and feel the amazing glory of being independent launched individuals.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:36.340]   I agree with that in terms of it's sad that they haven't launched.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.900]   However, we don't know what they were like as parents.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.260]   We don't know what their upbringing was like.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.220]   I do because I talked to them.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.180]   I talked to the parents.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.660]   Our immediate neighbor, you know, they have a $2.5 million house, his parents.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:58.140]   So like they bought a 13-unit building and he sold it recently for like, I don't know,
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.140]   13-unit building.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.020]   Let's say it's $500,000 per unit, which is really cheap.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.820]   That's like $6.5 million.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.380]   So you're the grandson.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.420]   Hey, I got a $2.5 million house.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.220]   My grandparents are $6.5 million.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.100]   Why bother doing anything?
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   And you know, like, I don't know.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.100]   It just seems so sad.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.380]   It is sad.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.820]   I don't know what to say.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:27.300]   I think you and I as parents are going to be totally different from these people.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.180]   We don't -- I don't know.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.180]   I don't know.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.700]   I think we are going to be those parents who want to give our son everything and we're
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.660]   going to shelter him and we're going to protect him.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.380]   And I feel like we're going to go overboard and then he's going to be like, "Well, mommy,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   daddy, the world is not like how I grew up and can you help me and can I live in one
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.220]   of your houses?"
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.500]   And I'm like, "No, son.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   Be a man.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   Do the right thing."
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.340]   I think we should give our son more credit.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:05.260]   Even though he's still very young, he definitely shows signs that he is a very determined boy.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.220]   He is going to be focused like you.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.700]   I can see that clear as day.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.500]   He has that side of your personality.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.780]   And he's going to have struggles no matter where we live and what we give to him.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.260]   He's going to experience struggles and we're going to help him get through that and we're
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.740]   going to do things like travel to show him other ways.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.820]   All right.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.380]   So I think in conclusion, I want to end this podcast by saying what a blessing it is to
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.900]   grow up as a minority in America.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.940]   We have different challenges.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:45.140]   But man, we are given this opportunity and this fire to do something great.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.660]   If all I experienced was love and acceptance, I'd probably still be working at my soul-sucking
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.340]   job wondering what else is there to do.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.380]   What else is there in life?
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.780]   There would definitely be no financial samurai.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.180]   There would definitely be no early retirement.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.920]   There would definitely be no opportunity for both of us to be stay-at-home parents.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:14.860]   And I just want to highlight and just reiterate the importance of being consistently uncomfortable.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:20.300]   If you think about our country, we have a health epidemic.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.660]   Something like 60 plus percent of Americans are overweight and our health care costs are
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.740]   out of control.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.180]   We're subsidizing broken systems and people who are unhealthy, for example.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.620]   And why is it?
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.300]   Why is it that we have such a health problem in the United States?
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.640]   And I think the reason is because life is too easy.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.660]   Life is too abundant and comfortable in America.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.140]   If you go to Asia or like a third world country, you don't have this epidemic health crisis.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.100]   Diet has a lot to do with it, too, but we won't get into all that.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.300]   No, I'm just using this as an example.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.780]   OK, why did I start Financial Samurai?
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:07.500]   I started Financial Samurai because the world was ending in 2009 and I was scared.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.980]   And I had been thinking about starting Financial Samurai since 2006, but it was too easy.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.540]   2006, good bonus, good stock market.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.340]   2007, record bonus, record stock market.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.660]   2008, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.940]   And then in 2009, oh my gosh, I just lost 35 to 40 percent of my net worth in like six
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.940]   to 10 months.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.460]   That took 10 years building.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.460]   I need to do something.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.380]   I am so uncomfortable.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:37.140]   I need to get off my ass and start something so we have a contingency plan so I can do
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.740]   something new.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.940]   And for you, I think something uncomfortable was you didn't get promoted that one year
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.140]   at work.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.460]   And you finally said, you know what?
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460]   Screw this.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:53.620]   I'm going to get promoted and I'm going to leave with a severance, right?
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.140]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.140]   You were motivated.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:02.180]   If it happened to me repeatedly, I probably would have maybe lost all my confidence.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.700]   No, you would have quit and found another job.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.700]   I said, screw you.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.420]   I mean, I think we're very lucky how everything has worked out.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.740]   Yeah, we're lucky.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.900]   We're super lucky.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.280]   And I think a lot of stuff is due to luck and that's why we should never take our luck
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   for granted.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.540]   And that's why we should continue to grind because one day our luck will run out.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.980]   I always think to myself like, how did we get this lucky?
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:31.780]   Yeah, I also think work while we are still healthy because, man, when we've been hit
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.380]   with the flu or whatever or I had surgery a couple of years ago, it's like when you
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.940]   go through some health difficulty, man, it just puts everything into perspective.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.940]   Right.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.460]   I mean, I was sick for three to four weeks at the beginning of this year and February
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.140]   comes, I'm finally okay.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.380]   And I'm like, you know what?
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.380]   Let's get it on.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.380]   I'm going to publish three times a week.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.980]   I'm going to publish a newsletter every single week.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.020]   I'm going to produce while I'm still healthy because who knows how long that health will
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.020]   last.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.420]   So I think in conclusion, we're going to go to Virginia.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   Virginia, Virginia, Virginia.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:08.020]   Clearly, there's a great opportunity for us.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.780]   Save on housing, experience the real world.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.900]   And thank you, everybody.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.180]   Please pitch in and vote.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.980]   Click on the post and vote Virginia or Hawaii.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   Hawaii, here we come.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980]   All right.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:18.980]   Thanks, folks.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.820]   Thanks, folks.
