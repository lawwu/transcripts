[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Kayla writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, my soul is in great distress.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   After living in disobedience and under conviction for a few months,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   my deep desire I once had for fellowship with God is now gone.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I used to be so in love with Christ.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Hebrews 4 makes clear that sin hardens the heart, and I found it to be true.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   My question is, does this mean I have fallen away from the faith?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   My biggest fear is being destined for destruction, as Scripture says of Judas and others.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Please help."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Kayla?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I'm really thankful that Kayla is in distress.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I'm thankful that she's fearful because how much worse would it be if Kayla were careless right now,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   if she were cavalier, if she were just blowing off this coldness and saying,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   "Devil, my care, I don't give a rip how I feel. It doesn't matter anymore.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I tried that Christianity stuff. I'm done with it."
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That would be infinitely worse than fear and distress.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   The text that gives her fear but also gives hope is Hebrews 12 about Esau.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   "See to it," this is chapter 12, verse 15 from Hebrews,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And maybe that's what she's done is fallen into a season of sexual sin.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I mean, those are the kinds of things that make us feel hopeless about our possible salvation.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   "Don't be like Esau who sold his birthright for a single meal,"
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   just threw away his spiritual privileges for an immediate gratification.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   "For you know that afterwards when he desired to inherit a blessing, he was rejected.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   For he found no place," that's the literal translation,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   "no place to repent, no occasion to repent, no repentance, though he sought it with tears."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's possible to backslide so long and so deeply that there's no return.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Now, is that what's happened with you?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It doesn't sound like it because Esau was rejected,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   not because he repented and wouldn't be accepted, but because he couldn't repent.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's what it says. He found no repentance.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He found no place to repent, though he sought it with tears.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He had become so callous, so hard, so distant,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   that there was no ability for him to see how horrible his sin is,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   to see how great the mercy is, to feel horrible and broken about his sin
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and turn away from it to the living God.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He couldn't do it. It was all a sham as far as he was concerned.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And the question then, Kayla, is do you see the horror of sin?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's a gift of God. That's an element of repentance.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Do you see the gospel held out freely?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So here's what Jesus said about the unforgivable sin,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   because my guess is that's lurking right there in the background of your concern,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   is have I committed the unforgivable sin?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Here's what Jesus says in Matthew 12, 31.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And listen to these initial words, because they are meant to give you hope.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   "Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   People, that's amazing.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And then he says, "But the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Now, what is that?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They were calling him the devil.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   They were saying that he casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and therefore they had turned the world on its head.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They were seeing Jesus as demonic,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and they were no longer able to see Jesus as who he really was.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Have you gotten to the demonic point that Jesus is the devil,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and you now can pronounce judgment on him?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Or can you repent?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And if you can repent, there's hope.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And here's one of the most beautiful statements of hope that I know of.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It says from 1 Timothy 1:15, where Paul is talking to you, Kayla.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   of whom I am the foremost.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But I received mercy for this reason,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So here's what he's saying.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I was a blasphemer, a murderer.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He says this in Acts 9.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   A murderer, a persecutor, a hater.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And let this sink in.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Paul was a Pharisee.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He believed in demons.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   There is no reason to believe that Paul disagreed with the Pharisees in the Gospels
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   who said Jesus was casting out demons by the power of demons.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Paul was a blasphemer.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He had walked right up to the edge, evidently, of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And God chose him, saved him.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Why?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Paul says it's so that in the 21st century,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   John Piper, on a podcast, could say to Kayla,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   "Christ is that patient with you."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   That's why he saved Paul.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   He saved Paul for Kayla.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I really believe Kayla should read 1 Timothy 1, 15-16 that way.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Paul wants to be read as giving encouragement to those who feel like the patience of God has run out.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So, in the name of Jesus and with the authority of Paul, Kayla,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I think I can say to you, I do say to you,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Turn and come to Jesus, and you will find his arms outstretched to a prodigal daughter.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Beautiful. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And thank you, Kayla, for the frank and honest question.
