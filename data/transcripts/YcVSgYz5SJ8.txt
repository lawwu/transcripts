[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   And this notion that Stalin personally is responsible for these millions of deaths.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   There were millions of people pulling millions of triggers for all these deaths.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.760]   Initially, Hitler did incredibly well.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.160]   I mean, his blitzkrieg, incredible.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   If he had quit right there, he would have gotten away with it and probably be considered
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.160]   a brilliant leader by Germans.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.920]   Putin, he's made a pivotal error.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.600]   He has no back down plan.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.740]   He only has a double down plan.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.120]   For the People's Republic to take Taiwan, I presume it's going to begin with an artillery
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   barrage.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.800]   I presume that's going to be leveling Taiwanese cities.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Right?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200]   Just watch how it goes in Ukraine.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   I can't imagine the Chinese being less brutal.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600]   You're going to say that's okay?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   Okay.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.520]   Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Sarah Payne.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   She is a professor of strategy and policy at the Naval War College, and she has written
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.400]   some of the best military history I've ever read.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.000]   And we're going to get into history, strategy, all kinds of interesting topics today.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.480]   My first question, does grand strategy as a concept make sense?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.520]   So you have these countries, but the people making these decisions are individuals, and
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.800]   they have so many individual ambitions and desires and constraints, from internal politics
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.880]   to factions they have to appease.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600]   Does it make sense to talk about countries having strategies?
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220]   Before I get going, I have to make an obligatory disclaimer, which is what I'm about to say
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.600]   are my views.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.200]   They do not necessarily represent those of the US government, let alone the US Navy Department,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.120]   and much less the place where I work, which is the US Naval War College.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   Okay.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.640]   So now that that's over, on to grand strategy.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.880]   Yeah, it is useful.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   I'm going to define grand strategy as the integration of all relevant instruments of
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.860]   national power in the pursuit of national objectives.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.540]   If you think about modern governments in the West, they have cabinets, right?
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.500]   And they sit before the president.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.540]   Those cabinet portfolios represent the different instruments of national power.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.140]   And can you imagine trying to run foreign policy without having those people at your
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620]   table and coordinating?
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.740]   And if you look at countries that have not coordinated all instruments, for instance,
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.900]   Japan in World War II versus Japan during the prior period of the Meiji Restoration,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.820]   by the time the Japanese got into World War II, they're really prioritizing the Army and
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.200]   the Navy too, but the military as their main instrument of national power, they are not
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   coordinating with civilians, right?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.100]   They assassinate those people.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.200]   And they got into deep, dark trouble.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.380]   They didn't listen to their finance minister who told them it was unaffordable.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.300]   So yes, grand strategy is absolutely necessary.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.460]   And the idea is you have national objectives.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.980]   You want to increase security somewhere.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.700]   You want to improve your own security.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.900]   That would be your big objective.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.000]   You want to improve trade, whatever.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.340]   And then you need to think about all of these different instruments of national power and
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.780]   how you're going to coordinate.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.180]   Those who don't coordinate get into deep, dark trouble.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180]   Right.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.540]   So maybe having a coherent grand strategy is the ideal.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.540]   Yes.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.980]   But if we want to understand history, you just mentioned the case of Japan, previous
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.100]   guest Richard Rhodes, who wrote the making of the atomic bomb, talked about how after
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.860]   the war, the different branches of the military were competing with each other to see who
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.340]   would get more funding and who had access to nuclear weapons was a big part of that
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340]   and how many.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.560]   So if throughout history we look and we see lots of competition between the different
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.600]   parts of the government in ways that explain their choices, for example, in the case of
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.960]   Japan, why they invaded China instead of pursuing a maritime strategy, then isn't it more useful
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.220]   to just talk about the factions and the individuals rather than the strategy of the country?
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.940]   I think it's the individuals making their arguments for what they think the strategy
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.160]   should be.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.500]   And I'll give you an excellent example of how the sausage is made.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.020]   So I was using the Eisenhower archives a number of years ago.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.320]   And so here's the Allied commander from World War II, then president of the United States.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.040]   And what he would do is bring in all the relevant parties to whatever the decision is.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.180]   He would have them recommend various courses of action, and they would differ arguments
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.600]   and counterarguments.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.360]   And then they would hash it out and come up with some kind of combination of all or choosing
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   one of them.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.680]   But yeah, there's going to be a big debate.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.320]   People are going to have all kinds of different ideas.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.560]   In fact, this is one of the great strengths of democracy is you have to listen to the
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   counterargument or the counterargument is called you lose the election and the other
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.060]   party is in.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.480]   But the notion that you're going to streamline it and not have disagreements, that's what
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   dictators do.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   And they have problems.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   They double down on bad decisions.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.200]   That's actually one of the questions I eventually wanted to ask you is that in World War II,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.760]   we see that many of the countries had really coordinated and also really well apportioned
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.880]   budgets, and you did not spread between their different branches.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.960]   And in the case of Japan, they didn't, I guess, is democracy the answer for why the U.S. and
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.340]   Britain better coordinated their...
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.680]   Part of it, and I think part of it's a different issue, if you think about who are the strategic
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.080]   leaders of World War II, they're the conscripts of World War I.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.240]   When think about people slightly younger than you, maybe your age as well, if they survive
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.660]   to come off that front, then they come back and they want to start families.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.660]   It's the Great Depression.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.980]   It's terribly difficult.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.140]   And then when they get to the age where they're going to be strategic leaders, they have the
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.700]   horror of sending their own children in.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.220]   And so they thought deeply about what had gone wrong in World War I.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.060]   This is in the West, particularly Britain and the United States.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.820]   And their answer was institution building on a massive scale and integrating.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.700]   It is all elements of national power.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.840]   This is when you've had the National Security Act passed in the United States, setting up
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.860]   all kinds of organizations, et cetera, the National Security Council, among other things.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.740]   And then you're setting up the United Nations, NATO, all manner of things that that's a lot
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.020]   of it is coming off of World War I, the horrific war, and then doing a better job in World
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.020]   War II.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.960]   What I'm curious about is why, you know, you would think that the victors of a war would
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.540]   be the ones whose perception of reality is the most inflated, whereas the losers are
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.860]   the one who have to come to terms with why they lost.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.060]   Whereas we see the opposite.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.060]   The US had such good leadership, you know, Patton, Curtis LeMay.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.260]   There's so many great generals that came out of that time.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.980]   Whereas in Germany, Hitler himself fought in World War I.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.340]   So it's hard to explain why he made so many mistakes.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.140]   Initially, Hitler did incredibly well.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.540]   I mean, his blitzkrieg, incredible.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.660]   You think about Hitler, if he had stopped with the Anschluss, or he gets Austria and
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.420]   he's going to take Czechoslovakia, and then he says, "I'm uniting the German people."
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.700]   If he had quit right there, he would have gotten away with it and probably be considered
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.540]   a brilliant leader by Germans.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.720]   But then hubris, right?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.540]   The blitzkrieg worked so well, his generals told him he couldn't do it, but, of course,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.540]   it worked.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.480]   And then he goes further and overextends, et cetera.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.180]   When you look at what you think are great generals on the Western side, they are great
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   generals.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.400]   But their success has to do with a whole lot of other people.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   Think about it.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.140]   If we hadn't broken the codes, which is the British helped us do that, and the Poles who
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.620]   brought out various Enigma machines and other things, would it have turned out the same?
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.720]   If you don't have Henry Ford, who's turning his cars into tanks, and the people who built
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.020]   Liberty ships, would it have been the same?
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.540]   If you do not have scientists doing the Manhattan Project, would it have been the same?
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.820]   And think about the enormous mobilization with the United States, where Americans are
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.660]   all on board, and in Britain, and all over.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.900]   So when you go, "Ah, Patton," Patton has a whole civilian architecture behind him.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.900]   And so we tend to personify it as the general.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.020]   It ain't so.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.020]   It's everybody.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:13.740]   Now, you mentioned that if Hitler had stopped, I guess, in 1939, after he had expanded the
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.160]   borders of Germany beyond where they had ever been in history, I want your opinions on what
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.980]   is the latest at which he could have stopped, and maybe not avoided war, but at least solidified
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.720]   and consolidated the biggest possible empire.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.980]   So various options could be, one is just after 1939.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.700]   Yeah, they're quick.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.860]   What if he invades Poland with the Soviet Union, but he doesn't invade Russia after,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.440]   or declare war on the United States, and maybe at some point negotiates a peace with Britain?
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   Would that have been possible?
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.300]   Or what about after the fall of France?
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.100]   Then he could have just controlled all of Europe.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100]   All right.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.100]   A, I don't know.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.980]   But B, I think he could make the ploy of, "I'm just a continuation of Bismarck.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.700]   I'm fighting this limited war.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.460]   I'm uniting the German people."
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.980]   That one he could maybe be able to sell.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.460]   That's why he quit after Anschluss.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.240]   The moment he's going into genocide against the Poles, because Poland's why Britain gets
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   in the war.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.860]   Then once he's into Poland, we're off to a different race.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.860]   Right.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.500]   But is that a race he could have won, or at least settled, in that maybe if it wasn't
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.420]   for Churchill, and at some point, let's say, he gets out of the government, and then they're
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   just like, "You know what?
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.960]   We'll just let Hitler have Europe.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.000]   He doesn't go to war with America."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.700]   Is it possible that there's a world in which Hitler just controls Europe?
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.420]   Well, I think the problem with your question is that's not who Hitler was, right?
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.860]   He wrote in Mein Kampf exactly what he wanted to do, and what you're describing is not what
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.860]   he's about.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.380]   If he were about combining with the West and taking parts of the Soviet Union, maybe, but
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.460]   that's not what he's about.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.940]   He's about, has this whole genocidal program that goes with him.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.340]   There's another issue, is if you take too much, like if you're going to go kill off
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.940]   the Poles, the Poles never give up.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.340]   They went through three partitions over their history.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.100]   The Polish identity never disappeared.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.100]   But if you do that, it never goes away.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.260]   You will never have stable borders, and then it's easy for others to fund insurgencies
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.020]   because you have this dominated population that hates being dominated.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   It's not stable.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.660]   Then you think after Blitzkrieg, suppose that before Stalingrad, he had stopped, and at
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.540]   that point, didn't he control like 30% of the Soviet Union?
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.540]   He'll never hold it.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.980]   He'll choke on his acquisitions.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.820]   Did Germany have the power under another leader to just hold that whole section of Eurasia?
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.420]   All right, I'm going to flip this whole argument.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.100]   So you're talking about people doing territorial conquests, right, and taking things and butchering
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.020]   enormous numbers of people to get it.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   You can watch this in real time in Ukraine.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.340]   This is how it goes.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.540]   You're butchering a lot of people.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.140]   You're destroying wealth at an incredibly rapid clip.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.020]   You can do that, but it's really wealth destroying.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.940]   Since the industrial revolution in the West, there has been a growing consensus that that's
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.980]   probably not the way to do things.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:07.140]   We are far better crafting international institutions, international laws, treaties that we sign
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.940]   onto, the parts that we want to, and then we adhere to them, and then that allows us
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.300]   to go all over the world running our little credit card transactions.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.540]   No one kills us, and you can make a lot of wealth, right, doing that.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.820]   And that was the conclusion that if you look at since the industrial revolution, who's
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.660]   making all the money?
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.420]   People who buy into that system.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:37.020]   And the Hitler territorial expansion is, in a way, it's a real throwback to a pre-industrial
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.220]   revolution way of managing your national security.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.380]   This is how traditional continental empires always did it.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.920]   The industrial revolution with economic growth, compounding economic growth, offers a completely
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.420]   different alternative, which says we're going to do compounding wealth by having rules that
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.140]   we can all adhere to, and then we'll run our commercial transactions that way.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:05.580]   Now, why was Russia so robust against, not initially, but eventually, so robust against
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.700]   pushing back against the Germans?
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.940]   Despite losing tens of millions of soldiers, the government doesn't collapse like the czars
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:19.140]   did in World War I, and not only that, but a communist country is able to produce these
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.940]   really advanced tanks in large and reliable numbers.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.180]   There's so many mysteries there, like why central planning worked, why the government
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.860]   didn't collapse, despite the fact that Stalin killed off so many of his people, he would
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.860]   have been hated, right?
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.860]   So.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.580]   Ah, but Hitler killed more and was more hated.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.660]   What you're thinking about is what did the Russians do?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.660]   I'm going to flip it.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.660]   What did the Germans do?
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:45.860]   A useful concept comes from the Samuel Griffiths translation of Sun Tzu, which talks about
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.140]   death ground, what's death ground?
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.260]   It's when your enemy puts you on death ground, which means they're going to kill you, and
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.260]   therefore, you have no choice but to fight, because if you don't fight, you're dead, and
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.900]   even if you fight, your odds are poor, but at least that's the only way you're going
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.060]   to get out.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.260]   The Ukrainians initially welcomed the Germans, why?
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:13.940]   Because Stalin and friends had imposed the terrible famine of the early 1930s on them,
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.420]   and they couldn't imagine that anything would be worse than that until they met Nazis who
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.400]   then had them dig their own mass graves.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.940]   The Ukrainians rethought that whole thing, and if you do this to people, you will conjure
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.740]   a formidable enemy.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.520]   So that's what happened to Russia.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.620]   You can see it happening to Ukraine now before your eyes.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.180]   Go back before the invasion of Crimea in 2014.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:44.660]   You've got Ukraine, which has a very corrupt government, and people were at sixes and sevens
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.580]   about whether they want to do Ukrainian things or Russian things.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.700]   Okay, fast forward to now, where you have Russians blowing away the people who were
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.220]   most loyal to them in the eastern part of the country who didn't leave.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.420]   Their apartment buildings are being leveled by Russians.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.940]   Ukrainians think, "Aha, you know this idea that we can coexist with these people is over."
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.340]   And our irony is Putin's forging Ukrainian national identity, and wars often do this.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.060]   In the United States, we start out with our 13 colonies, and they're all very different.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   After the Revolutionary War, that starts forging a national identity, and by the time you get
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.620]   to the end of the Civil War, where you have northern armies, at least those people have
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.860]   been all over the country, they have a real sense of nation by the end of that one.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.260]   It's interesting, because the strategy we pursued with Germany and Japan was unconditional
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.260]   surrender.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.420]   Now, do you think of that as different than—obviously, we didn't commit genocide or anything—but
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.860]   do you think of that as different than the sort of total unlimited policy objectives
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.340]   that, for example, Germany had in Ukraine or Japan had in China?
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.220]   Or we also pursued unconditional surrender against the South in the Civil War, right?
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.900]   So how do you think about—because that's also something where your back is up against
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   the wall.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.400]   Why did that not result in the same kind of morale?
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:05.360]   Because the United States did not put the people of these countries on death ground.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.560]   The leadership had self-put themselves on death ground by where—basically, the problem
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.980]   for Tojo Hideki is if he backs down on anything, he's out of office, and then he doesn't know
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.700]   what happens after that.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.100]   So he personally is on career death ground, and possibly he thinks—well, we were planning
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.340]   to—that he would get executed at the end of the war.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.700]   But the Japanese people eventually figured out that they weren't on death ground.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:38.500]   In fact, the Japanese people were so exhausted by the whole thing that the society shattered.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:46.060]   But the United States was never going to put the German people—start massacring them
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.340]   in the way that the Russians massacred the Poles when they moved in, the Germans massacred
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.340]   the Poles.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.280]   How do you wind up with eight or nine million Polish deaths in World War II?
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   Think about that.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   That's a huge number.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   It's because they're massacred.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   They're being massacred.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   But there was a firebombing of, you know, Tokyo and Dresden and Berlin.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.780]   I think it was in your book that 84,000 people died in that one-night firebombing in Tokyo.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.780]   Yes.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.780]   Yes.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   It was terrible.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.840]   Why did that not make them—put them in the mind frame of a sort of total death ground?
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.360]   Well, A, I don't know, but B, Japan had been at war since 1931 in China.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.120]   They'd been sending large armies.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:27.280]   This isn't like recent U.S. wars, the counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.120]   This is they're sending hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy Manchuria.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   The Chinese don't give up.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.200]   It goes on and on and on.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.240]   So by the time you're getting to 1945, it's a long time.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   Also they had committed atrocities in China, and they knew all about it, and the atrocities
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.720]   got even better.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.160]   When there were wounded Japanese soldiers, their commanders ordered their fellow soldiers
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.920]   to execute them because they didn't want cripples going home.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.400]   They couldn't deal with them there.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:03.080]   And so rather than have the Allies pick them up, they executed them in place.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   Can you imagine how Japanese soldiers felt about this?
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.320]   How do we explain the high morale, the famously high morale of the Japanese military where
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.680]   they would refuse to surrender even after given orders by their superiors despite knowing
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.000]   about these things that you're talking about?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.160]   It's true.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.080]   It's because it's a different culture.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.640]   So in Japanese culture, you belong to in-groups or out-groups.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.400]   So the biggest in-group that Japanese belonged to was Japanese people and everybody else.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.080]   But within Japan, you come from a province, a locality, et cetera.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.600]   You go to school, education, various places.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.000]   You belong to a job wherever you have, and there are various units within your job.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.960]   And you owe loyalty.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   It's obligations.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.240]   In the West, it's all about liberties and my rights.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   In the East, it's about obligations to other people.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.940]   And so you owe obligations to all of these organizations.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.880]   And when soldiers are thinking about war, they're not thinking about grand strategy.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.260]   They're thinking about operational success.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.840]   So the moment you as a soldier start losing a battle, instead of in the West where you
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.600]   can retreat, you can surrender, and it's not dishonorable because you're going to live
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.180]   to fight another day.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.080]   In Japan, you're a failure.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.000]   And therefore, if you go and come home back as a failed soldier, you bring dishonor to
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.400]   yourself, your family, your locality, anyone you are associated with.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.080]   So that's why it is so difficult for them to surrender.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.600]   However, by the time you get to the end of the war, they are so exhausted.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.680]   Think about it.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.880]   Their economy is, I don't know, I can't remember the statistics exactly, something like a tenth
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   of our economy.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.240]   They have something like a thirteenth of our, I can't remember if it's coal or steel production.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.560]   And they don't have any local oil production.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.280]   They're importers of food, and they're not getting that food.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.600]   So by the time you get to 45, they're exhausted.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.640]   And it's a shattering that occurs.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   And finally, at the very end, you have Emperor Hirohito, who knew full well earlier if he
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:13.000]   disagreed, and he didn't disagree for a long time, that he would be assassinated or be
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   proclaimed deranged.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.280]   And he had a perfectly good underage son to be used as a figurehead.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.120]   He knew that he couldn't do much about it.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.960]   At the very end, when he decided he was about to get nuked, that's when he intervenes to
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.720]   break the deadlock at the cabinet meetings.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.820]   And there are a variety of people at the very top who realizes it's over.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.160]   Could Hirohito have intervened earlier?
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160]   I doubt it.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.440]   Let's go back more than five years.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.480]   If he intervenes when Japan is overextending in China, is there any chance that he could
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   have succeeded?
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.760]   I doubt he thought of Japan overextending in China.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.120]   What expertise does he have?
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.120]   He liked guppies.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.820]   He liked studying fish in his backyard.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.060]   He has no expertise.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.320]   And then, of course, there's the hubris of it all, that we're going to dominate this
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   place.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.240]   And they look at the Chinese as an absolutely feckless backward place that's had all these
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.320]   warlord things going on, and it doesn't dawn on them that by their extreme brutality in
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.520]   China, the Chinese finally get it, going, "We're not the problem.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.320]   The Japanese are the problem."
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:26.240]   And it is what the Japanese do that superglues China and is the great impetus to nation building.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.220]   You can see parallels with Hitler doing the same thing in Russia.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:39.460]   And also right now, Putin's busy canonizing Zelensky and creating a real nation out of
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.140]   Ukraine that's never going to forget these ongoing events.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.140]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.260]   Well, what I learned from your book that I thought was really interesting and also tragic
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:54.020]   because of the counterfactual was one of the strategies you suggested could have been that
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.220]   Japan could have, if it thought like a continental power, it could have allied with the nationalists
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:05.140]   to beat the communists in Russia, maybe waged almost a three-front war with Germany, the
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.660]   nationalists, and Japan, beat the communists, and prevented the communists from taking hold
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.140]   in China.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.140]   And given the consequences of communism in Russia and China, and how many lives could
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.220]   have been saved if, I guess, Hitler was beaten and then the communists were beaten, that
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.500]   Japanese choice just seems so tragic.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.060]   Let's say they do it.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.760]   That means Hitler forever.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:32.260]   And that means if you're anything but a nice Aryan, your days are numbered.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:39.220]   Certainly, it would have been the most massive ethnic cleanse ever in Europe.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.220]   Suppose the Third Reich had survived.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.500]   Maybe it had stopped at the point you're talking about where the German lands were reconstituted.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.500]   Suppose that had happened.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.220]   If you look at the Soviet Union, Stalin kills more of his people than Hitler had by that
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.460]   point.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.020]   And I wonder if we have sort of burnished Stalin's reputation a little bit because we
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.500]   had to ally with him in World War II.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.420]   But then the cycle we see in the Soviet Union is the inherent corruption and inefficiency
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.220]   of the totalitarian system.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.460]   And then it breaks down.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.080]   There's reform because people realize how crazy things have been.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.780]   If the Third Reich had survived, would we see that same cycle there where the system
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.340]   breaks down?
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.660]   And would we also remember them the same way as the Soviet Union, where it was so evil,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.140]   but at some point it just, you know, you just can't sustain that level of craziness forever?
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.780]   I suspect it'd be worse.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   Why?
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.200]   Because the Germans are far more efficient than the Russians were in those days.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.940]   And I remember, what is it, Nadezhda Mandelstam, she was married to the poet Osip Mandelstam.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.740]   And she was talking from the prison camps and saying, well, at least it's Russians
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.860]   doing this.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.100]   Because if it were Germans, there'd be no hope.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.860]   With Russians, there's always a hope because they're inefficient.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.180]   And she's Russian talking about it.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.900]   Hitler is, he's talking about annihilating entire peoples.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.740]   But so is Stalin with killing off the Ukrainian, entire classes of Ukrainians.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.100]   Yeah, well, his idea is the Ukrainians need to pretend they're Russians and then they
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.140]   can, that's fine if they do that.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.080]   The question you're asking is, it's not a happy ending, what you're describing.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.740]   It's a horrendous ending.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.220]   What is the scenario in which both Hitler and Stalin could have been defeated in World
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.220]   War II?
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.460]   Is there some system of alliances or counterfactual where that happens?
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.700]   I think the problem is World War I.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.660]   World War I has enormous consequences.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:42.080]   It is the West, in fact, all sides allowed their generals to make strategy.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.980]   No one is doing grand strategy in World War I.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.020]   It's all about operational success.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.400]   This is what we're all going to do.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.260]   And then the generals keep sending people, waves and waves of young men up over the trenches.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.900]   And what do you think is going to happen to them if you send them over the trenches?
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:05.260]   This is how you get these horrific death rates, hundreds of thousands in a battle.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.980]   In our own day, it's inconceivable.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:14.060]   As a result of that war, not only does it upend Europe by getting rid of the Austro-Hungarian
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.600]   Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, gets rid of all of those.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.580]   And so you have massive power vacuum.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:28.900]   But it puts two really pernicious ideologies on steroids, fascists and communists.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:35.700]   And that's how you get all that evil, is out of a gross mismanagement of World War I.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.100]   Once they're off and running, you've got problems on your hands, and you've got a long solution.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.500]   So back to your initial question, does grand strategy matter?
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.680]   Yes, it does.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.140]   Look at World War I when they didn't practice it.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.220]   And when the civilians, they allowed the officers to make all decisions.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.860]   Britain is a country that is marathoned by geography.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.980]   Britain built a continental-sized army.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.700]   That is not Britain's great strength in World War I.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:13.340]   And it was the beginning, the loss, the victory in World War I, but at horrific cost was the
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.540]   beginning of the end of the British Empire.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:24.540]   Britain is the only country that fights Hitler from all the way from 1939 to 1945.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.720]   Whereas Stalin only fights Hitler after he himself is invaded, and in fact, collaborates
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.300]   with him to dissect Poland.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:40.300]   After the war, Stalin, Russia expands to beyond any ambition that a czar might have from Eastern
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.960]   Europe to Manchuria, I guess not Manchuria, but whereas the British Empire is about to
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.780]   collapse and it loses all its territories.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:57.380]   What explains the differing outcomes of the two countries post-World War II, and why did
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.620]   the post-war objectives of Stalin succeed much more?
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.420]   Does it mean like retaining empire versus losing empire?
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   Okay.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.140]   There are fundamentally different kinds of empires.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.060]   So Russia is a classic continental empire.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.780]   What it owns is contiguous.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:17.540]   Britain's empire was all about trade and having enough coaling stations around the world.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.540]   That was initially what it was all about.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.860]   You've got to have coaling stations everywhere, and then you want to get the trade through.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:29.140]   And then what the British did is they trained barristers all over the world, or barristers
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.580]   and lawyers, and local people, right?
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:40.100]   And so it lays the basis not on purpose, but in fact, of having international law where
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.060]   people who were eventually going to be running these independent countries have a legal training
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.300]   to use international law to their own country's benefit.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.660]   But anyway, so Britain has this non-contiguous event, and after the war, it does not have
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:00.780]   the ability to hang on to them, particularly because nationalism, think about nationalism.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.260]   Nationalism starts in the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:11.700]   That's what Napoleon leverages, is the levé en masse, his armies, because French people
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.260]   feel nationalism, and it's incredibly powerful.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.540]   And nationalism has been spreading its way around the world ever since.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:25.300]   Those who have nationalism have fun hanging on to a non-contiguous empire, because the
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.100]   locals are going to fight and resist.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:33.060]   It will make the commercial advantages, well, they won't be commercial advantages, it'll
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.700]   be too expensive to hang on.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:44.820]   So Britain, in most cases, did not fight to hang on to its empire, it left and negotiated
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.820]   its way out.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.220]   Whereas France did the fight in Vietnam, which it lost, and the fight in Algeria, which it
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.220]   lost.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.220]   The British didn't do that.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.480]   Now, Russia is a different event.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.940]   It's all contiguous, wherever that Red Army is, it can hang on to it.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.660]   And so yeah, it hangs on to Eastern Europe forever, great cost.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.900]   But if you look over time, initially Stalin rebuilds and does quite well, but then you
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:15.100]   start looking in its 60s, 70s, all of a sudden their growth rates are not like Western growth
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.260]   rates.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.660]   And yeah, they're still growing, but the difference is growing.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.200]   And the compounding effects of this are enormous.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:30.340]   So that if you fast forward to now, Russian standards of living are, I think Russia's
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.820]   entire economy now, I know it's lost all these territories, is less than Mexico.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.580]   There's nothing wrong with Mexico, but the Russians have this idea that they have this
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.580]   huge, they don't.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.580]   They don't.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.660]   And then the compounding is a very important point because I think Tyler Cowen is an example
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.380]   in one of his books that if U.S. economic growth rates had been 1% lower every year
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.380]   from 1890 to basically the 20th century, they had been 1% lower each year.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.140]   The U.S. per capita GDP would be lower than that of Mexico's.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   Bingo.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.820]   And this is to give a tangential comment.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.900]   This is how sanctions work.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.060]   People look at sanctions and go, "Oh, they don't work because you don't make the whoever's
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.540]   annoying you change whatever they're doing."
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:18.260]   What they do do is they suppress growth so that whoever's annoying you, over time you're
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.720]   stronger and they're weaker.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.980]   And the example of the impact of sanctions is compare North and South Korea.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.020]   It's powerful over several generations.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.020]   Right.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.580]   Now, but to the question about why Russia did so well.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   Did so well.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.700]   Or in terms of after World War II, ended up with so much.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.660]   Before you say they did so well, look at the tens of millions of people who died.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.660]   But that's my point.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.020]   I mean, it's horrendous, the cost.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.060]   I should say why Stalin did so well.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.620]   Well, yeah, because other people died and he lived and he kept his dacha.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.620]   Right.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.260]   The reason I ask it in this way is I'm trying to understand the counterfactual in which
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.420]   it doesn't happen because it was so bad.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.860]   Did the failure of FDR to be sufficiently anti-communist, especially towards the end
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.760]   of the war, that contribute to how much, you know, land that the Soviet Union was able
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   to accumulate?
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.660]   Oh, well, there's a choice at the end of the war.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.340]   So there was some talk about whether to invade up through the Balkans and try to put Western
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.220]   armies there.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:23.980]   OK, so let's put you back in time as a serviceman and you look at it and go, do you want to
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:31.020]   lose your life by going up through the Balkans or are we just going to call it a day?
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.540]   And also, by the way, Stalin is a land power with a huge army in place.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.340]   He's going to be fighting at advantage.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.260]   Do you really want to lose your life doing that?
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:50.000]   And you have U.S. leaders looking at it and going, this is going to be good enough.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.140]   Because the costs, the costs are too high.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.480]   Because, I mean, there's this sort of narrative that FDR was almost a communist sympathizer.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   It wasn't that.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.080]   It was just this strategically didn't make sense.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.200]   Well, A, he died, right?
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:08.900]   So we don't know fully, but he was mobilizing the United States to prepare for war while
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:14.900]   the America firsters were saying, no, no, isolationism is the way to go.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.160]   So he was preparing all of that.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:24.380]   And yeah, if you're going to defeat Hitler, if you are an offshore power like Britain
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:31.120]   and the United States are, as in the Napoleonic Wars, you need a local continental power
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   with a huge army if you're going to deal with that continental problem.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.560]   Russia has that army.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.200]   So you're going to cooperate with Russia in the near term to get rid of the really big
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.640]   problem, which is Hitler, who's far more efficient than the Russians are.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:51.420]   He's also located near the high value areas of Europe, the industrialized parts of Europe.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.980]   So whereas Russia is further away, you're going to deal with Hitler first.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.680]   And then if you're going to have Stalin your ally, of course, you're going to say nice
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.900]   things about him.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.200]   Well, that doesn't make you a communist.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.140]   That just is managing an alliance where you're going to spit in his face while you're fighting
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.140]   the war.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.480]   But why believe him when he says that, and you all said that, there will be elections
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.580]   in Eastern Europe once the Soviet Union.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.480]   Oh, well, we tried.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.620]   We tried very hard.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.100]   The Britons tried very hard, particularly in Poland, because think about why does Britain
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.100]   get into the war?
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.940]   It's for Poland, and it's not feasible, right?
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.380]   When you get to the end of the war, and the Red Army is fully in control of Poland, there's
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.420]   nothing we're going to be able to do about it.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.380]   Americans have had enough of the fight.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.780]   There's cases in history where it seems there was a hinge point, let's say after the Bolsheviks
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.660]   take over Russia, or after Mao was consolidating communist control of China, where I guess
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:54.180]   in general our bias is to be anti, I don't know, it's always hard to like plan some takeover.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.940]   But in those cases, it seems like the whole, and the way in which they got in was so tenuous
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:04.500]   and contingent, that would it have been possible and desirable for us to extend greater efforts
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.380]   to prevent these regimes from getting in the first place, where we've had to deal with
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.940]   them for decades, or sometimes centuries afterwards, the consequences of them getting to power?
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:19.660]   Well, if you're a Russian of any persuasion, I suspect you'd be really angry that some
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.500]   American from across the seas is going to determine what kind of government you live
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   under.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.960]   That's a problem there.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.600]   And then you asked me earlier about overextension.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.160]   So are we going to go around the entire world and telling others how to live?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:39.460]   And then there's another issue, which is people like Stalin are a reflection of the country
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.820]   at the time.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:46.580]   The notion that one guy, Stalin, weighs a magic wand and everyone does what he wants,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.660]   and this notion that Stalin personally is responsible for these millions of deaths,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.900]   there are millions of people pulling millions of triggers for all these deaths.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   There are a lot of people who think it's a good idea.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.460]   So they are a reflection of a place.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.940]   Now we, in order to understand this, we personify it with Stalin.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   It's your earlier issue about generals.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:14.220]   We personify how wars turn out often by generals because that gives us a grasp on it.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.100]   But it's a much more complicated thing.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:22.540]   How contingent was the global rise of communism?
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:27.220]   Because you've done so much research on Russia and China, Chinese history.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.020]   In what percentage of worlds do the Bolsheviks take over in Russia?
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.620]   And if that doesn't happen, does communism spread to China and beyond because there's
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.660]   not the Bolshevik example and support of these global communist parties?
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.180]   The Russian revolution is essential to the spread of communism.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.180]   How likely is that?
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.060]   And what are the chances that the white army could have won?
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.060]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.060]   Unlikely.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:55.420]   If you look at Russian rail networks, they had the two centers, Moscow and St. Petersburg,
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.220]   which the Bolsheviks controlled.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.380]   So if you're anybody else, that means you're on the end of these different railway lines
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.340]   and there isn't the ability to link up with everyone, whereas the Bolsheviks at the center
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.940]   can fan out.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.980]   And so it gives them, they're also occupying the industrial centers.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.300]   So it gives them the ability to pick off their enemies in detail and win that thing.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   How about in China?
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.020]   What are the odds that after the war, the nationalists could have consolidated control
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.900]   of China?
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.900]   It's difficult.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.900]   The Japanese.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.340]   The nationalists don't get credit for all the fighting of Japan.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.660]   There was no way to get land lease aid to them during the war.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.100]   If you want to get land lease aid in, you've got to have ports and railway systems.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:44.200]   And if you look at China, the Japanese did a very effective blockade of China's coast.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.100]   So we're trying to fly stuff over the hump, which is the Himalayas.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.100]   And you're flying jet fuel over the hump so that the planes that you also fly over the
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.900]   hump, that you can then use them.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:01.140]   It's just, it's, it means there's no way to supply the nationalist armies.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:07.060]   Yeah, they're, they do some things in Burma, which arguably is a terrible mistake.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.040]   I suspect it would have been far better leaving Shanghai Shek with all that stuff.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.780]   And then it would have been useful for him in the final stages of the war to get a few
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.180]   wins against the Japanese to make him look good.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.200]   But basically the Japanese had eviscerated his armies.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.420]   And then think about as the communists, you constantly blame the incumbent government.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.860]   Oh, all of our problems.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.260]   It's all about the nationalist corruption and they are corrupt, don't get me wrong.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.220]   But the reason they're having troubles is because of the Japanese.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.820]   So the Japanese did in the nationalists.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.620]   One interesting point you made in your book was that not only were so many nationalists
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:50.260]   killed in the conflict with Japan, but there was a selection effect that the sort of most
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.500]   competent and brave were the first soldiers to die.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.260]   And that left, not the best of the crop left to fight the communists.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.560]   That would be speculation.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.940]   That's also a comment that's been made about World War I.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.980]   That Britain, for instance, lost so many of its best.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.240]   And so they don't go on to have children.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.720]   They don't go on to become strategic leaders.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.540]   They're unavailable in World War II.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.780]   Can you talk more about these consequences of what are the kinds of people who are most
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.220]   likely to die in a war and what are the broader consequences?
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.220]   I've no idea.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.700]   I mean, how would I know?
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.820]   Statistical evidence isn't there.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.780]   I mean, you know, the obvious is like able-bodied people are the most likely, right?
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.020]   And then the more able-bodied though.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.020]   It depends.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:42.020]   A lot of the people who died in World War II are civilians and they starve to death.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   Huge numbers.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:49.660]   And at the end of the war, what is it, in the Pacific, if you look at Japanese deaths
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.660]   from '41 when we get involved to '45, I can't remember the statistics, but it's like tens
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.180]   of thousands of Japanese are dying in '41.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.460]   And you finally get up to hundreds of thousands in '44.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.780]   But it's going into the millions in '45.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.760]   And it's because of starvation.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.300]   Is this the intentional starvation of the hunger plan?
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.300]   It's four times.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.700]   It's just facts.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.540]   If you're in a war where you've destroyed all transportation and the ability to get
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:22.660]   goods anywhere, and you've killed the farming population all over the world, you get famine.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.820]   And by the way, this is an argument for when people say, "Well, the atomic bombs, can you
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.180]   avoid doing that?"
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.260]   That ended the war really fast and probably saved millions of lives because they didn't
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.260]   starve.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.980]   It meant the war was over and all of a sudden you're starting to ship food around.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:43.380]   Why did Germany and Japan continue the war after it was obvious that they would lose?
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.020]   And speaking of the deaths, weren't millions, I don't know if it was a majority, but a huge
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.940]   chunk of the deaths happened after '43 when it was quite obvious that they were going
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.940]   to lose, right?
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.940]   I know.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.620]   Well, it's because they're all on death ground, the leadership, et cetera.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:02.660]   And then the population has been fed this story that if the other side wins, they're
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.100]   all going to be murdered too.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.660]   Wars are easy to start and they are very tricky to end.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.340]   And this has been your life, right?
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:19.580]   You have watched the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, easy to start, very hard to get out of.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.140]   And now we're into Ukraine and we'll see how long this goes on.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:28.000]   Speaking of which, a broader question is how well do you think the insights of scholars
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.180]   like you have been integrated into the thinking of military leaders where you're studying
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   like you have written these extensive books about how empires overextend and how invasions
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.340]   can be more complicated than you think.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.860]   To what extent does that actually percolate to the military and civilian leadership that
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.980]   we decided to do in Iraq war and Afghanistan war?
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.340]   You're asking the wrong person.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.780]   You need to interview those people and ask them what influenced them.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.780]   At my low level in the weeds, I work at the U.S. Naval War College.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:06.020]   We have officers from the United States and all over the world who come on in and then
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.180]   we assign them readings from the kind of scholars you're talking about, what we do in strategy
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.100]   and policy or case studies about wars, and have them think about a lot of the kind of
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.020]   questions you're asking is what we ask students.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.620]   And so we assign all these things.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.020]   How much it influences later in their career, you'd have to ask them.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:28.220]   But surely you must be optimistic about it or there's a reason why you do this work,
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.220]   right?
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.700]   Presumably you think that better understanding these previous situations helps leaders now
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.900]   make better decisions.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.260]   And then I'm curious, to what extent do you think that pipeline is functioning?
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.300]   I have no idea about the pipeline, but about me, I can answer those.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:50.180]   I grew up during the height of the Cold War and started graduate school as it was ending,
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.260]   but I didn't know it was ending.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.900]   And so I have the full up Cold War education where I did study the Soviet Union when it
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.380]   was and they had all these huge programs which no longer exist.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:07.460]   And if you want to make good decisions, you have to be knowledgeable.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:12.240]   You have to be able to make an accurate assessment about yourself and the other side.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.060]   And so I've devoted my career to understanding the other side.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.760]   And one of the things that I think Americans are particularly prone to is what I call half
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.460]   court tennis.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.340]   They study the world from their point of view.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.340]   So they're always focused on Team America.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.340]   It's like half court tennis.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.060]   They look only at their side of the court.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.660]   Balls come from mysterious places.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.660]   Some people get new rackets.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.140]   Who knows where they come from.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.940]   And then somehow I'm going to play this game.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:41.160]   Well, they no more follow football in this way.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.420]   Think about people who love football in the States.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.740]   They know about all the opposing teams and who's strong and blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.300]   Well, foreign policy, you need to understand the other side.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.080]   It's not just about me and it's all about the interaction.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.740]   So I spent my life, I was always wondered about, I'd heard that the Russians were really
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.740]   evil, right?
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   Growing up in the Cold War.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.620]   I thought, well, I'll learn more about it.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.100]   And so I studied first learning about Russia.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.140]   And then I decided I was going to learn about China.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.980]   And then I realized, oh, I'll learn about those two Japans in there.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.460]   So I got to learn about Japan and wind up studying their relations and tried to be open
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.360]   minded and understand the world from their point of view.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.780]   Not that it's right or wrong, but just trying to understand it.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.740]   So for your point of view, when you're picking up a book and you want to avoid half court
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.060]   tennis, give the book a 30 second rule.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   What's that?
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:32.420]   Go flip to the bibliography, flip through it for 30 seconds and see if at least some
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.020]   of the citations are in the languages of the countries being discussed, right?
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.140]   Because how much respect would you have for a book about the United States that has not
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.780]   a single source in English?
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.380]   I suspect the answer would be zero.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.380]   And how do you consume these?
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.980]   Do you read the translations or no?
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.460]   I can make bad spelling errors in numerous languages.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.420]   I read these things slowly, lots of large dictionaries.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.820]   And so you can look and you say, you've got my book Wars for Asia, go take a look at the
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:02.820]   footnotes in the back.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:08.420]   You'll see they're Russian and Japanese and Chinese and then read it slowly.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.000]   It is perhaps the best military history I've ever read.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.460]   And also I really enjoyed, remind me the title of your book on Japan, the Meiji.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.860]   The Meiji one, it's just a imperial Japan.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.860]   Right.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.860]   Those.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.420]   And you also have these other textbooks and collections of essays, which I, which I highly
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:29.060]   recommend because of the thorough nature and the diversity of sources.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.620]   Let's actually talk about your, your research.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.140]   Maybe tell me more about like where, where you've done research around the world and
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.980]   throughout your, through your different projects, because I think people might not know the
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.100]   extent to which you have for the years you've dug into the trenches on these.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.380]   I've co-edited with my husband, Bruce Elliman, a series of books on naval operations.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.400]   The United States is a maritime power.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:56.980]   If you want to understand the maritime underpinnings of U.S. security, go to those, particularly
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:02.620]   a book on peripheral operations, expeditionary warfare, which is what we do.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.620]   The expedition will be crossing the ocean to get there.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:12.020]   And commerce raiding and blockades, that that is a key to U.S. foreign policy.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:19.260]   And the problem is if you exercise a continental foreign policy, you're prone to get into all
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.660]   sorts of wars you don't need to get into.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.980]   That because we have huge oceans that separate us from our problems, it's a major point of
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.660]   strategy of whether intervene or not intervene.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.500]   So it's important to understand the maritime position in the United States.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.140]   So there are these maritime books that if you're interested in learning about that,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.260]   they're not fun reads, but anyway, they exist.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.100]   Now you're asking me about research.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.420]   Oh, back in the day, what was it?
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.140]   It was a year in the Soviet Union when it was, and then a year in PRC right after Tiananmen,
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.980]   it was delayed for a year.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.380]   And that was quite exciting.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.500]   There were armored trucks all around Beijing University, not to protect the students, but
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   to-
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   Protect themselves.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.020]   Neutralize them if anything happened.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.660]   And then three years in Japan over the years and three years in Taiwan over the years of
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.140]   just reading deeply in the archives.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.300]   Donald Rumsfeld has been much vilified, the former secretary of defense.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.420]   But one of his quotations I love is he said he wasn't worried about the known unknowns
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.200]   because he'd go after those, but he's worried about the unknown unknowns.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.780]   And that's why you do archival research is what is it that I know nothing about that
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.980]   is actually terribly important?
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.940]   So I've done a bunch of archival research in Japan.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:46.340]   That dries up about World War II, that you can get into military archives and their foreign
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.340]   ministry archives, but then it's much less afterwards.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:55.500]   And in China, well, China and Russia, they've both closed down.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.500]   There's no way.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.860]   I wouldn't go into either country at this stage.
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.500]   Oh, you think even more so than after TNM or during the Soviet Union.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.820]   It's more hostile now than then?
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.700]   We're in the Soviet Union while Gorbachev was in power and I actually got into the foreign
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:15.020]   ministry archives there, but only for the czarist period.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.520]   And in China, you could still get into various archives.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.580]   I was using the Qing archives and then the nationalist archives were much more closed.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.180]   And then now the archives are just plain closed.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.540]   Go to Russia now, get yourself arrested.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.940]   And China, likewise, they've shut down all of these archives.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:41.580]   So to compensate for the last, I don't know, it's not quite 10 years, spent two months
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.980]   every summer going to U.S. presidential archives.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:50.740]   So starting with, we didn't do it quite in order, but Truman, Eisenhower, and then this
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:56.860]   last spring we just did the George Bush senior archives.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:05.740]   And now I'm in Britain using their wonderful national archives, looking particularly from
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.580]   the 1917 to 1945 period.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:14.380]   And I'm researching the Cold War and you go, "Oh, but the Cold War didn't begin to '47."
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:20.220]   I would argue the Cold War began in 1917 because we have this notion that, "Oh, I decide when
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:25.100]   wars begin or my side, not quite if the other side declares war on you."
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.580]   And the Bolsheviks made it very clear that they had declared war on the capitalist order.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:37.820]   And Britain was much more attuned to this, worried about communist ideas infiltrating
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.900]   to labor movements and all this other stuff.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.060]   And so I'm reading their archives, whereas the United States was much more asleep at
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.060]   the switch.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:50.340]   - To what extent were, not the United States as a whole maybe, but factions within the
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:58.220]   United States, this is a common sort of theme that, were the educated classes very naive
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:04.700]   about communism and to what extent did that play into the delay of the United States recognizing
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   the Cold War?
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:11.100]   You talk about in your books about the Red Star over China, was that the name of the...
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.100]   And then there was another one.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.100]   - No.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   - Yeah, there was another Red Star.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.100]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.620]   Edgar Snow and then there's Jack Reed's 13 Days or something like that.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620]   What was it?
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.740]   I think it's George Bernard Shaw made a comment, is that if you haven't been a socialist before
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.900]   the age of 30, you have no heart, and if you remain one after the age of 30, you have no
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.540]   brains, that it's the idealism of it all.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:42.700]   And World War I seemed to vindicate so much of what Karl Marx said about how capitalist
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.380]   countries are just imperialist.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.900]   They don't care about the young, they just throw them over the trenches and destroy them.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:57.340]   - Which is so ironic given how communist countries have dealt with their populations and how
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.340]   callously they have voiced them.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.620]   - That's called the big lie.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:11.620]   And it is amazing how these big lies live and very powerful, but then when they crumble,
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.980]   they're gone for good.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.980]   People believed, even when I was in graduate school, there were a bunch of people saying,
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.120]   "Oh, Russia, it has no drug problem, it has all these blah, blah, blah, this is better,"
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.420]   because they're believing the Kool-Aid that's being dished out from Moscow, which is lies.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:34.620]   - Now, what explains the credulity of these people in the US and Britain on the Soviet
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:41.500]   Union's claims about, for everything from its economic growth to its humanitarian, to
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.860]   the way it dealt with its own populations, why were some people so asleep to this?
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:51.500]   - I don't know, but I suspect is the sins of the West are really obvious because we
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:57.100]   have an open press and for anyone who'd been through World War I and had any male member
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:01.780]   in the family who'd been at the trenches and came back and talked about it, it was pretty
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.460]   horrific, right?
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:07.260]   And so you can't believe that anything's gonna be worse than that.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:13.220]   Or if you go to China under Chiang Kai-shek, and he had a semi-free press, that's how we
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.500]   know about things.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:21.260]   And so you look at the incredible corruption going on there, you go, "Well, how can anything
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   be worse than this?"
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.900]   Well, actually, it can be a lot worse than this.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.940]   - You talk in your book, "The Wars on Asia and Elsewhere," about the Japanese occupation
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.700]   of Manchuria and how they industrialized the region and how at the end, I think it had
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:40.580]   50% higher GDP per capita than the rest of China, and it was the most industrialized
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.180]   part of Asia outside of Japan.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.660]   Japan also colonized Taiwan, and we see those are some of the wealthiest parts of Asia now.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:55.300]   And then we also see the impact of the communist counterfactual in other parts of Asia.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:02.300]   What should we make of, in retrospect, of the impact of the Japanese occupation, given
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.980]   the wealth of Korea, Taiwan, these other areas now, and how much the industrialization under
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.980]   Japan matter?
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.460]   - Let's go back in time.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:15.420]   If you get before World War II, which is one of the really huge atrocities that the Imperial
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:20.860]   Japanese Army commits, without any doubt, and going into someone else's country and
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:25.100]   committing atrocities, that's not a winning game plan.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:31.060]   If you go before then, if you think of the Meiji Restoration, and so they colonized Taiwan,
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.060]   they colonized Korea.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.900]   It was brutal in Korea because the Koreans resisted, and then the Japanese got nasty.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.340]   Taiwan, much less resistance.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.700]   To this day, the Taiwanese do not have this bitterness about Japan that the Koreans do.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:51.700]   All right, so I'm not gonna deny that there was any brutality, there was brutality.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:56.900]   But what the Japanese did when they moved into Korea and Taiwan, is they set about creating
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.900]   infrastructure.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.280]   They put in train lines.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.140]   They set about educating people.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.700]   Do they put them in the top positions?
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.340]   No, the top positions are for Japanese.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.260]   But they do things like publish all kinds of magazines.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.820]   So incredible numbers of technical journals about agronomy and things.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:19.260]   So that you have this incredible improvement of output because you're spreading knowledge
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.180]   to people, to the Taiwanese and to the Koreans.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:28.100]   And another thing they did, unlike the United States, is they do it from the bottom up.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.220]   They control the police force and the locality and from there all the way up.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.160]   So they really have local control.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.860]   When the United States went to places like Korea, excuse me, the Philippines, which happens
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:45.700]   at more or less the same time, Philippine War is like its early 1900s, the United States
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   wants to deal with English-speaking elites, sound familiar, who are located in the capital.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:56.200]   And so we try to negotiate that way, but it never modernizes what goes on.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:02.260]   These very traditional and actually not conducive to growth relationships of massive land control
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.840]   by landowning not particularly efficient classes remains.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.460]   The Japanese do it by literally building local organizations from the bottom up.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.780]   It's not remotely democratic.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.740]   People who disagree at the time are treated brutally, do not get me wrong.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:24.620]   But it turns out it's a very effective means for economic development because when they're
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:33.020]   booted in 1945, the Koreans and the Taiwanese actually have something to work with.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.680]   And then they're off and running.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.980]   And Chiang Kai-shek, who'd been horribly corrupt in the mainland, he could not do land reform
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.980]   in the mainland.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.980]   Why?
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.980]   Because that's his officer corps.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:44.980]   They will kill him.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:50.700]   In Taiwan, he can definitely redistribute Taiwanese land, no problem there.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:55.020]   He comes in with all the weaponry, redistributes, it's bloody doing it.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.460]   He offers the Taiwanese bonds, I think it's going to be like the lousy bonds that he distributed
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.460]   on the mainland.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.660]   And it turns out those bonds were worth money.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:07.700]   That I don't know how many years on it was that people actually collected on the bonds
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.020]   for all of this.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:19.260]   So the Japanese actually had many of the pieces for a really effective plan for economic development.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:26.060]   And if you look at China under Deng Xiaoping, who's imitating the Japanese, Deng Xiaoping
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.260]   is rather like a parallel, his generation to the Meiji generation.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.540]   And think what came after the Meiji generation, bad news.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540]   Well we're into Xi Jinping.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.540]   Oh, that's fascinating.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.540]   Bad news.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.540]   We're into bad news.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:43.900]   But do not deny the achievements of the Meiji generation, they're enormous.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:49.300]   And then because Japan does all the atrocities, they can no longer brag about these previous
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:50.300]   things.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.180]   There's so many interesting things there.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:57.940]   There's a book, How Asia Works, by this economist Joseph Studwell, where he is trying to analyze
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:01.540]   why Korea, Taiwan, Japan did so well after World War II.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:06.420]   And in the case of Korea, he tells a story where I think they have this factory where
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.140]   they're starting to export goods.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.180]   And they're working like six, seven hour days.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   And the floor manager tells one of his underlings, the money that I think the reparations on
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.140]   which we're supporting this economic growth in Japan, or maybe they're talking about just
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.420]   the infrastructure in general, that came at the cost of your family being raped by Japan.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.340]   So this is basically blood money that we're using to grow the economy.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.620]   You better work hard to make sure it was worth it.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:40.180]   But okay, sorry, the broader question I wanted to ask was, so the economic development with
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:46.640]   Japan is doing in Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan, if they hadn't made this mistake of fighting
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.820]   a war with America, let's say something like the Japanese Empire survives and isn't crazy
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.820]   militaristic.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.580]   I don't even know if this is a question, but I'm just thinking about the counterfactual
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.980]   where we could have this like really wealthy and prosperous area of Asia.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:05.260]   Let's go back to our wonderful America firsters of the 30s.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.780]   And the Great Depression hits, and it's a mess.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.620]   And so what we decide is we're going to have tariffs.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.840]   This is the Holly Smoot tariff in 1930.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.900]   We're just going to wall it off because we got to keep jobs for Americans.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.140]   Okay, this is half court tennis.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.620]   You're not thinking, well, what's everybody else going to do?
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.900]   And exactly in kind.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:33.100]   So for the Japanese who had been good citizens within the international order, they had maintained
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:38.780]   really high positions in the League of Nations, which we'd been irresponsible and never joined.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.560]   The Japanese, this pulls the rug on all the Japanese who'd said, we need to cooperate
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.220]   with the international order.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.220]   Japan's trade dependent.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.400]   What are they going to do?
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.540]   No one will trade with them.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.700]   Their closest people won't.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.940]   Okay, they look at the world, they go, well, we need an empire because we got to have it
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.460]   big enough so that we get food and the basics for us.
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:02.020]   And that's where, so 30 is Holly Smoot, 31's invasion of Manchuria.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.660]   So let's go back to grand strategy.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:11.860]   This is Americans having no grand strategy of not thinking deeply about, life is an interaction,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:12.860]   right?
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.940]   I can tell you whatever I want to, but then you're going to make your own decisions.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.340]   If I don't consider what your decisions might be, I'm going to be in deep, dark trouble.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:26.580]   And I think about Holly and Smoot, they didn't live to see what they wrought.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:32.180]   A lot of young men across the world died because of that.
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:36.860]   People like them, failure to think more broadly and think about it, the lesson of the great
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.860]   depression.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:43.100]   The moment the international economy starts getting a cold, there are meetings of bankers
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.540]   and foreign ministers the world over to prevent it from going crazy ever again, because they
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.560]   realize what the consequences are.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.260]   You take people who are poor already, and then you have a great depression, you get
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.620]   desperate decisions.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.760]   And then once you start a war, it's very difficult to stop.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.780]   So it's a great lesson.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.180]   So Japan then is making an ugly decision because it's stuck.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.060]   And so they go into Manchuria, which is where all their investments are to protect them.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.580]   China's got this crazy civil war going on.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:15.860]   Japan, if it had just sat in Manchuria and just sat, they probably would have been just
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.780]   fine because they do stabilize Manchuria.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:22.100]   They are bringing some income back in.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.820]   But the moment that they escalate big time in '37, they ruin their economy.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.500]   And it takes a number of years to play out fully.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.300]   It's a disaster for themselves, most of all.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:37.580]   Just a broader picture of what I'm learning from these military histories and especially
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.860]   your books is there's these bigger forces of like which country has more production
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.140]   and so on.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:48.900]   But then you can have these individual mistakes, a single mistake, like a single decision point
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.620]   by a single person that cascades.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.060]   And then, you know, you over extended China, now you need more oil, now you feel like the
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.900]   need to invade America and the importance of leadership in preventing these sorts of
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   catastrophic mistakes.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.700]   Yeah, no, it's what I would call pivotal error.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:08.220]   Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor is a pivotal error.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.580]   They are already grossly overextended in China.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.220]   They want to cut out foreign aid.
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:17.860]   They think, "Oh, remember that Hawaii is not a U.S. state, doesn't become a state until
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.660]   I'm 59 or something."
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:23.260]   And they probably take this racist view of Hawaiians, of whoever they think Hawaiians
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:24.260]   are.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:28.380]   And so their idea is we're going to take a newspaper, thwap the dog on the snout, and
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:29.580]   the dog will quit.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:36.380]   And instead, you create great power allies all across the Pacific for the Chinese.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:42.180]   So yeah, there are pivotal errors that you can make, at which point there is no return
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.960]   for the status quo ante.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.340]   You have seen Putin make a pivotal error, right?
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:51.940]   He was getting away with hanging on to the Donbass and the Crimea.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:56.100]   Now he made the pivotal error to try to take the whole enchilada.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.620]   There is no going back on that error.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.580]   Actually, I want to ask you about that.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   So you know, Japan invades Manchuria in 1931, Hitler invades Poland in 1939.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:13.320]   And in retrospect, we think of them as part of the same great global conflict, whereas
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.420]   they were separated by eight years.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:22.380]   I wonder if you think of Ukraine today as eight years down the line, or the things that
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.740]   could come, maybe not as a consequence, but at the same time as this, which could lead
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.760]   to another global situation.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.780]   Do you think that it could cascade into something like that?
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.780]   Of course.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.820]   Yeah, this is the problem with all of this.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.060]   Of course, it could.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:42.340]   And there are many people working to prevent this from happening.
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:48.140]   You see all of these meetings where our leaders are meeting with each other.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:54.980]   If you get into some global war with people with nuclear weapons, when the losers decide
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.860]   that rather than losing, they're going to go for one more roll of the die, which is
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.560]   a nuclear weapon, then the question is whether the people below them will actually implement
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.260]   the order, et cetera.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:09.620]   You know, when you think about low probability but high consequence events, I don't know
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.780]   what the probability is, but I know the consequences are huge.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.740]   And the probability is iterated over many years and decades.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740]   Right.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:23.460]   You've got to always not use nuclear weapons, right, as that Pandora's already, the box
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.900]   has been opened, the nukes are there.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.300]   Especially if there's no retirement plan for Putin.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.100]   Well, one of the things that's interesting from your book, I think you mentioned this
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:39.060]   explicitly in the wars in Asia, there's things that are seen by one side as we are deterring
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:44.580]   the other side, often seen as the other side as a provocation where, you know, the embargoes
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.500]   from the U.S. are seen as Japan as a deadline to attack.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.060]   I think you had some other examples like this.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.340]   I think people who are, you know, less empathetic to the Ukrainian cause have said, well, extending
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:02.220]   NATO, which we thought would be deterrence, is that was actually a provocation for Putin.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.340]   But what should we just generally make of that lesson?
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:09.340]   First of all, I think you should look at the people living in the countries in question.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.740]   So before we decide that we're the important people in the world, Americans or we're in
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.860]   Britain now or Britons, and therefore anyone in between doesn't count, I believe that's
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.100]   wrong.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:26.700]   So all of the countries that joined NATO desperately wanted to join NATO, right?
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.380]   And they've had a whole history of Russians doing terrible things to them.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.020]   I'm not making it up.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.900]   This is what Russia's been up to.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.420]   They have been correct that Russia is going to do more terrible things.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:47.340]   They were correct doing everything they could to get into NATO and also be in the EU.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:54.700]   And it's incredible in my lifetime, remembering what the standards of living of people in
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:02.180]   Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union had dominated and what it is now, since they have been freed
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:07.820]   of Soviet domination, it's been massive compounding of standards of living.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:14.220]   It's allowed people your age to travel the world, a lot of aspirations in their lives,
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   right?
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.220]   There's no podcasting.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.220]   Well, yeah.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.900]   But if when you talk about, oh, should we deny these things because we got some egos
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:28.820]   in Russia that want to maintain a continental empire, I cannot or you cannot change how
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.860]   Russians think about things, right?
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:37.540]   Russians have to, how they think about the things, that's their decision.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:44.940]   But if you look at Europe as a peninsula, you're better off with more insulation from
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.260]   Russia than not.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.180]   But isn't this another case of not thinking in terms of both courts or both halves of
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:56.220]   the court in tennis, where compared to the possibility of nuclear war, just nudging that
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.700]   a number up and down matters far more than whether another country in Eastern Europe
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.220]   gets to be part of NATO or not.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:08.500]   Well, I think what was hoped and hope has been said not to be a strategy.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:15.360]   The hope was that trying to get Russia to join the party, so trying to integrate their
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.620]   energy supplies into Europe, paying them good money for it, have them make lots of money
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.900]   on that, hoping that they would invest this into their road system, which is lamentable,
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:30.100]   and hoping that they would invest this to cleaning out their business laws, which are,
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.500]   it's horrendous trying to run a business there.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.740]   As you watched right now, as different things get nationalized and taken over and different
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.700]   business leaders who are successful wind up unaccountably dropping out of sixth floor
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.020]   windows and things, or old people always seem to fall down stairs.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.100]   I think that's a special way of offing people.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:53.740]   That was the hope, is join the party, because you will become wealthy too.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:05:02.060]   Russian standards of living have been stagnating for quite a while, that Putin's model of basically
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:07.820]   taking over your neighbor's stuff and then whatever you have, a bomb flat, bringing home.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:12.740]   It's not an efficient way to make wealth, and you're killing so many people.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:21.860]   So I don't believe that we in the West have this denying people of Eastern Europe, saying,
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:26.780]   "Well, actually, because the Russians have such an attitude, you get to be their serfs
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780]   forever."
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:33.620]   I guess it's not that it's just, but there are broader considerations, for the same reason
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:38.180]   that you were talking about earlier, that would not have made sense for Americans, would
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:42.860]   not have been plausible that we would have kept fighting further to prevent Eastern Europe
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.700]   at the time from succumbing to the Red Army.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.820]   The Ukrainians are doing the fighting right now.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:50.260]   Supplied by tremendous amounts of Western aid.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.300]   Yeah, they are.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.620]   But that's pennies on the dollar.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.820]   They're willing to fight for their country.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.380]   It's not about the cost to the United, it's not like the $40 billion or whatever.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.900]   How does this nudge the nuclear war numbers, or the nuclear war probabilities?
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.820]   Well, what's the nuclear war going to do, Putin?
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.260]   The Ukrainian forces are dispersed.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.260]   What's the target?
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.260]   It's going to be Kiev, I suppose?
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:17.460]   Or, I don't know, he thinks that he's out of options, so let's go bomb NATO headquarters
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.460]   or something.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.900]   I think the Chinese have whispered in his ear, and this is pure speculation, is, "Buddy,
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.100]   if you do this, everybody on the planet is going to get nuclear weapons.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.820]   And all of a sudden, we aren't going to have this little small club of people with nuclear
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   weapons.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.260]   And the consequences are going to be rather horrendous."
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.420]   And also, look at China.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:38.100]   It has more nuclear-armed neighbors than anyone on the planet, and some of them are totally
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100]   nuts.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.100]   Uh-oh.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.100]   Putin himself, right?
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:47.020]   Well, I would think, "Oh, well, let's try North Korea for a country that's got starvation
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.180]   in the 21st century.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.460]   How did you do it?"
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:53.260]   Although, on this point, another thing your books have emphasized is how often leaders
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.860]   make mistakes that make very little strategic sense and are very stupid.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.220]   You could imagine, even though it would be very stupid for Putin to escalate, especially
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:09.180]   if he personally is going to be, you know, there's no retirement plan, I could imagine
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.580]   him doing very stupid things.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.940]   Well, let's put "stupid" out of it, because it's not explanatory by saying, "Well, someone's
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.020]   stupid," because it means you write off understanding their reasoning.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:24.220]   So a lot of Westerners, when they think of governments, think about governments operating
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.340]   in the interest of their population.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.740]   So when their decisions don't improve standards of living, security, and things, then we say,
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.740]   "Those aren't good decisions."
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.740]   All right.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.580]   But that's not the game.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:40.600]   In China, for instance, it's all about maintaining the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.100]   to rule.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.440]   And if that conflicts with having higher living standards, you better believe they're choosing
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   Communist Party.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.780]   So you're watching those kinds of decisions going on right now, where their most talented
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:57.780]   entrepreneurs are being relieved of their enterprises.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:01.500]   Or Putin, as you said, he's made a pivotal error.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.180]   He has no back down plan.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.420]   He only has a double down plan.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.780]   Expect him to double down forever.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:15.020]   And then the question is whether all the oligarchs want to keep doubling down with him and his
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.780]   generals, or whether they, I don't know, give him something extra in his Cheerios some morning,
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.780]   who knows.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.860]   I feel like this is one of the lessons you were actually talking about earlier, where
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:29.900]   you don't want somebody to feel like they're up against the wall on debt's ground, where
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.100]   even if it would be an unjust sort of resolution, some sort of ceasefire, or Putin can stay
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.180]   face, I wonder if your sort of historical lessons would bring you to that conclusion.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:46.340]   Oh, and Putin, he will be back for more and understand that that's just the case.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.500]   But then what is the solution?
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.780]   We can't have unconditional surrender unless we're willing to.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:53.220]   Oh, no, no one's marching into Moscow.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.660]   The United States has done this for many years, is you don't recognize the territories that
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:03.060]   he's taken, which means the Russians are stuck with a sanctioned regime of some type forever.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:07.860]   And you go, oh, well, that'll weaken, certain people won't adhere to it.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.940]   It will depress Russian growth forever, which goes back to an earlier part of this conversation
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.940]   of it's really powerful.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:19.700]   And it was some Russians who themselves, at the very beginning, said, oh, no, we are going
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.060]   to be like North Korea.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.860]   Yeah, you will be.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.020]   That's exactly where he's heading them.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.220]   We don't control when the Russians reassess.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.620]   We can't even predict when or whether they'll reassess.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:39.020]   We can't predict whether there'll be some kind of incipient civil war in Russia, right,
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:45.220]   which would be, well, destabilizing by definition, who knows how that goes.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.740]   But the Ukrainians are fighting for their country.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:57.540]   And one of the things you asked me in an email about is whether superior finances wins wars
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.540]   or something.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:01.800]   It's superior alliance systems that win wars.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.260]   And it's interesting that the Europeans, particularly the Eastern Europeans, are the leaders of
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.260]   all this.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.900]   And isn't it fascinating that the Finns and the Swedes, who forever were neutral, are
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.380]   now all over this.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.780]   And they know.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.660]   So what is it?
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.260]   The enemy gets a vote.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.540]   The Russians have a vote.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.700]   As long as the Russians are playing this game, our best bet is to support Ukrainians.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:34.200]   Because unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, where the locals did not do the bulk of the fighting,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.500]   this is where the locals are.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.300]   And that's key.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:44.400]   And you also were emailing me and asking me about successful versus unsuccessful interventions.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.700]   When the locals do all the fighting, that's when your best starts are of helping them.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.220]   Actually, speaking of Iraq and Afghanistan, after World War II, our occupations of Japan
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:11:01.180]   and Germany were very successful in rooting out the toxic ideologies and completely transforming
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:07.220]   the society and culture, whereas Afghanistan and Iraq, we didn't have the same effect.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:11.940]   What explains why those occupations are so much more successful?
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940]   Easy.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:18.580]   One is a case of rebuilding institutions, and the other one is building them from scratch.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:19.860]   You can rebuild things rapidly.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.740]   And you think of after the war, how things were bombed out in Western Europe, and quite
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.160]   rapidly they repair buildings and things.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.940]   So both Germany and Japan had had an extensive list of functioning institutions, from local
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:43.740]   police officers, offices, to educational systems, to local, provincial, et cetera governments,
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:50.260]   and running the train systems and businesses, and all of this have been absolutely functional.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.420]   And so finding the expertise to recreate that is easy.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.860]   And of course, Germans and Japanese are going to be living there, so they are very interested
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.340]   in rebuilding.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:06.520]   And then what the key thing the United States then did, I know more about Japan than Germany,
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:13.520]   is the Japanese are hemming and hawing over what their constitution was going to be like.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.980]   And so MacArthur finally got fed up, and in one week he got his staff to write this constitution,
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.380]   and they're running around Tokyo, going to bombed-out libraries or whatever, trying to
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:28.500]   find examples of Western constitutions so they can pull it all together, because long
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.500]   before there's an internet where you can figure these things out.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.220]   And they're figuring out what the constitution is going to be.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.380]   And so they cook it up over the week.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.820]   And what the Japanese think, the ones who are dealing with, they think, "Well, you know,
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.820]   the Americans are going to leave, and so we'll go along with this constitution, but once
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.180]   the Americans are out, we're going to do whatever."
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.140]   And what Prime Minister Yoshida, he was the first post-war Prime Minister, he said, "Well,
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.300]   we thought we could change it back."
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:02.820]   But he realized because of the vote, universal suffrage, allowing women to vote, and there
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.940]   had been a certain amount of land reform, he said there was no going back.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:11.660]   It permanently changed the balance of power in Japan.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:18.500]   Another feature is the Japanese, the Imperial Japanese Army had so disgraced itself.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.860]   Their strategy had led to the firebombing of the home islands.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.620]   Talk about a total failure.
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:31.380]   So, and in Germany, the same sort of thing, you have universal elections and things.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.180]   It took a while to get the Western zones united because all the fighting with the Russians
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.540]   over the air zone, you eventually get two Germanys, etc.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:47.660]   But then you have a very competent post-war generation, both in Japan and Germany, who
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.740]   understood full well the horrors of the war that they'd been put through as conscripts.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.860]   And they are really intent on rebuilding their societies, and they're the miracle generations
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.940]   in both countries.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:03.700]   There's no parallel for that in Afghanistan and Iraq, right?
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.580]   They've never been developed countries.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.980]   Germany and Japan were developed countries.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.540]   So and then you think, well, how long does it take to become a developed country?
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.020]   Well, some people say centuries, right?
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:21.440]   And then there's a whole other piece, which is the Germans and the Japanese had a real
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.680]   sense of nation, nationalism.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.700]   So you don't have to worry about nation building because they have a sense of national identity.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.220]   You do worry about state building.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.300]   So we were doing helping with state rebuilding.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:39.060]   Well, in Afghanistan and Iraq, there's no sense of a nation.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:43.980]   They have these, I'm no expert on these parts of the world, but my understanding is you
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:49.740]   have these very different ethnic groups, many of whom want to kill each other, right?
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.840]   You just got a civil war going on there.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.560]   I'm talking about a death ground kind of civil war where one's in power and just ruins the
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.420]   others and other gets in power, they ruin the other people.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.580]   And that's what's going on in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:09.180]   In addition, because their internal locations, right, they're in the middle of continents,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.880]   and they're surrounded by a variety of neighbors.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.400]   And if you look at those neighbors, you go, ooh, a bunch of those people are gonna intervene.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.360]   And they're gonna intervene in very destabilizing ways.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   Very difficult.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   In Japan, it's an island.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.760]   It's hard for people to intervene.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:29.000]   Germany, we put a lot of money into it with having troops and getting the German army
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   and other things up and running.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.720]   And this will be Ukraine's future where they will be, well, they already apparently do
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.240]   have the finest army in Europe.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.320]   And then they're gonna make it very highly defensible before it's all over.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:53.400]   And Europeans, as a group, I understand that it is absolutely in their interest to have
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.880]   an impregnable border around Ukraine.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.680]   It protects them all.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.400]   And Europe doesn't threaten Russia.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.040]   They would love it if Russia would join the party.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.480]   Join the rules-based order.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.080]   You'll make money.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.480]   You'll do well.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.600]   Except the oligarchs in question, this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin,
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.760]   they personally won't do as well.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.600]   Well, now they're war criminals, so they're out of luck.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.800]   Speaking of miracle generations, the Meiji generation, as you have written about it,
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:31.120]   so many reforms learned from the West, improved every aspect of Japanese governance and economics
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.120]   and education and law and whatever.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:41.280]   And within the generation, then you have people coming to power who make quagmire after quagmire,
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.360]   make mistake after mistake.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.960]   And there's other cases like this where-- there's some cases where the countries managed
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.560]   to solve succession problem after a really competent generation.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.960]   In Singapore, after Lee Kuan Yew, it seems like the government has-- they've kept up
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:02.360]   the system, which promoted such efficient bureaucrats, whereas other cases where after
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.840]   Bismarck in Germany, you have the mistakes that led to World War I.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.680]   What was the failure that the Meiji generation made that their level of grand strategy and
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.560]   insight was not carried over?
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.960]   Well, I wouldn't pick on them because they're brilliant.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.200]   It's amazing what they achieved.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.320]   And you go, well-- so it wasn't perfect?
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.360]   No one's perfect.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.320]   So I wouldn't pick on that particular generation.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.240]   They're brilliant, as are Japan's post-war leaders.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.240]   The way I look at it-- it goes back to your initial question about grand strategy-- is
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.360]   institutions are really important.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.560]   Institution-structured decision-making.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.040]   You know, it's very difficult to figure out what types of institutions to build.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.080]   And when you see failings in them, you go, oh, I've got to do something next time.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   But this, again, is the brilliance of this evolving maritime order in which we live,
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:58.040]   where people sign on to the things in which it's in their interest to sign on to them.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.440]   Like you sign on to treaties, and then you have provisos of the parts you don't want.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.480]   And you join these international organizations, and then you influence how they develop, et
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   cetera.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.000]   So these organizations have been instrumental, the ones built right after World War II in
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.840]   holding the peace.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:22.800]   Japan, MacArthur's constitution, and then Japan's subsequent leaders has worked on improving
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.120]   the institutions that they have.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.800]   But institutions take a long, long time to build.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.840]   I think about it-- it's sort of like a spider's web.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.740]   So you spin, spin, spin this thing that's like Gossamer.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.660]   But then you spin enough of it, and then it really holds.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:43.080]   But then there are people like Hitler who come through, and they undo the work of others.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:46.280]   Bismarck, when you ask about him, it's highly personalistic.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.840]   That's not about an institution.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.720]   That's about a guy leveraging the king.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.880]   There's a reason for getting rid of royalty, running the show.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.840]   And then, yeah, there are emerging institutions in Germany, a general staff, and some other
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.800]   things that are very important.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.400]   I was about to mention, well, another maybe generation that managed to create good institutions
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.360]   was the American founders.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.280]   But then there was also the failure that led to the Civil War, right?
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.920]   So even there, some institutions were weak.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.240]   Our original sin.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   Right.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   Slavery.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240]   We were talking about Taiwan and its development.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.320]   We'll get into Taiwan in a second as part of the invasion.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.840]   But let's talk about Taiwan.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.640]   So that's where the Nationalists went after the Chinese Civil War.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.600]   I think until recently, the narrative has been that the CCP is incredibly competent
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:40.520]   and very good at engineering good policies and economic growth in China.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.560]   And then we look at Taiwan, and obviously, it's so much richer than China on a per capita
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.640]   basis.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.300]   Would that have been what China would have been like if the Nationalists had remained
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.760]   in power?
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:59.360]   No, because when the Nationalists came to Taiwan, they were in really deep, dark trouble.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.640]   And one of the ways the Taiwanese have maintained the moral high ground, which is necessary
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:08.700]   for them in order to guarantee foreign aid, is being democratic.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:14.800]   That their really exposed position put enormous pressure on them to democratize because the
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.840]   United States is sitting on them and going, "You need to get democratic."
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:25.320]   And also, the Nationalists engaged on a real comprehensive after-action report on Taiwan.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.120]   And they concluded, "Why did we lose?"
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.160]   Well, it was this incredible corruption and the need to do land reform.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.720]   I don't think land reform was feasible for Chiang Kai-shek on the mainland.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.720]   Why?
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.960]   Because that's his power base, all the landowners.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.040]   And you try to reform them, you'll get a headshot.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.960]   Whereas on Taiwan, it was bloody doing land reform.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:53.360]   The local Taiwanese did not appreciate getting expropriated, and there were massacres over
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   it.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.400]   Although in Korea, I think Park did land reform, and that was native.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.720]   Syngman Rhee apparently did it even earlier.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.040]   One in the land reform they did there was the Japanese had large expropriated areas,
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.080]   so it was easier to do that.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.040]   And so Syngman Rhee does land reform immediately.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:19.000]   It's not been well-studied, and it'd be fascinating if someone actually did study it.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.960]   And it probably helps explain why tremendous loyalty within the Korean armed forces to
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.160]   the South Korean government.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.360]   And how it works makes the interesting point that because these countries are so overflowing
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.280]   with labor that it makes sense in these countries.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.640]   So instead of having a single landowners with large tracts of land, having lots of peasants
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.160]   who can tend to mechanization, maybe not the best idea when you have so much labor that
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.520]   can actually do these things that are not scalable.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520]   Okay.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.920]   Anyways, going back to Taiwan.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.880]   So modern day, now China, because of zero COVID, less foreign investments, data intervention
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:00.800]   in the economy, I think consumers aren't spending as much.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.160]   The economy, the growth rate is slowing.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.040]   And obviously because of demographics, does this increase or decrease the odds of Chinese
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.760]   action on Taiwan?
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.520]   You know, I don't know.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.840]   I honestly don't know.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.880]   But it's, again, I think a better way of looking at it, or at least the way I would look at
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.000]   it, is talk about looking at consequences, high consequence.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.160]   It's guaranteed that if they go into Taiwan, it is a high consequence event without a doubt.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.880]   And what the odds are, I don't know.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.280]   However, if you listen to their speeches, they tell you they're going to do it, right?
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.880]   They're consistent.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.360]   And the West learned that you read improbable speeches, right?
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.160]   People read Mein Kampf and said, "Oh, this is a nutcase.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.160]   No one would ever do that."
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.960]   Well, it quite accurately represented people, even in dictatorships, they have to transmit
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:55.720]   message to population and they quite often very accurately tell you what they're going
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.720]   to do.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.000]   Putin has been quite clear what he's been up to.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.240]   Stalin was very clear what he was up to.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.480]   So let's judge Xi Jinping at his word.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.320]   And he says he's going to go for it.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.880]   Now, whether he's still in power, I don't know.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.300]   But here's a problem for which we don't have a solution, but Chinese people have to figure
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.800]   out the solution.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:21.720]   The Chinese Communist Party, to me, has clearly made the decision that it wants to maintain
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.580]   a monopoly of political power.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:29.160]   And for a while there under Deng Xiaoping, that worked because the reforms that they
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.960]   wanted to make for agriculture and things, they can maintain their monopoly of power,
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.760]   and but do things that allow people to get much wealthier.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.400]   And so that went in tandem for a number of years.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   Now we're at the inflection point where you have a lot of educated people and businesses
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.080]   who are really integrated into the world, and they want to make autonomous decisions.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.480]   Also, you want it with some very large, very successful companies, and they have quite
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.600]   a bit of clout.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:02.680]   And the Communist Party worries about this because what do people want at that point
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.920]   is probably some influence over political decisions, and the Communist Party said that's
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   off the table.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.880]   Okay, if it's off the table, how do you keep it off the table?
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.840]   All the things that you're talking about.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:19.040]   This 24/7 surveillance state, think about, in fact, since you have a computer science
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.760]   background, you'd have better understanding of this than I.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.000]   Think about the cost, if the United States had a 24/7 surveillance system, where you're
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.640]   literally doing it down to who's jaywalking, who's not, in order to put it into their social
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.680]   security score, who's kid in their classrooms rolling their eyes at their teachers, I kid
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.720]   you not, and putting it down as a ding on that kid's social...
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.160]   And also who knows what's accurate and inaccurate on the facial recognition stuff, so they start
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.960]   chalking up the wrong scores for the wrong people.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:55.600]   The cost would be incredible, just all the people power you're going to have to devote
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.120]   to this, and then all the false positives, which will be incendiary for the people who
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.240]   are falsely considered disloyal.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.000]   This is where they're at.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.440]   And now we're doing the National Disappearing Act, where, "Oh, we don't know where their
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.720]   Minister of Defense..."
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720]   He's suddenly like...
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720]   He's a non-person.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.560]   And, "Oh, by the way, what happened to the foreign minister?"
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.680]   "Give me a break.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.680]   Let's do grown-ups day."
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.120]   And then the cost is also so gruesome in comparison to, especially, maybe you can tell me more
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.880]   about this, but in the rural areas especially, aren't there so many cheap interventions of
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.240]   giving them iron supplements and folic acid and give them $20 eyeglasses, and you could
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.720]   raise the childhood nutrition that is lacking in rural parts of China by so much that would
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.240]   actually be worth it for the government if you think of the additional tax revenue that
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.200]   healthy people can bring in the future?
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.680]   They're so worried about it.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.280]   Xi Jinping's and other guys making a series of pivotal errors.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.480]   His handling COVID was just stupid, right?
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.280]   COVID started in China.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.400]   Go investigate it and figure out where it came from, and then it would be a non-starter.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.800]   But instead, they do the massive cover-up, et cetera.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.320]   And then all of a sudden, instead of just being unlucky that COVID started there, it's
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.460]   all of a sudden, "No, you're complicit.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:19.280]   And a lot of people have died across the globe over this, and it came from you, and you clearly
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.240]   were letting people out of the country knowing full well that they were vectors of spreading
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.560]   this disease.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.000]   This is a problem.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.760]   The rest of the world's not going to forget.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.120]   It's just too many millions of people who died."
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.080]   You were talking about the cost of the surveillance.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:38.160]   I've actually, this raises an interesting question of what percentage of the Soviet
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.200]   Union's GDP was dedicated to the NKVD or surveillance?
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.680]   I think when we were, the United States was trying to evaluate what the load of the military
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.000]   was on the economy, and the CIA was trying to figure it out to the best of their ability.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.240]   And then because they don't have a convertible currency, it's really difficult to, and then
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.260]   they're busy lying to each other.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.480]   That's a whole other thing in communist states and dictatorships.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   You're incentivized to lie about everything.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.160]   And think about the compounding effects of these lies.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.120]   It means I can't make good decisions because everyone around me is lying.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.960]   And then it gets worse at the top.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.100]   You're going to watch as these cascading things happen to the Chinese and the Russians as
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.460]   a result.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:28.680]   So it turned out at the end of the Cold War, gosh, I can't, won't remember it accurately
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:34.160]   over the top of my head, but if you did the whole military industrial complex, it's well
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.240]   over half their economy is being devoted to this.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.000]   Which is crazy because during the peak of World War II, the fraction of US GDP was like
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   45%.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   That's right.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.680]   I think they think Nazis were 55, but don't, I may be remembering these incorrectly, but
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.800]   it was horrific in Russia.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.240]   And the problem for Russia, so if in the Soviet Union, so let's say we're running little subunits,
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.320]   but I'm afraid I'm not going to get enough parts in.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.480]   So I lie about how few I have, even though I got lots more.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.540]   And then you're busy lying.
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:11.220]   So then when we compile macroeconomic data, A, we don't really know what the price of
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.460]   anything is.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:16.680]   We don't know the value of labor, of capital, and we don't know what consumers really want.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:25.080]   And so Russia is massively misallocating capital, labor, and they don't understand computer
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.760]   preferences.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.860]   So when you asked me earlier, are people stupid, it's more they've got all this incorrect data,
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:40.200]   and by the time they realize that something's wrong, they're already in a deep, dark crisis.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.560]   This is late in Brezhnev where the numbers are just a mess.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:50.720]   So when Gorbachev comes in in 1985, it's just a massive implosion.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:57.920]   And then he tries to save the beast, and of course his cure kills the beast.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.920]   Speaking of which, by the way, so after World War II, the production in Germany and Japan,
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:10.000]   these companies that were making weapons, Mitsubishi and Volkswagen and BMW, now they
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.560]   become world-class consumer, they produce world-class consumer products, GE in America.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.240]   Whereas in Russia, they have, is it the T-34, the tank that was like state-of-the-art?
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.320]   Well, apparently that thing was built on American chassis.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:32.160]   Apparently it's based on our technology that we weren't interested, and of course they
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.840]   took the chassis, etc.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.700]   But in World War II, do not forget about Len Lease.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.760]   This is another lesson of World War I.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.040]   Imperial Russia fell, disaster, absolute disaster.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.280]   Why did they fall?
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:51.680]   Well, no one bothered to supply them with, really focus on supplying them with adequate
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680]   weapons.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.760]   They had huge armies, but they're sending their young men in without rifles and saying,
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   "Well, when you get there, go pick one off."
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   Off a dead body?
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.640]   I think that means they've done no training.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.120]   You're just wasting people.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.040]   And then, can you imagine being that soldier and thinking, "This is how my government treats
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.040]   me."
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.440]   So World War II, the emphasis on supplying Russia is huge.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.920]   So what do we supply?
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.560]   We supply all the things that make them move.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.680]   So it's rolling stock and getting their train lines going.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.840]   They produce planes, but they can't do the jet fuel.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.840]   It's high octane.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.680]   You may know more about it than I do.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.160]   We're providing all that.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.480]   Russians will starve.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.320]   We provide a tremendous amount of food, you know, spam, which on email, spam, it comes
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.640]   from that canned pork and whatever.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.920]   But actually, if you think about it, if you get one of those little spam cans, that'll
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.240]   keep going.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.160]   And we spent that all over the world, and that's the origin of spam on the computer.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:56.280]   People by the end of World War II were so sick of spam, but anyway, we fed the Russians
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:01.840]   and we provided them all kinds of things that without it, they could not have fought.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   So fast forward now, we're providing those things for Ukraine.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.840]   Right.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:11.720]   The Ukrainians can feed themselves, et cetera, to keep them in the fight.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:18.840]   Why didn't the impressive industrial war output of the Soviet Union transfer into the same
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:24.480]   way that it did in Germany and Japan and these consumer brands?
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.000]   It's their model for development.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.240]   This is a big difference between their model for development and the Meiji model.
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:36.800]   The communist model is heavy industry and largely for the military.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:40.880]   And the Meiji, even though they wind up in the big military, it's about getting these
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:46.920]   consumer products in and light industry, and then they go on to do heavy industry, and
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.160]   it turns out that the Meiji model is the better one.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.660]   It just works better for an economy.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:56.120]   And so the Russians aren't interested in doing consumer goods, right?
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:03.600]   It's all about the communist power having monopolizing power and then playing God in
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.640]   whatever region they control, right?
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.320]   And dictating whether other people live or die.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   Okay.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   Let's go back to Taiwan.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.080]   What are the odds you would give of a Taiwan conflict?
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   Maybe you can give me your like over, under five years, 10 years, 20 years.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.080]   I have no idea.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.720]   I think you have to prepare for it.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:30.160]   And it will best position you to deter it, even though you may fail at deterring it.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:35.240]   And then if you fail at deterring it, it will best position you to deal if bad things happen.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:40.000]   Being at the Naval War College and seeing how people are talking about this, I mean,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.800]   how likely is it that the US would actually directly intervene on behalf of Taiwan and
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.080]   directly fight the Chinese?
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.400]   I think that if you think about Taiwan, what is it?
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.040]   It's a country of 20 plus million people.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.800]   If you look across the globe, how many countries have about 20 million plus people?
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800]   Lots.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.760]   It's probably most countries in the world are kind of that sizes.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:08.680]   So if you say it's okay to go level a country because for the People's Republic to take
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.640]   Taiwan, I presume it's going to begin with an artillery barrage.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:15.400]   I presume that's going to be leveling Taiwanese cities, right?
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.680]   Watch how it goes in Ukraine.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.760]   I can't imagine the Chinese being less brutal.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.120]   You're going to say that's okay.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   Our whole...
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.520]   Think about this maritime system of international law.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.880]   What is the fundamental underlying principle of it all?
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.000]   It's sovereignty.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.020]   It's the notion that just because you're big, you can't go and destroy someone who's small.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:41.280]   This is the fundamental basics of the whole thing.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.000]   Although in the case of Taiwan, it's hard to argue that one island that is right off
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.640]   the coast of China and which China, unlike any other area, has for decades said that
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.640]   they want to conquer.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.120]   It's not like they've been saying, "Well, once we get Taiwan, we also really want to
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.520]   conquer India and Burma and Vietnam."
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.920]   Oh, they've just been redoing their maps about what...
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.960]   They say, "Uttar Pradesh is ours."
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.080]   That would be a detail, right?
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:16.040]   But it's hard to see they conquer Taiwan and they get emboldened to then conquer Korea.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.840]   That's a cascading effect to worry about.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:18.840]   Look at Chinese history.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.240]   It is a continental empire.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.680]   What is the paradigm?
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680]   Territorial conquest.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.400]   Take a look at it.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.720]   This is it.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.280]   And they're not off that paradigm.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.760]   They're still on it.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.720]   On the doctrine of strategic ambiguity, what is your opinion on this?
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.760]   Because World War I, I mean, you have belligerents who are surprised that...
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.800]   It wasn't the Kaiser surprised that Britain intervened on behalf of Belgium and he was
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800]   so upset about it.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.880]   It was the Kaiser.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.440]   I don't know the details, but that man was...
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.440]   Someone said what?
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.960]   He wasn't the sharpest claw in the porcupine.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.840]   But just generally, is it wise to have this like, "Will they, won't they," attitude?
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.000]   Does it do a good job of deterring them?
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.360]   I think you want to be ambiguous in the United States because otherwise, it would enable
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.400]   Taiwan to autonomously do...
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.360]   Like under Chiang Kai-shek, if we had been unambiguous, the man might have done crazy
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360]   stuff.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.560]   And then all of a sudden, we get pulled into a world war.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   Right.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.600]   So, if you think about a Taiwan conflict, just because there's a conflict there does
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:24.040]   not mean the United States has to send its military in toe-to-toe.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:30.920]   I would think it would give China a long lasting timeout from the international world order,
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.920]   right?
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920]   It'll be sanctioned.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920]   Think about...
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.980]   This is what's so tragic about China.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:38.640]   Think about how many people have been lifted out of poverty.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.440]   So many since Deng Xiaoping.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.440]   Hundreds of millions.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.160]   It is a great achievement of our lifetimes.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.720]   It's happened since you were born.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.460]   And why did that happen?
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:55.360]   It's China's reintegration into the rest of the world of joining the maritime order, following
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.920]   the basic credit card rules of paying for transactions, and then your transactions are
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.680]   also guaranteed.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.840]   That is the win for China, the true win.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.680]   And taking Taiwan, who needs it?
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.560]   The Taiwanese are perfectly fine doing their own thing.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.360]   And they've made it clear they don't want to be taken over by force.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.520]   Who would be?
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.800]   So the problem in China is the Communist Party wants to maintain its monopoly on power.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.480]   And so it used to claim the moral rectitude card.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.360]   Well, they can't do that anymore, they're so corrupt.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.840]   And they used to claim the economic growth card.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.760]   Well, that one's going away.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.640]   They're left with one card, it's the nationalism card.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:40.000]   And they're playing it but hard because it's a unifying thing for Chinese, for the Han
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.800]   ethnic group in China, who constitute the overwhelming majority, that Taiwan should
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   be theirs.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.320]   It's a mistake.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.680]   It will be a pivotal error if they make that mistake.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.620]   But guess what?
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:58.920]   Other countries cannot control what the Chinese government decides to do.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.320]   It's foolish to think you can control it.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.080]   It's beyond your abilities.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:08.960]   Although we can't control whether we get in a head war with another global superpower.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:16.480]   What are the odds you would give to a war between China and the US going nuclear?
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:23.520]   It would be the most catastrophic error imaginable for the United States and China to have a
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.600]   military conflict.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.320]   There will be no winners.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.040]   There will be massive numbers of losers.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.940]   All right, let's talk about nuclear weapons for a minute.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:38.740]   Think about how Americans are so mad at each other about wearing a mask or not wearing
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:39.740]   a mask.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.900]   Talk about something that's stupid.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.200]   Talk about something that's not a big deal, wearing a mask or not.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.580]   If anybody nukes anybody else's city, do you think the world is going to be remotely the
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:52.740]   same way?
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:53.840]   Can you imagine?
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:59.460]   So we can't even be logical about masks or just letting other people do their thing about
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.460]   masks.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.780]   We can't even do that in the United States.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:10.940]   So we have many diplomats who are doing their best to prevent this eventuality, but understand
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.980]   that we do not control the decisions of others.
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:18.540]   For instance, I'm going to make bets that you don't have children, but if you ever have
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:25.860]   children and little ones, ones that you can pick up and put down, they will wind up doing
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:29.480]   things that you cannot, you're genetically related to these people.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.880]   You love these people and they will do stuff that you think is just wild and you will put
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.480]   enormous pressure on them not to do these things and they'll do it anyway.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:44.160]   So the notion that we can take a country of 1 billion and change and make them do anything.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.160]   Right.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.440]   But the reason I ask is, is an island of 20 million people, as you said, there's many
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.740]   countries with 20 million people.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.880]   Is that worth getting into an altercation that could potentially lead to a nuclear war?
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.840]   Ah, the global order, I'm going back to the circle, it's based on sovereignty.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.560]   If you allow this, it doesn't mean you have to go to a nuclear war.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.120]   You just never recognize whatever it is.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:16.200]   And then you sanction China from then until kingdom come so that they are not part of
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.080]   the maritime trading order.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.920]   And you tell them they need to cough up Taiwan.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:29.720]   Understanding China and the way the government works, could the CCP survive a failure to
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.720]   take Taiwan?
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.920]   If they invade, they fail.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.360]   And then because of that, they get kicked out of the global order.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   What do you think happens to the CCP?
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   I don't know.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   But look at North Korea.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.400]   Talk about a failed place.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.680]   It's amazing to me how long the Kim dynasty has maintained its power.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.720]   It's just unbelievable.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:47.780]   They're starving.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.480]   So don't count on any short term ending.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:57.280]   Think about those countries that are willing to cooperate with each other, not invade,
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.360]   negotiate their disagreements, work through international organizations, improve international
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   organizations.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.680]   That world is what you want to protect.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.560]   And you want to allow people to come and join.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:17.760]   So if Russia changes its mind, new government, et cetera, you want to bring them back into
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.040]   just the way Japan and Germany were brought back in.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.680]   You want to protect that order forever.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.000]   Our prosperity is based on it.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.280]   And it involves serious defense spending, et cetera.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.280]   And others who want to do the problem with the Communist Party paradigm of we're going
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.520]   to have a monopoly, it's a route to poverty.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.520]   Think about it.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.600]   When the Communists took over, they didn't restore grain harvest that had happened during
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.240]   the Civil War, the 1930s version, until after Mao was dead.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.080]   It's incredible.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.880]   It's a really lousy system for promoting economic growth.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.920]   And it matters in a poor country, right?
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:03.000]   It's going to determine your poor per capita standard of living.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.960]   And the poorer you are, the more that makes a huge difference to you to have something.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.360]   Communism doesn't produce wealth.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.600]   It's an incredibly effective way for taking power within a failing state and putting a
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.760]   dictatorship in power.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.240]   It's incredibly good at that.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:21.400]   But it doesn't deliver prosperity afterwards.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   Since World War II, I don't know if this is fair to say that our Navy has not been tested
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.360]   to the same extent as our Air Force and Army in the engagements we've had.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.520]   None of our forces have been as tested.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.920]   The Marines are the most in the Army because they're doing land engagements.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.880]   But if you think that Iraq or Afghanistan is a peer competitor, give me a break.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.160]   I think our GDP is like 325 times that of Afghanistan.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.560]   It is a different event, which is why the Ukrainians are looking at us when they get
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.400]   advice from us going, "Excuse me."
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:58.160]   So given that that's the case, I mean, how confident should we be that, you know, we
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.600]   have these like $15 billion carriers.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.720]   And even in these war games, many of them go down.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.800]   I was talking to the other person I interviewed in the UK, it was Dominic Cummings, who was
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.640]   the chief advisor to the previous government.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.080]   And he said that in the war games for the British carriers to survive, they have to
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.800]   exit the zone of contention, which would make them useless.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.200]   So how worried should we be about our preparedness for a naval war?
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.200]   You always need to be prepared.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.360]   You have to be thinking about it constantly.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:33.880]   What our carriers have been incredibly useful is going toe to toe with a peer competitor.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.680]   What you're describing, the vulnerabilities are absolutely there, particularly if you
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.920]   want to get up close and personal.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.960]   On the other hand, what a carrier provides you is all over the world, it gives you a
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.960]   base.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:51.240]   So if you're not going after a peer competitor, then they're incredibly useful, right?
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.920]   And we own them.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:58.160]   And then the question now is going forward, do you want to build more carriers?
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.200]   Or do you want to build something smaller that just takes drones?
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.560]   Or what are you doing?
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.420]   And that's the big decision, and I'm not qualified to answer it.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:11.200]   But for the ones that you have, they're tremendously useful for doing these non-peer events.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.840]   And again, I am not qualified to answer operational questions like these.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.440]   I guess I am curious about it, though, because we are seeing in Ukraine, you know, these
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.600]   drones that are taking out extremely expensive tanks.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.000]   The impact of asymmetric warfare, how do you see that shaping?
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.440]   Warfare has always been asymmetric.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.920]   Isn't that the game?
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:35.000]   You figure out whatever they've got and then you do something different, which is the asymmetry.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]   Right.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000]   Or the thing of just having like cheap drone armies that can, you know, debilitate billion
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.440]   dollar, million dollar equipments.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.440]   This is it.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.440]   This is it.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:50.120]   And you're very much part of the generation going back to your education in computer science
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:57.880]   and these technologies, and apparently the printing that they're doing, 3D printing that
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:43:58.880]   they're doing in Ukraine.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.560]   Yeah, it's going to absolutely change things.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.960]   I don't know to what degree.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.960]   I'm not an expert.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:05.960]   But yeah.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.880]   And the the other issue with the United States is we build a lot of these very expensive
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.320]   platforms, these ships and things and airplanes, and then you wonder whether you can afford
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.320]   to lose them.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:22.800]   And then thinking creatively, this is where war games come into play and planning is,
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.680]   OK, what would be the value of these smaller things?
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.720]   When they carry the water, when the time comes, et cetera.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.440]   And I think with you're going to learn a lot from this Ukraine war about what works and
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.440]   what doesn't.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:39.640]   What is your opinion on how competent and effective the military is in general?
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.160]   Because given that there hasn't been like a huge war for quite a while, have they been
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:48.720]   able to maintain the standards and the efficiency?
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.360]   I'm not qualified to answer that.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.040]   Literally, I mean, I teach at the Naval War College, but that does not make me an expert
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.720]   on how the Pentagon runs its business.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:05.800]   I think the general feeling about the federal government is there are incredible inefficiencies,
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.360]   but it's very difficult to get rid of them.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.400]   I mean, in the civilian part of it as well.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:17.560]   Once people get a federal service job, it's very difficult to get rid of that particular
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.560]   job, et cetera.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.320]   Are there plans around the Naval War College or elsewhere about how to make the system
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:25.360]   more modern and efficient?
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.200]   I teach in the strategy department.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.080]   So we do strategy, not all of this other stuff.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.080]   Is the era of great generals over?
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.080]   So through history, we have, and maybe you answered this already when you said that we
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.280]   overemphasize looking back how much these generals mattered, but for some reason or
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.240]   another, they've become historically famous people like von Molke or Patton or MacArthur
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:52.040]   and so on, whereas I can't even off the top of my head, like name a famous general of
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.040]   Iraq and- I can name one.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.040]   I'm sure.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:02.120]   Valery Zaluzhin, who runs the Ukrainian army.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.280]   Think about the people you're picking.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:10.880]   You're picking people who were part of a global war, a really high stakes war.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.640]   And then as I pointed out, we use these generals to personify a whole group of people.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:24.560]   So I suspect the ones you're going to find are going to be the ones in Ukraine.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.480]   And the fact that they've done as well as they have done so far is incredible.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.340]   And then it's not just the generals there, right?
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:37.560]   You have Zelensky, who is the public face of diplomacy.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.020]   It's incredible, right?
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:42.880]   From the night with his little soundbite is, what is it?
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.400]   I don't want a taxi.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.280]   And then if you think of the people there who are running the rail system, who have
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.200]   kept things supplied, or the people who are repairing their electric power plants, there
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:02.080]   are so many Ukrainians of different professions who are holding that thing together.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.560]   So there are plenty of great people to be found there.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.360]   What is a process that leads to the loss of civilian control of the military?
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.240]   For example, in Japan, you know, and why has the U.S. been robust against this?
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.280]   In Japan, it's interesting.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.720]   If you go back to the Meiji leaders, so who are they?
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.640]   They're the people who won a civil war against the last Tokugawa Shogun.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:31.000]   And they wound up, if you look at their career paths, is they had civil and military jobs
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.240]   as they swapped around.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.680]   And they all knew each other.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:39.740]   So that the head of the army and the navy and the prime ministers, they all interacted.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:42.520]   But they didn't create an institutional mechanism.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:49.760]   They did have like a cabinet, but they didn't have a full up legal forcing together of all
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.560]   the civil and military parts of the government and have them operate on a rather level playing
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.560]   field.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.980]   The army dominates.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:01.560]   So when that generation dies, everyone gets much more stovepipe careers.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.400]   So they're much better educated than their parents and grandparents had been.
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:10.200]   But the education would be strictly in the army, as opposed to, oh, well, the founder
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.560]   of the army also founded the police force.
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.440]   And he knew perfectly well, he knew the finance minister and had great respect for the finance
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.640]   minister.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.820]   And then you have people not respecting each other.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:25.720]   And I would suspect, I'm making this up because I don't know the details in China, but if
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.040]   you think about Deng Xiaoping, he's on the Long March.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.320]   He's one of the younger members.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.060]   He must know everybody.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.440]   And I know he's in and out of prison.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.240]   So he knows the people who are in, he knows the people who are out.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.320]   And so then when you get to Xi Jinping, they're a much more stovepipe group of people.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.920]   They don't have the institutions.
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:52.320]   Actually in China, they do have institutions for party control over the government.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.120]   So that's how communist governments have maintained very good control over their militaries.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.040]   In fact, if you look at communists, they're really good at civilian control over militaries.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:07.560]   So yeah, they have, in fact, that was Trotsky's contribution back in the Russian Revolution
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:12.480]   of how you take a bunch of white officers and veterans of World War I, but keep track
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.480]   of them.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.640]   It has to do with political and military commissars.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.440]   So the military commissar is the officer who's actually a professional.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.160]   The political commissar is the one who's got a connection with the secret police, who if
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.540]   the military commissar doesn't do as told, they'll come in and kill him, maybe his whole
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.460]   family for good luck.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:37.360]   And it's very effective in the commissar system.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.960]   These paired things, China still got the commissar system.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.680]   In the U.S. though, you have these systems of the officers from, like, I don't know what
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:48.200]   the actual progression looks like, but from like West Point or whatever.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:54.120]   Are they seeing the civilian, but from the time in which the higher levels of the military,
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.200]   from their education to their promotion, are they in the military the entire time?
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.400]   Or do they also have this wide, widespread experience?
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.760]   Military officers, they have a very extensive education, it's often a succession of MA degrees.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:13.680]   So some of them in very technical things, like, I don't know, nuclear subs, you better
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.460]   know how to run the nuclear plant and engineering things.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:20.960]   And then they come later on to places like the Naval War College to learn about strategy
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.520]   and other things.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:26.840]   In terms of civil control over the military, if you go back to the American Revolution,
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.000]   not an LR, you couldn't even get funding, right?
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.360]   And it goes very gradually over time.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.680]   And then you have MacArthur, who is just ignoring Truman, and he's making all kinds of threats.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:48.320]   Truman thinks he's got a way of settling out the Korean War, and MacArthur says things
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.240]   that overturn that.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:57.160]   So eventually you have MacArthur getting fired, which is telling military officers you can't
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.240]   do that.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.840]   And then when you get, what is it, under Barack Obama, we have some military officers shooting
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.200]   off their mouths and they get fired instantly.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.360]   To now, we have full-up civilian control.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.360]   But it was with MacArthur, he was trying to run policy, and he got himself fired, but
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.240]   he was tremendously popular.
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.920]   And it's the Joint Chiefs of Staff who actually fire him.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.520]   They agree with Truman.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:24.360]   They don't want MacArthur having his finger on the atomic button.
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.720]   It scares him to death, because they think he'll press it.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:31.200]   Why have the communists, speaking of the political and military commissars in their system, why
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.680]   have they been so good at propaganda historically?
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:42.760]   You talk in The Wars of Asia about how despite the imperial things they did and the ways
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:48.560]   in which they sabotaged things, they had much better PR than the Americans ended up having.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:53.800]   Well, if you think about how communists started, so if you get 1917, the Bolsheviks, they're
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:54.800]   really weak.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.680]   And you think about people who are weak, what can you do?
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.680]   Well, words.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.000]   Words are key.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.800]   So you're using words to cultivate loyalty so you can get cadres to come your way.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:11.600]   And you're going to use words, since you don't have the ability to threaten people militarily,
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.480]   you're going to use words to try to undermine them.
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.600]   And we've seen this happen the world over, I think, wasn't the story of Al Qaeda was
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.000]   pretty good at words and doing their recruiting, et cetera.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.640]   And then it takes the great powers that are the target of this for quite a while to realize
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:36.880]   that whoever these people are, like the Bolsheviks, you think they're crazy people, ignore them.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.240]   But then all of a sudden, well, gradually, you see the chemical effects and go, they
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:42.640]   are a threat.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.640]   And then you need to get going with your own information warfare.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:50.320]   And I'll give you an example, the United States had quite a robust information warfare during
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:53.120]   the Cold War and by the later phases.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.640]   And it involved like Voice of America and BBC, basically just tell people the truth.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.480]   Tell people the truth about just the news in the world, relative standards of living,
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.520]   and just pour it in.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.280]   And the cumulative effects will be to destroy the allegiance of people in their own governments,
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:16.280]   which is what happened at the end of the Cold War in '91.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.640]   We just ceased funding that because we thought it's over, end of history, right?
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:26.940]   And then I remember I was on sabbatical in California at the Hoover Institution and one
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:30.760]   of the people there was a great expert on Ukraine.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:36.120]   And this one there was RTV on and he said, "RTV is really dangerous, the Russian propaganda
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.120]   station."
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.120]   I said, "Oh, it's ludicrous.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.880]   They're just telling nut stories."
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880]   He was right.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880]   I was wrong.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.280]   He was absolutely right that those crazy stories started getting a life of their own.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.680]   And then if you look at Biden, when this war was just about to begin in Ukraine, he made
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:58.080]   the decision to release a lot of the intelligence about, "Hey, they're about to invade.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.560]   Here's where they're coming."
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:04.260]   And he has completely buried Putin in the information war.
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:06.240]   So it took us a while to wake up.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.680]   Now we're back.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:13.280]   And if you look at it right lately, what is it, is it the U.S. ambassador in Japan has
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.500]   some really lively tweets about the Chinese, hilarious.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:19.680]   You need to Google them if you haven't read them.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:28.600]   We're back on, and actually the United States is really good, Hollywood, the movies.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.740]   We have so much talent in this department.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.240]   So a lot of it's just based on telling the truth.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:41.000]   But lies, as we've noticed, take a long, long time to ... It's very easy to tell a lie.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.320]   It takes a long time to get all the facts to prove it is a lie.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:52.560]   Why was the Axis so much worse at collaborating than the allies, especially given the fact
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:59.480]   that the Axis were at least, it seemed like they should be in much greater collaboration.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:04.120]   They were all of these nationalist militaristic movements, whereas the allies, you have communists
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.080]   and democracies.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:12.280]   And in your book, you talk about when Japan's fighting Russia, Germany has a non-aggression
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.480]   pact with Russia.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.080]   When Germany does Operation Barbarossa on Russia, Japan has a non-aggression with Russia.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.440]   So if they had a two-front war, I mean, what could have happened?
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.200]   When Pearl Harbor happens, Germany isn't warned, but then gets dragged into a war against America.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.440]   Why didn't the Axis better coordinate?
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:31.440]   All right.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.600]   I think I'm going to turn your question inside out.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.680]   So you're thinking about, I'm thinking about alliance system.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:39.760]   So what did one side do versus the other side do?
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:45.960]   So I'm thinking about the alliance itself, flip it around to the enemy, which is the
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.040]   Axis powers put their enemies on death ground.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.040]   That is why the war began.
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:56.200]   That is an incredibly clarifying event.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:03.280]   And that got Britain, which really, really hated the communists, to ally with them immediately
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.520]   forever.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:10.000]   Britain thought that the dangerous thing were the communists, not the fascists in Germany.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.840]   But then when the Germans worked their wonders, the Germans, the Germans, Britain's go, oh,
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.640]   it's the communists who are the primary threat.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:20.920]   And so if you look at it that way, that's one thing.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.500]   Another thing, another concept to think about are primary enemies versus secondary enemy.
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:34.480]   So if I ask you the question, for Germany to get what it wants in the world, who's its
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.440]   primary enemy?
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.680]   And the answer would be Russia, right, because that's where it wants to do its Lebensraum
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.680]   and stuff.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.760]   And you go, well, Italy, who's its primary enemy?
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.640]   To do its Roman Empire III or whatever number they're up to, and the primary enemy would
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:53.600]   be Britain, would get in the way of those plans.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.360]   And then you go, OK, and who's the primary enemy of Japan?
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.360]   It's actually not us.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.360]   It's China.
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:04.040]   Because that's where, if they win, that's the prize to be taken.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.080]   So then you flip it around and go, OK, primary enemy of Britain, Germany.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.960]   Primary enemy of the United States, Germany.
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:10.960]   It was never Japan.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:17.160]   And we deliberately understood that Japan would never threaten us directly in the way
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:20.120]   that Germany ultimately would if it took over all of Europe.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.660]   And then you ask Russia, primary enemy, Germany.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:28.720]   So no kidding, we got three aligned on primary enemy.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:31.000]   So it's a very effective alliance.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.600]   Get rid of Germany, and it falls apart, which is actually predictable.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:37.000]   When you lose the primary enemy, which is Hitler, he's gone.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.260]   All of a sudden, we're back to communists versus capitalists.
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.780]   And the Cold War is off and running.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.080]   People act like it's a surprise.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:45.240]   No, it's not.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.240]   Primary enemy, gone.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.600]   Back to the question about the Meiji generation.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.560]   And then I think you compare them to Deng and the other reformers.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:57.680]   So actually, maybe this is a two-part question.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:05.240]   How similar were-- I mean, we see these sorts of industrializations across Southeast Asia.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:11.640]   What happened many decades later in Korea and Taiwan and China, did Japan just do that
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:13.200]   exact same thing earlier?
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:19.240]   And how come in Korea and Taiwan, you have a sort of dictatorship or an authoritarian
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.880]   government that leads this effort, and then it transitions to democracy, whereas in China
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:26.100]   and Japan, that didn't happen?
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.360]   What explains the difference there?
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:30.520]   Is it just the power of the US?
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:34.860]   Well, A, if Japan hadn't gotten into World War II, who knows what would have happened.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:39.040]   If the West had not mismanaged the Great Depression.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.160]   If that didn't happen, do you think there's a chance Japan liberalizes in the '30s?
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.160]   Perhaps.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:44.600]   It's conceivable.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.680]   But there's also another thing about human beings.
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:53.520]   Do we human beings require the absolutely scorching, horrible lesson to suddenly realize,
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.480]   ugh, you need to do these things.
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:56.960]   You're going to be better off?
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.040]   And that's where the searing lesson was World War I.
[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:04.400]   And that World War II generation set up institutions that have held the peace in the industrialized
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.480]   world-- not the third world, where all the proxy wars were fought, but in the industrialized
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.920]   world till very recently.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:17.480]   On the authoritarian regimes, communist systems that insist upon a monopoly of power of the
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:22.840]   Communist Party are a separate problem.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:29.960]   Authoritarian regimes, where you wind up-- what the places you're talking about in Asia,
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:36.860]   they invested extensively in education, extensively in infrastructure, extensively in industry
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:41.080]   of all types, and allowed all kinds of private ownership.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:45.480]   And the story of private ownership and collective ownership, you can have a lot of government
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.120]   planning, a lot of government ownership, and the economy works perfectly well.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.160]   And you can look at different European countries, different percentages.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:58.240]   When you go to 100% government control, you kill your economy.
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:02.080]   And so Korea, Japan, et cetera, didn't do that.
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:07.680]   And so they get educated people who then for 20 years really put themselves on the line,
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:10.960]   putting the pressure on their own governments to democratize.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:18.760]   Why was the Soviet Union in World War II, why was their strategy in Asia-- at least
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.440]   it seemed that way from reading your books-- so much better in Asia than it was in Europe,
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.120]   where in Asia they're playing off these different parties in China against each other, China
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.120]   against Japan.
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.880]   In Europe, they don't even-- Vichytan doesn't even see Barbarossa or doesn't prepare for
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.880]   it adequately.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.760]   Why were they so much more effective in Asia?
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:36.960]   I don't know.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:41.760]   I would imagine cooperative adversaries that China has been a failed state, had been a
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.080]   failed state for such a long time.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:49.560]   So it's hard for the Chinese to-- they're trying to glue Humpty-- put Humpty Dumpty
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:51.200]   back together again.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.280]   So what works in Asia versus Europe, where you have developed countries with a whole
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.600]   cadre of experts, which is not the case in China?
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.920]   So there are a lot more people in the West who are going to be reassessing.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:10.080]   And they got much-- they have robust institutions, goes back to institutions, whereas China is
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.260]   trying to just build these the first time around.
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:13.260]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.260]   Yeah.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:15.260]   Difficult in China.
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.840]   Why doesn't China think like a continental power?
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:23.400]   They have a vast coastline where a lot of their wealth is around that coastline.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:29.000]   And as back as the 15th century, you have these huge navies-- wasn't it Zengi, they
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]   had a bigger navy, bigger-- Changsha.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]   Far bigger ships than Columbus.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000]   It comes and goes.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.440]   So why do they think like a continental power?
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:44.520]   Being a continental power or having a continental location is not a choice.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.260]   It's a fact of geography.
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:49.800]   So if you look at China, huge land border.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:52.400]   Yeah, it's got a huge coastline as well.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.280]   But historically, where has China's national security threats come?
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.960]   It's the north, northwest, if you look where the passes are, of people coming on in or
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.480]   down straight through Manchuria, et cetera.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:11.120]   And China, in order to maintain its empire and just dominate China itself, let alone
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.160]   keep these other people out, has had to have a large standing army.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:21.120]   When it is built a large navy like Changsha, it's got extra pocket change and extra money
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.280]   than you can go do this.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:31.280]   But if that changes and you have trouble with people on your borders, you've got to spend
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:32.660]   your money that way.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:37.800]   It's very difficult to have a world-class navy and a world-class army.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:42.960]   If you think about Britain, it maintained the big navy and always had a tiny army until
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:49.280]   they ramped it up in World War I, which was the beginning of the end for them, as being
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.920]   the dominant power that they had been.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:57.920]   What level of competence should we assign our estimates of how well the PLA would function
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:58.920]   in a war?
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.760]   Whereas at least the United States military has had these practice runs in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.840]   we don't even know what the modern PLA, how that actually would function in a war.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.760]   And obviously, as you were mentioning earlier, in authoritarian systems, there's this lack
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:21.320]   of information and feedback that could lead to all kinds of catastrophes where people
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.720]   are not prepared.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.480]   What should we think of the PLA's competence?
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.480]   I don't know.
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.680]   But I think the people who are worried about that are the Vietnamese and the Indians, the
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.160]   people who are likely to meet them.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:40.520]   Back in '79, when the Chinese tried to work their magic in Vietnam, they had massive casualties.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:47.280]   The Vietnamese killed more Chinese in a matter of weeks than all U.S. losses in Afghanistan
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:53.540]   and in fact, all U.S. losses in Vietnam over however many years we were there.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.200]   You think the Chinese are going to be good at expeditionary warfare and sending these
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:57.200]   people anywhere?
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:01.000]   I mean, think about where would you be fighting them?
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.720]   So it's great they've got a big army.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.680]   So where are they going to deploy them?
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:07.960]   Why have the wars in China been so deadly?
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:12.160]   You have, you know, millions sometimes, yeah, compared to other theaters.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.160]   It's continental warfare.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:14.160]   That's how it goes.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.160]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.160]   It's the same reason Russia, so many Russians died.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.560]   And I believe if you measure the number of locals who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.720]   then they've had the civil war on top of it, it's thousands and thousands and thousands
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:27.040]   and thousands of people.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.240]   We go, "Oh, it wasn't too bad for Americans."
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.280]   For those who lived there, it was quite bad.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.120]   The Taiping Rebellion, I guess another...
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:35.120]   Tens of millions.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]   No one knows how many people died in that thing.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.120]   Right.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:39.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.000]   Well, I think one of the takeaways for you, so if you look at Chinese history over the
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.360]   course of all these different rebellions that go back hundreds of years, all these different
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:51.840]   wars they fought, and you look and you go, "Wow, millions of Chinese killing each other."
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:56.600]   A mark of good strategy is not killing your own, right?
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:02.000]   So if the Chinese have been doing this for a long time, don't expect them to be great
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.400]   strategists, which isn't a happy thing, actually.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:08.440]   It might mean they do crazy, stupid things that are so detrimental to themselves.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.440]   Right.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:10.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:12.880]   I have a couple of questions about studying history in general.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.960]   So I studied computer science, I talked to a lot of people in these technical fields,
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:22.520]   and being around them, I think I have a sense of what it means to understand a technical
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.000]   field well.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.840]   What does it mean to understand history or strategy well?
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:39.560]   Well, on history, you have to do tremendous amounts of reading, and it's over a career.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:45.760]   So publishing is really essential, not only to, you hope, give people the best ideas that
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:52.920]   you've encountered, but also it forces you to really come to terms with what you do think
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:54.840]   and why.
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:06:02.800]   And I feel after every book, whatever I was, I'm like a one click better, or like, you've
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:05.040]   probably got good eyesight, unlike me.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.360]   If you go in for an eye appointment, the guy will go click, click, and go, is it one better,
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:10.360]   or is this better?
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:13.720]   I feel like after a book, it's one better.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.720]   Do I see 2020 now?
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:21.160]   And then after a year abroad, like I'm in England for a year, where I just get to think,
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:26.060]   read extensively, try to be open minded, try to look for the unknown unknowns.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.800]   What is it I'm completely missing?
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:30.440]   What is it that I'm totally wrong about?
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:34.160]   Being open to reassessing, ooh, I got that wrong.
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:37.760]   So it has to do with reading extensively.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.120]   If you're going to be studying other societies, you had better read the language.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:46.640]   I'm not particularly good at any of these languages, but I do try hard.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:51.840]   And it's taken years for me to bungle my way through them as I do.
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.640]   But that's really essential.
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:07:00.760]   And too much of US graduate education, if you want to do, particularly in political
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:04.400]   science, where they ask you very important questions for international relations and
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:09.960]   things and comparative politics, they don't require them to have high-end linguistic skills.
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:11.360]   They should.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.560]   And part of it is, if you learn a different language, you do kind of a mind meld.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:20.480]   If you learn Japanese, you have to learn all of these formality things.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:22.680]   And what's called keigo, it's honorific Japanese.
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:27.200]   My Japanese is terrible, but learning as much as I've learned makes you realize how this
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:33.760]   hierarchical society, part of how it works, and get a sense of how they think about things
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.760]   and they categorize stuff.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:40.800]   So we're back at the opticians where if you do the language, you get a few more clicks.
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.960]   And having to live there when doing this archival research.
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.760]   And then just asking people questions when I lived there.
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:47.760]   Why this?
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.760]   Why that?
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:54.420]   And then what's funny is you come back home, and it gives you a new sense of what makes
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:58.640]   one's own country special because things that you just assume everyone does, you go, "Well,
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:01.340]   everyone doesn't quite do this."
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:04.760]   Have you come across something in your archival research, I don't know if there's a story
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:08.640]   of something super shocking or ... One of the things I'm remembering from your book
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:14.240]   is you mentioned that you had a speculation that both the nationalists and the communists
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:21.320]   help the Russians cover up the rape of Manchuria because ... Or they were both given hush payments
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.320]   or ...
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.320]   Well, no, they cut a deal.
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.820]   It didn't work.
[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:27.520]   And that's my interpretation.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:34.020]   And if you're a further archival evidence that I'm happy to reassess.
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:38.440]   But anything, maybe not exactly like that, but something you've learned just from like
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.440]   you found this, you dug up this thing that nobody noticed.
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.120]   Well, I'm not a ha person, a gotcha person.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.200]   But working at the Naval War College, so I started out a career, I'm studying Russia
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:50.200]   and China.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.640]   And so I'm learning about, do not realizing it, but I'm learning about two great continental
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.400]   empires, two of the greatest in human history.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:58.120]   And it's fascinating learning about that.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:01.880]   Then I get a job, because two jobs in one place, my husband and I go to the Naval War
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:02.880]   College.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.120]   And suddenly I'm teaching about British and US maritime strategy.
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:06.960]   What do I know about that?
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.440]   That's why my husband got me to do all these co-edited books about naval topics, just to
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.080]   learn more about it.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.240]   And that's where I got the idea about maritime and continental wars.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:23.680]   And I can't remember if I emailed you, I gave the Marshall Lecture, was published in the
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.600]   Journal of Military History.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.980]   And in it, I summarized my views on the difference between a continental and maritime power.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:32.880]   And that's one of my big career takeaways.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:35.460]   It's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:40.600]   So Putin honestly looks at the world, that if I control territory, that's what makes
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.600]   me secure.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:48.600]   Maritime powers, they start with Britain, which is, hey, mine's secure if I can maximize
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.400]   money from commerce, because then I can buy navy, buy allies with armies and stuff.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:10:01.600]   And then eventually, this order of organizing trade by international law, and the Dutch
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.320]   Republic is instrumental in this with Hugo Grotius, who is the founding father of international
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   law.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:10.480]   They want to run transactions by law, et cetera.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.220]   But this is an international order that's win-win.
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.920]   You join it, you get security.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.840]   You have input on how it evolves, because it's a work in progress.
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.660]   Whereas this continental thing is negative sum.
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.220]   And you can see it in Ukraine.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:30.180]   So Putin wants more territory, OK, he's got a zone.
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:35.960]   He took the eastern Ukraine, and he took Crimea in 2014.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:42.960]   But it's negative sum, because he destroys whatever businesses have been running in Donbass,
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.120]   and he absolutely kills most of the tourist industry.
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:51.920]   And then you can look right today, it's so negative sum in Ukraine.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:55.440]   He is destroying wealth at a really rapid clip.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.800]   It's really a stupid way to run, too.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:02.680]   And if you go up to Taiwan, so if PRC tries to take Taiwan, it's a continental view, more
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:08.360]   territory, somehow we think it's going to improve our security, no, they'll level it.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.120]   And they'll hurt themselves.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.600]   Whereas if they just ignore the Taiwan thing and say, oh, they're so annoying, let them
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.000]   run their own place, who wants them anyway?
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.880]   And then trade with them, they'll both make money.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:27.120]   And so when I look at this, that's my biggest career takeaway, is that if we go through
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.960]   international law and international institutions-- and this is not a hedge.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:37.160]   Political scientists love to talk about, ah, America, the hegemon, right?
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.120]   No other country in the world wants an American hegemon.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.200]   There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great, but no one's
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:50.720]   going to buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:51.720]   else around.
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:54.120]   I get it, we're big, and we're influential.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.360]   Other people are influential, too.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.320]   But this maritime order where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.920]   people in it, it's a win-win.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:10.680]   And you can look at some-- with Biden right now, he's doing all of these meetings with
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:18.840]   Europeans of managing of what's going to go on in Ukraine, et cetera.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:25.800]   And it's based on agreement of all these different countries chipping in, big and small.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.000]   And who's prosperous and who's not, may I ask?
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]   The maritime world order.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000]   Yeah, they are.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.320]   And who are the ones who have massively increased their standards of living since the Cold War?
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.560]   It was really the third world, except now we've got Wagner, or whatever's left of it,
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:49.800]   and also China's now got these private military things running roughshod over Africa, which
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.640]   all that's going to do is tank African growth rates, which for a while were going double
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.080]   digit.
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:01.960]   So that's one of my big career takeaways, and I tried to put it into the one lecture
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:06.600]   that I was asked to do in the one article, which is like a 20-page read.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:09.080]   It's a super interesting way to think about things.
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.360]   Does that imply, by the way, that China will never be-- I don't know.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.800]   I feel like a couple of years back, people were-- especially looking at the growth rates
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.120]   in China, they were thinking, oh, it's going to have the biggest economy, therefore be
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.080]   the leader of the global order.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:26.960]   Does your analysis imply that because it's not part of that maritime system, it will--
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.600]   even if it's-- let's say its economic growth picks up, it will still not be the leader
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.600]   of the world in the same way?
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:36.880]   Doing what they're doing is all going to depress growth.
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.080]   They could join the maritime order any day.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.640]   That is what, at the end of the Cold War, everyone wanted them to do.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.280]   Everyone wanted Putin to join it.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:48.400]   The Russians-- if you think about all the money Putin has spent on his crazy military
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:52.480]   stuff, imagine what would have happened if he'd spent all that on the Russian road system,
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:54.640]   because their road system is deplorable.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:14:01.400]   And imagine if he had devoted his attention to trying to have a better legal system so
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:06.400]   that people could start small businesses, get bigger, without having someone then come
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.920]   in on them for protection money.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.160]   Think where Russia would be now.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.480]   It would be dramatically better.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.280]   There's so much energy, so many raw resources.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.640]   Oh, and they have so many talented people.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:19.200]   But the Russians don't see it that way.
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.760]   They see it in this continental view.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:26.200]   And they're the ones who have to come to terms with what they think.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.360]   In the meantime-- this is why containment's brilliant-- is, in the meantime, those of
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:35.040]   us who join the maritime order need to work with each other.
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:40.840]   And then we contain the problem by saying, you cannot join us on equal footing till you
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.760]   behave yourselves.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:45.120]   You get a timeout, right?
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.520]   If you get a timeout from the global order, but we would welcome you back in.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:53.600]   The problem with Putin is he's done so much damage to Ukraine, there are going to be reparations
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:54.600]   involved.
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.360]   And the Russians won't want to pay those.
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:02.640]   What are the mistakes and biases that come about from self-studying history, as opposed
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:04.920]   to formally studying it?
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.600]   In what way is it most likely to be incomplete, your understanding of strategy or history
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:09.600]   as a result?
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.240]   Well, let's do history.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.440]   History's one thing.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:15.280]   I think about my education at Columbia.
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.120]   I had the most absentee landlord professors.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.320]   They just didn't waste their time on me.
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.240]   I just did a tremendous amount of reading.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:27.920]   And while I was there, I took twice the courses.
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:32.840]   I did the equivalent of two PhDs of coursework as a graduate student.
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:36.640]   Because going to graduate school is such an expensive event, and time, and money, and
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:37.640]   everything else.
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:44.000]   I just took massive numbers of courses to read the reading list of what they'd given
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000]   me.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.080]   And that was tremendously helpful, having some guided readings, et cetera.
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:56.600]   On the strategy part, this is where the Naval War College has been essential to my publications.
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:01.360]   In the strategy and policy department, what we do, and what civilian academia doesn't
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.280]   do, and it's tragic because they're better positioned, is it's a big team taught course,
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:07.840]   the strategy course.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.040]   All the students at the War College have to take the main strategy course, the main joint
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.280]   military operations course, the main national security affairs course.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:19.000]   And it's a one-year MA.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.400]   In that one trimester in which we have them, it's like four-fifths of their coursework
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:26.800]   is our course.
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:28.600]   And then there's a junior and a senior course.
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:31.520]   So we do teach two trimesters out of three.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.520]   All right.
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.960]   So because it's team taught and the lectures are given by different faculty members, so
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:42.280]   I attend everybody else's lectures, or I did originally, and I attend all the new ones,
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:45.920]   you learn so much from your colleagues, and then they learn from each other.
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:47.280]   And so you're asking me about Bismarck.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.900]   Why would I know about Bismarck?
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:51.400]   Because we used to do a case study on Bismarck.
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:54.840]   I had colleagues who actually knew something about him, which I don't.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.840]   And I listened intently, and I did the readings.
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:02.760]   And then from teaching strategy, I learned all these concepts, and I've given you some
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:04.280]   of them.
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.240]   And they're tremendously useful for studying wars.
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:12.760]   And I never would have learned about maritime powers without being the Naval War College.
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:18.760]   It is the only institution of higher education in the United States that focuses on the strategic
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.720]   prerequisites for and possibilities of being a maritime power.
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.760]   It is essential to know this to practice US foreign policy.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:27.760]   Why?
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.400]   Because unlike Ukraine, if you have a continental position, if someone threatens you and invades
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:37.120]   on a given day, you have a choice on that given day, the day they chose, either you're
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.560]   going to capitulate or you're going to fight.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:42.400]   So they determine when the war is going to begin.
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.280]   In our insulated position, unless we start doing terrible things to the Mexicans and
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:47.920]   the Canadians, right?
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:52.880]   And Mexico's our biggest trade partner, and Canada must be not far behind.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:56.920]   When there are wars that are important to our national security, we decide, like in
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:00.480]   World War I and World War II, do we get in?
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:02.000]   When do we get in?
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:08.120]   And that is really-- in Afghanistan, in Iraq, do we get in?
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.120]   Do we not get in?
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:14.160]   We could have avoided Iraq altogether if we wanted to, and I'm not a Middle Eastern expert,
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.960]   so you'd have to talk to those people about pros and cons.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.240]   Afghanistan, since we had been attacked, the chances were we were going to be in on that
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:24.280]   one because of a direct attack on us.
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:28.880]   It is incredibly important to understand this maritime position.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.960]   That's why I've co-edited all these books with my husband, the ones I mentioned to you
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:37.640]   about maritime things, which for us took us years to do.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.560]   But if you want a short course, so you get half a dozen of these books.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:44.240]   I realize it's half a dozen boring books, how did this happen to me?
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.240]   But it's actually a fast way of learning about what the maritime instrument can and can't
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:51.160]   do for you.
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.800]   The strategy course was absolutely essential from what I know about strategy.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:58.920]   I have done my best in books to put what I have learned there.
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:04.080]   The one I'm working on, on the Cold War, is going to be organized around these strategic
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:09.800]   concepts of how did each side try to manipulate the other, and how did the medium powers try
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.440]   to wing in on the game, and what are the strategies that they're using, the paradigms, et cetera.
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:20.360]   So I'm going to try and pour as much of this in there because this is what education is.
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:23.840]   It's passing the baton from one generation to the other, saying this is what I've learned
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.800]   over the course of my career.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:26.800]   You're off and running.
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:28.280]   I'm really excited to read that actually.
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.200]   It'll take me years to finish it.
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:31.960]   It's not happening anytime soon.
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:37.600]   And then final question, my audience probably is overwhelming represented in technology
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.200]   and those kinds of worlds.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:45.120]   What is it that you especially want them to understand about history and strategy?
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.080]   Oh, I think what I want them, on history and strategy, it's going to be a well-informed
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:52.080]   person and read broadly.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:57.760]   But I think for them, technology, they need to think broadly of these technologies about
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.260]   which they have deep expertise.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:06.080]   Do these technologies privilege dictatorships or democracies?
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.640]   I do not know the answer to these things.
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:14.120]   And when you're creating architectures for things like the internet, et cetera, think
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.520]   about these things.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.640]   Think about consequences.
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:23.280]   I suspect, and I don't know this, that when China does its Belt Road Initiative, I would
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.320]   presume it's also selling a nice little IT package to keep the dictator in power, that
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:32.960]   if you want to keep track of your population here, this is the IT thing you need to do
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:35.200]   to firewall this, that, and the other thing.
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:41.440]   So since the West is the part of the world that has developed most of these technologies
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:47.600]   and continues to be at the forefront of it, think very deeply about whether you're going
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.040]   to ultimately privilege dictatorships over democracies.
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:58.200]   Because the reason tech has been able to be so vibrant, think about it, is you live within
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:04.560]   the castle walls of this maritime order that people follow the rules.
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:08.720]   And then you're protected on the outside, you have military things, et cetera.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:15.280]   If those walls are breached by dictatorship or by really stupid grand strategy, our country's
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.720]   come perilously close in the last few years, perilously close.
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:25.880]   If Trump had been president at the time Ukraine was invaded, Ukraine would be no more.
[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:31.200]   We would have Russian armies right up to the Polish border now.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.120]   These things are terribly consequential.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:40.040]   And then another piece is, so you're well-educated and you're in the growing part of the United
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:45.480]   States where you talk to each other at all of these meetings, et cetera.
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:48.360]   Think about organizing things.
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:55.360]   I look at, for instance, we have tremendous problems with refugees or illegal immigrants
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:22:01.180]   coming over our borders because we have basically failing states to the south of us.
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:07.400]   Is there anything that foreign investment or anything could do to help over a 20 or
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:10.400]   30 year period to alleviate this?
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:12.920]   Because it will improve our own national security.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:17.980]   If instead of refugees pouring over our borders, you have people making good t-shirts or eventually
[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:20.560]   putting phones together, et cetera.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.360]   But that's the sort of thing that people who are in your world, who you meet each other
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:28.640]   at these business meetings and talk to each other and think about, okay, I got the here
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:34.120]   and now, but there's also a charity part of it.
[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:38.080]   Maybe my charity work is to me thinking about these other things.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:41.400]   So in my line of work, what do I do for charity?
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:44.160]   I talk to anyone for free.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:47.180]   And I really appreciate that.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:52.560]   On the point about whether enabling democracies or dictatorships, isn't the difficulty that
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.160]   it's so hard to tell in advance?
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:59.720]   I'm sure that Gutenberg didn't think he was helping the Protestant Reformation or that
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:02.840]   the guy who made the radio didn't realize what he was doing for Hitler.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:06.560]   And even with the AI, the thing that it was initially thought, oh, well, it helps you
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:08.960]   collect all this information and congregate it.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:14.480]   But we're seeing that China has been behind on these language models because it's really
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:20.440]   hard to align them to not say anything bad about the PRC or the CCP, rather.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.680]   So I mean, isn't the difficulty that it's hard to tell in advance?
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.080]   It is hard.
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:26.080]   It is hard.
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:31.920]   But the people you're talking about who are your prime audience are the bright people
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:33.720]   have some insights into it.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:36.380]   And I think about, well, what do you want to do in your life?
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:42.040]   I would think one of the pieces would be contributing in some way to make things a little better.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:43.520]   However, you're going to define better.
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:44.520]   Awesome.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.720]   I think that's an excellent place to close this episode.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:50.440]   Thank you so much for your time and really the best military history.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:55.080]   I highly recommend them to better understand not only those periods of history, but broader
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:58.160]   strategies and lessons and insights about our own time.
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.600]   So anyways, this is a huge pleasure.
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.040]   Thank you so much for coming on.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:04.560]   Oh, thank you for having me and asking all the fun questions.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:08.360]   It's been a pleasure.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:13.340]   Regarding some kind of value out of it, I would really appreciate your support.
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:17.800]   As always, the most helpful thing you can do is to share the podcast, send it to people
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.720]   you think might enjoy it, put it in Twitter, your group chats, et cetera, just splits the
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:29.960]   world.
