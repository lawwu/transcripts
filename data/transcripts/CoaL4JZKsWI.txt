[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.720]   .
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.440]   Good morning, everyone! Good morning!
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.960]   I'm excited to be here. I really have one main goal in mind, and that's for this workshop to be
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.360]   interactive. I want it to be fun, and I want you guys to walk away with something tangible.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   So we can actually switch to the slides.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.080]   Slide show. It should be live now. If you guys want to go ahead and go to this link that I have
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.280]   up on the screen or use your phone to go to the QR code, I have some notes for you guys at that URL.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.000]   But those are my stated goals for this workshop. I want to really probably start by
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.760]   asking you guys some questions so I can get some interactions going. But I'm glad you guys came.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.160]   Thank you for coming. I really do appreciate it. The music stuff is something I have been
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.240]   into for a long time, like lifelong musician, artist. But the AI music stuff is something I just started
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.680]   paying attention to. With regard to the tools I'm going to show you today, maybe about a month or so ago.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.520]   So basically what this workshop is going to be about is I'm going to start with the insights that I've
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.760]   gained by doing all the research over the last 30 days, and then we'll get straight into the tools so
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:42.240]   you guys can again walk away with something tangible. Let's start with -- okay, I know it's early, and I'm still
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.080]   groggy myself. So, you know, you don't have to necessarily go crazy here. But by show of hands,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.440]   how many of you have ever used a music generation model, period? Okay, nice. About half you guys. That's dope.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.960]   By show of hands, how many of you guys use -- I had someone in the crowd already say that they used
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.920]   boomy. Have you guys ever used boomy before? No, no, no boomy. Okay, that's your OG if you use boomy
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   because it was from like two years ago. But it was a music generation model that was actually pretty cool,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.440]   but didn't get as complex as the music generation models we have today. How many of you guys have ever
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.680]   used Suno or Udio by show of hands? Okay, nice. Okay, so you guys will be familiar with what I'm going to do
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.560]   today. Hopefully, I can show you guys some like advanced prompting techniques at the least. But for
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   the most part, that's -- those are the tools that we're going to be focused on. I was doing this earlier
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.680]   asking some of the AV crew what you guys favorite artists are. My man here right here in the middle,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.480]   if you could name your favorite artists of all time, what would it be? Who would it be? Yes. Miles Davis.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong because that's a little bit out of my league. Like blues, R&B, jazz.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.920]   Okay. Okay. I think I have something special for you today then. So let's start. I can get into
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.840]   a little bit of what we're going to do as well. And I actually would like to say -- because I've
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.960]   already talked about my workshop goal. What I would actually like to say is that I am not a classically
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.000]   trained musician. I wrote my first song when I was 13. But I welcome any discourse you guys have in
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.720]   terms of like accuracy, right? So if you guys feel like you're actually wrong, like that's cool. I welcome
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.440]   that. And I actually have something for you on that link that I showed earlier where you can submit questions or
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.000]   comments live while we're doing this to either correct me or submit a question or whatever.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.640]   So that was one of the main things I wanted to say. I try to be as accurate as possible. But if I say
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.880]   something wrong, you know, feel free to call me out. I'm comfortable with that. I'm cool with that.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.520]   And actually, let me make sure I have my stuff pulled up.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.920]   If you guys can go to this link, there's a link on there that says poll. If you guys can go fill out that
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.800]   poll. I think there's like two or three questions on there. If you guys could go to that link now and
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.160]   start submitting your answers, I'd really, really appreciate that. Because it -- again, I want this to be
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.760]   really interactive. But I also want to tailor it to specifically what you guys want to know about AI
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   music generation.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.160]   if you guys could make your way over to that link and submit. Would really, really appreciate it.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.400]   Now I've done some housekeeping. I can kind of get into
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.080]   my journey here. I would say I'm way more of a -- first of all, my name is Flo, as you guys may or may
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   not know. I'm way more of a songwriter than like a software engineer. But I have a lot of respect for what
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.200]   you guys do. I know enough Python to be dangerous. But beyond that, I'm not really that good at
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:10.320]   software design or engineering. But I, over the pandemic, took a lot of time out to learn how to
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.440]   write scripts. And I'm really, really big into automation. So I use Python for automation for a lot of
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   myself daily personal life stuff and stuff for work as well. The other thing I would say is I'm really,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.520]   really big into experimentation. Flo is actually my artist's name. And if you go on Google or YouTube
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.160]   or Spotify, Apple Music, you can actually look me up and find my music. But the truth is, I have a very
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:46.320]   eclectic taste. And I, like, have experimented in a lot of different genres. So I -- a couple years ago,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.280]   I decided that I wanted to do some split testing, which is pretty odd for an artist. But I did want
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.800]   to do some split testing. And what I really found out was that the same song under two different artists
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.400]   can behave wildly -- can perform wildly differently. So I literally would take the same recording, like I'm a
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   self-taught engineer, would record at my home or other studios, and upload it under two different
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.120]   artist names. And depending on the cover art, the marketing, who you try and target when you're
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   when you're posting online in terms of the daily content, I would see that songs would perform
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.800]   differently. So what I basically did was start creating these, quote, unquote, pin names and putting
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   out music that way. And I actually have a pin name that has way more streams than my actual artist name.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   So if you look at me as an artist, I don't have that many streams. But I have a couple pin names that
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.960]   have been like viral. I have one that's got like five million streams over the last couple months.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.280]   And it's just instrumental music. So I'm an artist that does like R&B and hip hop. But I've
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.200]   experimented with like EDM. I actually have a song with some like country influence, believe it or not.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.880]   So I've just experimented a lot. And that's kind of how we got here today. I was -- I like to say I was
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.160]   experimenting with multiple genres way before AI music got here. But I love AI music for that reason.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.800]   In this workshop, we'll cover AI music generation and demystifying it. I kind of like distilling
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   better. But you know, TajiBT gave me this word. So I put it in the slides. And we're going to get
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.760]   hands on with Suno and Udio and talk about turning ideas into songs. And then actually, I have a question
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.480]   about this later on. But I really want to talk about opportunities for using AI music. I'm super
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.800]   passionate about like distribution. And for like regular everyday artists to be able to make an
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.520]   income from their music. So if any of you guys are actually artists, like I would love to get into
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:41.840]   those type of discussions. Let's see. Have you guys -- did anybody actually fill out the thing that I
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:51.760]   was asking about? Let's see. Oh, I'm disconnected. Break a leg. Because I really can start throwing in
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:59.120]   little tidbits here and there about what you guys want to learn about. I put what -- like one of the options
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   that I put for the poll is like an advanced option where we can like actually pull down some of the
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.520]   music that Suno is generating, get stems for that music and start to like mix and master. So I don't
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.400]   know if you need -- if any of you guys would actually be interested in that. But I put that as -- yeah.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.440]   Okay. Awesome. Yeah. That was the hardest thing about preparing for this. It's like I just don't know
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.320]   exactly who's going to be in the crowd and what level they're at. So I tried to like come up with a couple
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.400]   different tracks just for this presentation alone. But yeah, I just needed you guys feedback. So nice.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:38.080]   We did get a bunch of submissions. And it looks like prompt techniques. Okay. Tweaking. A lot of
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   prompt techniques. Okay. Cool. I have this guy that I call like the prompt master. How many -- by show of
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   hands, how many of you guys are in the Suno or Udio Discord server? Nobody. Oh, yeah. Oh, you're in there?
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   Okay. Nice. Yeah. Even for you, I think I'll have a treat. Because like there's a couple of people in there
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.080]   that have posted since the beginning of Suno and Udio. And then there's this one guy who's like
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.200]   been able to do some really, really cool like banjo music and bagpipe music that's insane. But the
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.600]   prompts are very unintuitive in my opinion. So you kind of have to see it to, you know, understand what
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.240]   it's doing. So we'll definitely get into that. I'll make sure that I include a lot of prompting stuff.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.640]   Thank you for everyone that just came in. I appreciate you guys joining.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:28.080]   Okay. So this actually gets into -- you might notice that -- you might notice that -- okay.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.640]   It did actually work. But I still might play it from my computer. So
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.400]   this is where we start with the insights that I've learned by studying AI music and how it got to this
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.040]   point over the last couple months. And then I'll get into -- it's kind of painful, but I have to play
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   some videos for you for you guys to catch up to where I'm at in terms of like understanding and how
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.480]   this whole thing developed. So we'll have some videos to watch, but maybe five or six minutes of videos.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:10.080]   when people say AI music, I think that could mean a lot of different things. And when I first started
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.280]   doing my research, it was really frustrating that someone -- everyone meant something slightly different.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   So what I've tried to do is compartmentalize the definitions of AI music and tidy up -- like, I guess,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.840]   really tidy up the definitions. Because there was a lot of, like, blurred lines when I started doing the
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:37.360]   research. And the way that I compartmentalize this was to say that we have text to music, where you're
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:44.160]   generating short samples and full songs using text prompts. You have audio to music. And this is where
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.000]   you're taking an existing sound and transforming it into actual music. And you have, like, style transfer,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.280]   which is basically voice conversion. And voice conversion is actually the first thing that came
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.680]   across when I found AI music last year, actually. So it's been like a long time coming. But I didn't
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.360]   really start doing the research until recently. But I think what most people call AI music is really
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.880]   actually just voice conversion. Well, it's hard to say that now. But maybe when I started doing research,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:21.680]   it was. But I would say that the general consumer, what they call AI music is mostly just style transfer,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.600]   where someone, like, took their voice and converted it to another voice. And that actually gets into the
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.680]   first video. And I'll go ahead and play it now. You guys may have seen this video. It's actually pretty
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:42.240]   pretty cool. Thanks to music.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:50.880]   You might notice that I sound like Kanye West. No, you could we turn it up just a little bit in the
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.640]   house? Because this one's a little bit low. He gets a little louder later, but you'll catch it.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.880]   You might notice that I sound like Kanye West. No, Yeezy didn't record a voiceover for me for
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.600]   this video. I didn't learn how to do impressions. This is AI. So let me come back to my original voice
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.440]   for a second, because this is crazy. Today on Metaverse, I posted AI Kanye covering popular song.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:21.120]   Here's an example of him singing Day Night. So that's clearly crazy. And I started thinking,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.960]   you know, what are the implications of this for the music industry? Now all you have to do is record
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.600]   reference vocals and replace it with a trained model of any musician you like, which is exactly what I
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.480]   did. I found this Kanye style beat on YouTube. I wrote eight bars and I'm going to record them now.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.600]   And then I'm going to have AI Kanye replace me.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.520]   I got a fantasy that's beautiful, that's dark and twisted, but I attacked the whole religion all
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.880]   because of my ignorance. What was I thinking? That was some bitch shit. I lost Adidas, but I'm still Yeezy.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.520]   Back in the kitchen, man, I'm a genius. Boys in the hood, just like I'm easy. Kanye, Weezy,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.000]   South Side of Chicago, life ain't easy. All praise be the Lord, Jesus, Donda, please rest easy.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   All right, let me cut it there, let me cut it there. So let's hear those vocals I just recorded now with Kanye over there.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:11.120]   Yeah. I got a fantasy that's beautiful, that's dark and twisted, but I attacked the whole religion all
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.480]   because of my ignorance. What was I thinking? That was some bitch shit. I lost Adidas, but I'm still Yeezy.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   Back in the kitchen, man, I'm a genius. Boys in the hood, just like I'm easy. Kanye, Weezy, South Side of Chicago,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.880]   life ain't easy. All praise be the Lord, Jesus, Donda, please rest easy. All right, let me cut it there, let me cut it there.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.520]   So you guys kind of get the gist of what he was doing there. But I think a lot of times when we
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.320]   hear AI music, AI music, that's what it is. It's like someone taking the regular songwriting process
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.040]   where you go get production or do the production yourself. You write the lyrics and then record
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.760]   your own vocals. And then what people are calling AI music is really just style transfer or voice
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.240]   conversion where they're taking that voice and turning it into someone else's. So this is actually the
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.920]   first shout out to this guy's name is Roberto Nixon, if I'm not mistaken. And I saw this video and it kind
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.320]   of I think it just definitely changed the trajectory of what I was doing at the time. I dropped everything
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.600]   and was like I have to figure out how the heck he just did this Kanye voice thing. So I pretty much
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.920]   followed the steps in this video. I dove into some discord servers and some subreddits and that's how I
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.640]   really figured out how to do this for myself. So I think that's one compartment that I've kind of like
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:32.160]   created for AI music and put it to the side. The other one -- I have a couple more examples of this as well.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.800]   I think the next one is how many of you guys were familiar -- by show of hands, how many of you guys
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:48.160]   heard that Drake AI song that went viral last year? Okay, we got a couple people. Nice. So I'll play it.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.640]   I don't want to play the whole thing. But again, this is another example of voice conversion. And a lot
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.240]   of people were saying, oh, my God, he pressed a button and generated a whole Drake song. And that's not
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.440]   really the truth. This kid, his name is Ghostwriter, the person behind the song. And he did an interview where
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.600]   he talked about the process of creating the song. And it was all him, except for the actual vocals.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.680]   He like changed his voice to sound like Drake in The Weeknd. I'll play a little bit of it.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.840]   I'm a slave with a knife in my back. What's with that, ay? 21. I love home that my brother, that's my stack, ay?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   Bet you, I made that shit, ay? And I'm a slave with a knife, my back. What's with that, ay? 21. I love home that my brother, that's my stack, ay?
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:48.000]   Bet you, I made the beat, so you know that it's gonna slap, ay? Yeah, it's gonna slap, ay? Tell him, bring it back.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.360]   Talking to a diva, oh yeah, she on my nerves.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.120]   That's actually my favorite part, but I'm gonna cut it off.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:01.040]   Um, so the Drake song was interesting to me because I kind of saw it unravel. Like, I think I found the
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.120]   video or heard the song when it was like under a thousand views, uh, being posted in some of those
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   subreddits that that I was talking about. Uh, but it went super viral. I think he got like nine million
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.360]   streams in the first 24 hours. He was on his way, this guy, uh, Ghostwriter, was on his way to charting,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.320]   of course, before the RIA got ahold of it and was like, we're shutting this down. So he got DMCA'd and
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.920]   the song got wiped from everywhere. Uh, you can still find it on the internet, but it pretty much
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.880]   got wiped from everywhere. And, uh, I just thought like, man, this is really gonna change everything.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.080]   But again, everybody was calling it and saying it was AI music without, uh, being specific about what
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.160]   kind of AI music it was. Um, so I have a couple more videos to show you guys, but I just wanted to go over
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.960]   the Drake one because I thought that was pretty cool. This next one is actually my favorite example of
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.640]   voice conversion that I've seen to date. Let me backtrack a little bit. These two songs that I
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.440]   just played or videos that I just played are from a rough, roughly a year ago. I think March of last
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.040]   year, April of last year. Since then, the voice conversion tools have gotten 10 times better.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   And like when I listened to the Kanye West one back then, it was amazing. It literally blew my mind.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.600]   No, no lie. And today I kind of listened to it and I'm like, wow, it sounds, it's really
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.080]   already facty. It's, it's bad. It doesn't exactly sound like a natural human Kanye West. But today
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.040]   they have stuff that sounds almost exactly, you know, like Kanye West. I think, and I say the kids
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.760]   because when I joined the Discord server is literally a bunch of like 14, 15, 16 year olds doing this,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.720]   uh, these, these conversions. Um, but, uh, the kids have gotten a lot better at like, uh, training,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:37.840]   training, uh, these, um, models, these voice models. Uh, so the next one is actually my favorite, uh,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.600]   example of voice conversion. How many, by show of hands, how many of you guys in here are familiar
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.720]   with Randy Travis? Yeah, I knew I was going to get y'all back there. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. So,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.920]   Randy Travis, uh, and forgive me because I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but he lost his voice
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.800]   some time ago. And, uh, Randy Travis and his team kind of saw this AI thing unraveling or an unfolding
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:08.080]   and decided to sit down, write a song, uh, produce a song, and then use this voice conversion technique
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.480]   for, uh, Randy to sing the song without him actually singing the song. So this is one of my favorite
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:20.960]   examples. I think also in the last year or so, the, the not, maybe temperament is not the best word, but
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.520]   the general public opinion about AI music has shifted a little bit. It hasn't gotten too much
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.680]   better. It's really taboo. Honestly, like I was a little bit, uh, nervous about doing this conference
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.400]   because like people just do not like AI music at all. Don't want it in their lives. But since then,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.200]   this, this Randy Travis song came out a couple of months ago or a couple of weeks ago, I think it was.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:48.960]   And when I looked at the YouTube comments of this video, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.800]   People were like in the comments saying, I'm, I'm a 75 year old man. I'm bawling tears right
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.440]   now listening to this Randy Travis song. Um, like, they were like, I, we don't care how we get Randy.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.560]   As long as we get them back, we'll, we'll take AI or not. You know what I mean? So it's just a really
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   cool example of, I think how voice conversion can be used in the, in the right way, you know,
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:17.440]   by, by the original artists. So I'll go ahead and play some of this as well.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:52.220]   Oh, my God.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:20:11.220]   Hello. Hello. Okay. Sorry. I apologize to the ready Travis fans in the back. I'm going to cut them off a little bit. I do want to keep it going. Even though I'm not super into country music, I thought it was really touching that he was able to get with his team and use AI to create new original music. I thought that was really cool.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   So that pretty much takes care of the style transfer stuff. I've showed you guys some examples. The next thing I want to get into is text to music. And I'll go over full songs as opposed to the short samples that I was talking about.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:42.220]   If you go, again, just want to remind you guys, if you go to the link, aietalk.com/music and send me a question on there, I can see it pop up on my screen. So I can answer it in motion. I also want to repeat it out loud for the transcription and all that good stuff.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:21:09.220]   Okay. So text to music. Text to music. Text to music. I'm going to show you guys a couple examples. I broke text to music down even a little bit further by having -- I have a couple folders here. And I think the way I did text to music was -- yeah, meme songs and samples. Okay. By show of hands, how many of you guys have heard about this Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef going on?
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   Okay. Dang. Okay. Okay. Y'all are up on game. I appreciate y'all. Okay. So, for anyone who hasn't been paying attention, just know that one man said very disparaging words about another man and then the internet ran with it. So I don't have to catch you up on 18 million songs that these men have recorded now. I couldn't even keep up with myself, to be honest with you.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   But yeah, so basically, the internet ran with this whole concept of BBL Drizzy. And Kendrick Lamar said a lyric in one of these songs that they had back and forth over the last couple weeks where he called Drake BBL Drizzy.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:54.220]   I don't want to explain BBL to y'all. I ain't going to lie to you. So hopefully you understand what a BBL is and they call him BBL Drizzy.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:00.220]   And it's funny because, like, it can be taken a couple different ways, but I'll just play the music so I'm not rambling too much.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:27.220]   BBL Drizzy. BBL Drizzy. I'm going in. No diddy. I'm going in. No diddy.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:33.220]   My grandma would probably cuss me out for turning that off early, but I'm going to cut it there.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:40.220]   And basically say that this song was -- to me, this is really what gets to what AI music is.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:47.220]   Because there's a comedian named King Wallonius who logged into Udio, one of the tools I'm going to tell you about, typed in a prompt,
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   typed in some lyrics, if I'm not mistaken, and generated this song. He didn't get in the studio,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:59.220]   he didn't record his vocals, there was no voice conversion, he just typed in some words and got this BBL Drizzy song.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:07.220]   And I think this is like a monumental moment in music as well because it was one of the first times I saw something like this go viral.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:17.220]   And I think -- I mean, we can, if you guys are interested, we can get into some of the legality of AI-generated music and the copyrights around it.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   But I think this moment where he created this BBL Drizzy song in viral, it's been used in a bunch of different songs now, it's like monumental.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:34.220]   But this is text to music, there was no prior recording, he just generated this song, one-shot prompt to a song.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   I think I might have had one more good example for -- I'll play this for a little bit.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   Eleven Labs is another AI startup that has now entered the text to music space, and this is a song that they generated.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:02.220]   Again, no prior recordings, this is just text, music came out the other end and it went viral on Twitter.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   We were having fun, programming young, dreaming that one day we'd make it work.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:31.220]   Lines of code we'd write all night, hoping that one day we'd get it right.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.220]   Can we teach them --
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   Oh, he was about to get into it.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.220]   I cut off a little too early.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.220]   But basically, this is a sort of meta song because it's an AI model singing about GPUs.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.220]   And I thought that was pretty cool.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.220]   But yeah, another text to music song that I would kind of put into the meme song category.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:57.220]   With that being said, I think I had -- oh, yeah.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.220]   So, audio to music.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.220]   These are actually the most interesting examples and also the shortest, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.220]   So, I'll get into some of these.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.220]   These are really cool.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:28.220]   I think the people who are like musicians or artists who have a lot of talent already, like musical talent already are into -- oh, let me play this -- into this style of music generation because it takes an existing sound and --
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.220]   You might notice that I sound like --
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.220]   A new Yeezy track goes --
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   Into another song.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.220]   An existing sound and turned it into music, sorry.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   So, this is using stable audio.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.220]   It's another tool.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.220]   It's not Suno or Udio, but it is called Stable Audio.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:14.220]   And I think this is the first tool I saw that had this feature publicly available where you could put audio in and get a song out or get music out, maybe not a full song.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   But I really like this because I think it unlocks a lot of different ways to create music.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   So, I think that's -- I might have one more example to show you guys.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   This one was cool.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   This is also from the Suno team as opposed to Stable Audio.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   This one is pretty good.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.220]   Nice.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.220]   Okay.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:27:03.220]   So, I thought that was pretty cool because literally all he recorded was his fingers drumming like that on the desk and then out came this full song with the guitar and all these other instruments.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:12.220]   So, you guys kind of get the gist of what audio to audio model generation can be like.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:18.220]   And I want to say with that, we can get directly into actually generating some songs ourselves.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:27.220]   Okay, we can talk about how it works, but you guys didn't really seem so much interested in, like, the technical side when I was looking at the poll.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:37.220]   So, I could briefly touch on it, but I think -- by show of hands, how many of you guys saw that Suno and Udio have been -- are getting sued this week?
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   You guys saw that?
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.220]   The RIAA just filed a complaint against both services.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   So, and what they're alleging is that these AI models are trained on massive music data sets that are copyrighted and we are -- well, not we.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.220]   Don't put me in no indictments.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   I do not want to be -- that's another thing I didn't mention at the beginning, but I have no affiliation to Suno, Udio, Sable Audio, Bumi, no one.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:11.220]   Like, I just liked this stuff and learned it and figured it out and wanted to do a presentation on it.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   But what they're alleging is that Suno and Udio are infringing on their copyrights by training on this music.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:30.220]   Yeah, we had a comment from the audience saying that the last generation sounded like Tom Petty.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   If you are more interested in how these models actually work, the architecture, transformers versus diffusion, I have a link on the page that I mentioned earlier.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   If you click on the notes button and scroll all the way to the bottom, I have compiled a list of all of the music model papers.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   So, if you guys are interested, you can find it there.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   Okay.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   So, what I want to do now as we get into Udio and Suno, there is a lot less people than I thought there was going to be, so this will work well, hopefully.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:12.220]   But there's a business card on the table in front of you, and that business card has a secret code on it.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   This is a little PvP, survival of the fittest, like, may the best man win.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:28.220]   But if you take that secret code, go to the link that I showed earlier, let me put it on the screen again, and click on the gateway button.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.220]   There should be a green gateway button that looks like this.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:38.220]   If you put in that code, what will pop up is a username and a password.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   If you use that username and password to sign into any of these services, let me try and make it a little bigger than that.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:54.220]   If you want to get into Udio, you can use Google, Discord, Twitter, Apple, I have signed up for all the services.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:03.220]   If you want to get into Suno, you can do Discord, Google, or Hotmail, Microsoft, whatever they're calling it nowadays.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.220]   And then you can sign into - so, what I did for this presentation, so you guys could generate music freely,
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.220]   because I know in the show notes for this workshop, I put that you guys should have your own account,
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.220]   but I also thought it would be cool if we could do unlimited generations as opposed to what they give you on the free account.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:24.220]   So, what I did was I signed up and paid for a premiere account for Udio and Suno and gave you guys a login just now.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:33.220]   So, if you go log in, you can generate music as we're talking about the next couple steps.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   Just know that, like, I think 2FA is on Apple, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.220]   So, there might be some difficulty getting in, but just try and get into one of these services, then log into Udio or Suno.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   And the URL for that, I think I have it here, is Udio.com, once you've signed into one of the other authorization services,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.220]   or S-U-N-O.com will get you into one of these sites.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   Worked?
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   Nice.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Awesome.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.220]   We got somebody in.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.220]   Oh, another person.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   Awesome.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   Awesome.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   Awesome.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   Hey, PVP.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.220]   Some of you guys might not make it.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:16.220]   But yeah, I just wanted to do that so you guys had - and actually what I'm going to do as well, when you guys are in your seats generating songs,
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:22.220]   there's another link on this AIETalk.com/music page where it says submissions.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   What I want to do - we might be tight on time - but what I want to do is have everyone who generates songs here in person to submit to this link.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   It's basically just a Google form.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   So you generate some music, take the link - the share link to that music on either service, click on this link here, submissions, and submit your song.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:53.220]   And I think what I'm going to do at the end is just take like a random number generator, and two people will be selected to get access - like keep access to these two accounts that I set up.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   So one of you guys will walk away with like a Suno account, and one of you guys will walk away with an Udio account.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   And like I said, I paid for the premiere.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   I didn't pay for the whole year.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   After they got sued, I was like, yeah, I might not want to invest.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   So I just went ahead and did 30 days.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.220]   Okay.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.220]   So, we can get into some of the techniques.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   While we're on this topic, and you guys are hopefully generating in your seats as well, does anyone here have a birthday this week?
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   Nice!
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   My man, Randy Travis.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   What's your name?
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   Patrick.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   Okay.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   I think what we're going to do is generate a birthday song for Patrick, and I'm going to do that from my account.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.220]   Wait, one more time?
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:50.220]   Patrick, my man.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   Randy Travis.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   Oh, they're going to block that fan.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   And music.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   I'm not even going to try.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:05.220]   There you go.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   Yeah, they just -- I don't know.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:18.220]   Udio may not be as bad about this, but if you put artist names, and obviously now because they're being sued, but if you put artist names, they have a content filter.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.220]   They don't.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.220]   Absolutely.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   I'm going to talk about that as well, like ways to kind of get around the filters.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   But, yeah, that definitely works.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   We had a comment from the audience that basically said, if you like change the spelling up a little bit, and then put like the style of music that the artist is related to, you can skate.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   It's an attorney.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.220]   It's an attorney.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   It's an attorney.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.220]   Oh, shit.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   Oh, you're the one suing Suno and Udia.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   Birthday song for Patrick.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   Let's put in some -- Patrick, what do you like?
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   What kind of music do you like?
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   Which is -- what genre?
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.220]   Rock.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   One more time.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.220]   Rock or Billy.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   Rock or Billy.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.220]   I'm lost.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   Let's go ahead and generate a song from my boy Patrick.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   And then I'm going to take the same prompt.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:56.220]   I'm kind of getting into some of the prompting techniques here, but you guys are able to see this screen, I hope, and see what I'm doing.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   And then we'll play a song.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.220]   Couldn't generate that song description named Randy Travis.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   What about Tandy Ravis?
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   Ravis?
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   Who is Ravis?
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   Listen, brother.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   Just give me my song.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:30.220]   All right.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:35.220]   So, I'm not monologuing the whole time.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   I'm going to go ahead and wrap it up.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   But the way I think of these two different services is that Udia is more like a songwriting partner.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   They have an experimental model that you guys now have access to if you log into that Premiere account that I paid for.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.220]   But the default Udia experience is that you generate 30 seconds of music at a time.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   And you can either extend that idea, remix that idea, or there's a third option I did right here and you can scrap it.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   Because a lot of times, you know, you get weird stuff when you're not great at prompting.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   But you can also use inpainting to modify specific sections of a song.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   Like if you want to change or tweak one or two little things.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   And then now they have this feature within Udia where you can do the audio to audio and it allows you to upload music.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   So, I -- if you are an artist and you write songs or have written a song before or spoken word or anything,
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:38.220]   I would urge you to try to take one of your creations -- especially if you've recorded it, it gets crazy.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:46.220]   If you've recorded some music before, you should take the tempo, the key that that song is in, and your lyrics,
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   and put it into Udia and see what comes out the other end.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   It's blown my mind a couple of times.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:55.220]   I've taken a couple of my own songs and put them in, and it gets crazy what comes out the other side.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.220]   Like, Udia does me better than I do me sometimes.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.220]   Honestly.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:05.220]   So, it's a really cool experience if you have, like, pre-existing music you can really play with Udia a lot.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:11.220]   And then the way that I think about Suno is your in-house music producer.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:19.220]   I like to describe it in a way that I feel like somewhere in the system prompt of Suno's model,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.220]   they have, like, top 40 music in there.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.220]   Because it always comes out really polished and clean.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.220]   And maybe it's the way that the data that they put into the model in the first place.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   But my experience with Suno has been that it just comes out really, really clean.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.220]   Top 40-ish.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.220]   One thing it's gotten really, really good at lately, this is, like, a side note,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   is that when I first -- I personally have onboarded, like, I think a dozen or so people over the last couple of weeks,
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   because I wanted to understand what is the actual use case for these services.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   So, I just started onboarding friends and family, some of my music friends, some people that are not into music at all.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   And what I found when -- a couple of weeks ago was that, like, when I would generate songs,
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.220]   if you're not super specific and counting the syllables in each line of the song,
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:14.220]   when you're getting into the custom mode of Suno, it'll -- the timing of the beat and the artist's, quote unquote,
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   the vocals lyrics gets super off, really, really, really off.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   But they've gotten really good about this lately.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.220]   Like, the last couple of songs I've generated from Suno aren't off.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.220]   They -- the song structure is a lot better, because that's another tip we'll get into.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:34.220]   The song structure really has improved a lot in Suno over the last couple of weeks.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:40.220]   But it's more or less the same, just the outputs are a little bit different from Udiya.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.220]   And now we get into the tutorial.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.220]   So, have you guys -- anyone submitted any songs yet?
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.220]   Let me see.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   Let me recheck.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.220]   I was just generating some music for my boy Patrick.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.220]   We're going to play that in a second.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   But that was the basic tutorial.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.220]   You kind of -- it's about as simple as it gets.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.220]   Like, it really, really lowers the barrier to entry for creating music.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.220]   And I think we can get into some other stuff about -- like, more conversations about that.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:13.220]   But I think for now, I'll just say that it lowers the barrier and makes it easier to create
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   stuff for, you know, specific situations.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220]   Okay, nice.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   We have a couple of submissions.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   We do have a couple of submissions.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   But the gist of it is, you go to Udiya.com, you log in, you go to this -- oh, they used
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.220]   to have -- oh, I guess here at the top, it always says create.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   Then you can type in -- what's another one?
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.220]   The AI Engineer World's Fair.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.220]   Let me start over.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.220]   Let me start over.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:49.520]   A song about the AI Engineer World's Fair.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.220]   And I know the organizer Benjamin Dunphy really likes old school hip-hop.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.220]   Boom bap.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.220]   So, I'll generate a song.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   So, you come in, you type in your prompt, you hit create.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.220]   There's a couple of different options out here.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   Again, if you have a free account, you won't see this experimental, longer song.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   You'll be defaulted to the Udiya 32 model.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:20.220]   But you can come in and write your own lyrics on top of this prompt that you just put in.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.380]   Or you can select to only have an instrumental generated as opposed to a full song with lyrics
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.660]   and everything.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.460]   So at its core, that's how it works.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.140]   For pretty much all these services as well.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.560]   There's not too much beyond that that you need to know to start generating music.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.060]   I would argue that there's a lot more that you need to know if you want to get good at
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:41.640]   it, but that's pretty much how we generate music on both services.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.560]   And what I like to do, just to get a nice even comparison, is use the same exact prompt.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:52.060]   I'll refresh the page, because, like, for some reason, they're really buggy sometimes.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.880]   Where if you generate song after song without refreshing the page, you get, like, extensions
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:06.960]   of songs as opposed to a brand-new song, but I will go ahead and create based on this prompt.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.120]   And then I'm going to come back, because we've now gone over the basic tutorial, I'm going
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.380]   to come back and look at some questions, because I know some questions came in.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.380]   Nice.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:19.940]   And in the meantime, while I'm getting my thoughts together, I'm going to play my song, or the
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.440]   song that was created for Patrick.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.440]   Wishing him a happy birthday.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   Oh, Moderation Air.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.020]   They didn't like your, um, my Randy Travis.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:36.520]   Let's go ahead and play this one, for a little bit.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   It's your day, Patrick, we're singing loud for you.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.520]   Oh, yes, oh, yes, it's true.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   It's your time, Patrick, celebrate the whole day through.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:22.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, happy birthday, ooh yeah, oh we know Patrick, you love that rock and roll,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:31.820]   oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, and country hits, you feel it in your soul, oh yeah, oh yes, oh yeah,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:43.460]   Patrick, what do you think? Patrick said it's the theme song for his sitcom. I'm going to play
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.140]   these other two quick, I just want to hear what they sound like.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   Real quick, if you click on the actual song name, you can see the lyrics on the Suno side.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.280]   I'm going to try the other version.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   I'm going to try the other version, see if, uh, was that more your speed, Patrick? Oh, awesome, okay, all right.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   I'm going to try the other version, see if, uh, was that more your speed, Patrick? Oh, awesome, okay, all right.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Oh, we got five minutes left.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   Let's see what the AI engineer world's fair is on.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   Actually, let's address these questions because we only have a couple of minutes left.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   And then I'll get into the notes real quick because I did want to show you guys some of the prompt
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   stuff.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   The truth is that, like, I have everything under the notes section, like, pretty much everything
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.280]   I talked about today.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   Also, when the recording becomes available, you can come back to the same page, get access
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   to the recording, and then I'll hopefully have the transcript up in, like, an hour.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   Because I recorded it myself.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   But if you come here to this page, aietalk.com/music, and click on the notes section, and you want
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   to not listen to me talk about the prompts, you can find the prompt stuff yourself.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   Not quite all the way at the bottom, but here close to the bottom.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   And this is a GPT prompt, meaning you literally can go to ChatGPT, use this prompt.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   It got a little bit weird.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.280]   Like, for some reason, when I use these closing brackets in GitHub, it, like, basically disappears.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   The whole -- like, you won't even see lyrics anymore.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   But basically, what you can do is -- I think even this would work.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   Like, GPT-4 is now smart enough to do this.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   You can take and you can put in this template and then actually fill in the top here with
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   a song description, and GPT will actually produce some coherent lyrics.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   And it allows for better music generation when you come in with the lyrics as opposed to giving
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   it a general topic and hoping it comes up with good lyrics itself, you can kind of tweak the
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   lyrics yourself before you start to generate.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   So that's the GPT prompt.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.280]   And then for the music model prompts, these are pretty much just examples of what we just
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.280]   did with Patrick and the AI engineer World's Fair song.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   It's just like a general description of a song that you want to hear, that you want to generate,
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   and then it pops out the other end.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   Super pressed for time.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   There are some official Udio and Suno tips that are very useful as well.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   And then here -- I kind of want to get into the prompt master thing, actually.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   Phillip asked, is there a way to do voice transfer of a more generic voice rather than a specific
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   voice, referring to the voice conversion stuff that we talked about earlier?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   And I think the end of that question got cut off.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   Because you said like --
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   Yeah, like --
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   Are you talking about doing voice conversion training -- like training models yourself,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.280]   like going to one of the services or downloading the tools?
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   You literally can just take and blend multiple voices.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   So the way that it works is like you need -- depending on what service or model you're using
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.280]   or what training tool set you're using, you need like minimum six seconds of someone's voice
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   to start training, and you get like a kind of coherent model after that.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   But what you can essentially do is just six seconds of your voice, six seconds of his voice,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   six seconds of Eminem, and it kind of like blends it together.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   Or you can just go to a TTS service and get like an actual like robot voice, like someone -- a voice
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   that doesn't belong to a real person, and then use that to train on.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   So, yeah, for copyright purposes, yeah, you can do that.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   Dang, they got to wrap it up.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   Okay.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   Okay.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   What recommendation do you have to help advocate for the responsible and ethical use of --
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   yeah, sorry about that.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   I don't know why the questions are getting cut off.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.280]   Oh, ethical use of AI music.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   That's a good one.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   I'm going to be honest, I'm going to plead the fifth because I'm not a lawyer.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   I'm going to be completely honest.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.280]   I'm going to be completely honest.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   Oh.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   Good point.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   What tool generates the best cloned voice that can match emotional tone like Kendrick Lamar's
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   Euphoria?
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   Three switches.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   The best cloned voice.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   I would definitely look into RVC.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   You can use RVC in the cloud.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   You don't have to -- like, when you Google RVC, there comes up a bunch of tutorials on how
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   to run it yourself locally.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   You do not have to do that.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   You can run it in the cloud.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   Because you need some decent hardware, like computer hardware to do it.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   But definitely look into RVC.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   It's the best right now.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   Can we have access to the slides?
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   And my time is up shortly.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   Oh, did my thing go to sleep?
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.280]   It did go to sleep.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   Oh.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280]   To log into Udio or Suno?
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   No.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   Really?
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Oh.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   Okay.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   Okay.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   Sorry.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   That's my blunder.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   That was pretty much it.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   Rate your music is something you definitely should check out.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   Like, what someone basically reverse engineered is that these models were trained on labels
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   from rate your music.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   So you can almost reverse engineer exactly what sound you want by going to rate your music,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:54.280]   typing in an artist name, typing in a genre, or really just typing in what you want to hear,
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   and then using whatever labels they put on that music, you put it back into the model itself,
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   like Suno or Udio, stable audio sometimes, I think.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.280]   And you can get very, very close to a specific sound.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   I don't want to say specific artists, but like, yeah, you can get pretty close.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   Yes.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   And I was going to get into, like, the law thing.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   You want me to differentiate between ethics and law, and I understand.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   But I was going to get into it a little bit, but we kind of ran out of time.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   So I apologize for that.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   If you guys would like -- I love to talk about this stuff all day.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   If you want to approach me after the workshop, and we chop it up all day about this stuff,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   I love it.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   And then what I'll do for giving away the accounts, maybe I'll do, like, a live stream
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   or something like that, and grab everybody's e-mail who submitted, because I think we had -- nice,
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   we had 12 submissions.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   Let me refresh.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   I think we had 12 submissions, and I'll pick somebody and just, like, send you guys --
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   I'll change the username and password so everybody can't log into your stuff,
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   and then I'll give you the accounts.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   But yeah, I appreciate you guys for coming.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   I hope you guys got something out of this and walked away with some music,
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   generated some stuff, and I think I'll play a song to go out.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   I'm going to play a song.

[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   I'm going to play a song.

[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   I'm going to play.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   I'm going to play a song.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   I'm going to play a song.
