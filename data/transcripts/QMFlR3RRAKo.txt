[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   What should I do during my rest periods?
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340]   All right.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.800]   Well, first of all, whenever your heart rate is high, the very first thing is to not to
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.680]   suddenly stop.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   Because you want to...
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.040]   There are valve, one-way valves in the veins that whenever you contract the muscles of
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.320]   the legs, they help to milk the blood back through to the heart, so basically they reduce
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.840]   the stress on the heart.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.220]   So just walk it out first, the first step.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.840]   Even if your heart rate was high.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.740]   Then the second thing is you want to do exercises.
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.920]   You want to do relaxation, myorelaxation, muscle relaxation exercise.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   What they are is if you watch boxers, how they, you know, shake off their shoulders
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   and drop their hands and do things like that.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.520]   These exercises go back to the 30s, Soviets used them since the 30s, and they used them
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.640]   with elite athletes, kids in grade schools and everybody.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.200]   So these exercises serve several functions.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.640]   One is if you are doing an exercise that is strength exercise in nature, some of the cross
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.040]   bridges are stuck pretty much.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   And so your muscle is thixotropic, it's like gel.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.760]   So by moving your muscle in a passive manner, you get it unstuck.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.440]   And so you restore circulation obviously.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.560]   And the other reason is, again, control of muscular tension is very, very important.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.280]   It's important to learn how to contract the muscle for strength.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.760]   It's very important how to relax for speed, for endurance, just for a happy life.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.120]   If you look at the best sprinters, note how relaxed their faces are when they run their
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120]   jaws.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.220]   Relaxed, how relaxed their necks are.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.840]   So relaxation is something that's practiced, just like tension.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.100]   So regardless of what exercise that you just did, shaking off, we call this fast and loose
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   drills.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.000]   Shaking like passive, like turn your muscles to fat.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.200]   So you want to do this for a little bit.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   Then after that, it depends how long is your rest.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.680]   So if you're taking, it depends which exactly that you're doing.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880]   In some extreme examples, let's say that you're a sprinter, remember we talked like doing
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.760]   sprint repeats with, let's say, 100 meters in 15 minutes.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.800]   You think, wow, sounds like a great, great training session.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.020]   Well, the problem is these guys do need these 15 minutes to get the acid out of the system
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.820]   and have some other functions to recover.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.420]   But after a couple of minutes, the CNS excitability goes down.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.540]   So what the Soviets figured out back in the '40s still is what you do then after you walked
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.540]   it off, after you shook it off, you here and there, you insert some very kind of like enlightened
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.100]   easy hops or whatever using the same muscle groups.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.180]   So these poor athletes really have a complicated rest protocol.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.220]   There's really no rest for the wicked there.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.500]   If you are a lifter who's taking very long rest periods in between, let's say you take
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.540]   those 10 minutes, then after your heart rate is down and after you shook off and after
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.740]   you walked a little, you can just sit down, you can do whatever you want.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.080]   Do not sit a slouch because obviously, Stu McGill explained why that's not a good idea.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.420]   And speaking of slouching, one reason that runners get their backs jacked up after running
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.300]   or some endurance event is, again, they go into their knees and they get into that collapsed
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.200]   posture and their discs are really pliable and warm after the run and then suddenly put
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.060]   them into flexion and they get messed up.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.740]   So yeah, you also got to, like you point out, to watch your posture, but you really got
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.100]   to watch your posture during recovery because you slump between your sets of squats and
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.580]   then you could blow something out right there.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.580]   - Interesting.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.460]   I used to think that I would have this recurring sort of lower back hip thing that I finally
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.820]   feel is under control and I used to think that it correlated with travel and something
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.780]   about maybe not sleeping as well and traveling perhaps.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.980]   But what I've noticed is even if I just sit too much after training my legs hard, I end
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.680]   up with this back issue.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.700]   So just moving to a standing desk configuration after training legs, irrespective of travel,
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.780]   has really helped.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.060]   And I think, I mean, nowadays there's all this excitement about walking.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.580]   I don't know if you, I don't know how much time you spend on social media, but like walking
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.860]   is the new thing for 2024.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.940]   People discovered walking can lower post-meal blood glucose.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.780]   I mean, all stuff that's intuitive, great thing to do.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.160]   We'll see what happens in 2025, what the new thing is.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.540]   And I'm a fan of walking, but in no small part, because it just feels like it loosens
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.460]   up everything after training and I like to train early in the day if possible.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.700]   And I know it's a dramatic reduction in kind of aches and strains as a function of just
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   adding some muscle.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.940]   - Also the other thing you can do, I remember when I watched your podcast with Stu McGill,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.580]   you mentioned that the upward facing dog, Cobra, Cobra helps you, right?
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.580]   - Yeah.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   - By putting yourself in extension.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.580]   - And hanging into extension, yeah.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.900]   - So for people who, for whom that works, it's, you can just lie on the, lie on the
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.460]   floor in your elbows and just read a book.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.240]   So for example, at Strong First courses, when people do exercise and then we teach them,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.340]   so we have several authorized postures.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.900]   So you either have to sit ramrod straight, you know, you can sit in a Lotus or a Seiza
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.100]   or something like that, or you can, you know, half kneel still upright, or you can lie on
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   your stomach.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.100]   So we do not allow this collapsed posture because this is a great, great way to get
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.100]   hurt.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.780]   Plus, you know, you look like a slacker when you're a slacker, mentally you're not gonna
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.020]   be focused on whatever you're supposed to be doing.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.940]   So I think that's, I think that's a good idea.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.220]   - Yeah.
