[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - This week on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.480]   we're joined by pastor and author Tim Keller.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.600]   He has a really excellent book coming out soon
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.560]   titled Prayer, Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.760]   And he joins us today from his office in New York City
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   to talk about prayer.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   This week, I plan to ask 10 rapid fire questions,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   two questions per episode this week.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.640]   So here we go, Dr. Keller, here's question number one.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.560]   I wanna begin with a broad question.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.680]   Among Christians today, how widespread is prayerlessness
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.360]   and what does it reveal about our spiritual health?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.440]   - Well, I think that's actually, it's a broad question,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.320]   but it's also not that hard a question to answer.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.280]   I know that from a secular,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.120]   just from empirical secular studies,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.840]   everyone in our Western society today has less solitude.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   Everybody says that.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.080]   All of us have, there's less and less of our day
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   or our month or our week in which we are unplugged.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.320]   We're not listening to something
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.920]   or talking to somebody or texting.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.880]   It's because of the, you know,
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.660]   how pervasive social media is and the internet is
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.840]   and various sorts of electronic devices.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.620]   And therefore, most people in the past
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.080]   couldn't avoid solitude to some degree,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680]   but now there isn't any.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.960]   And so everybody I talk to, this is anecdotal,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.400]   everybody I talk to seems so busy
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   and is communicating so incessantly and around the clock
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.960]   that I do think that there's more and more prayerlessness.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   There's less and less time where people go
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.880]   into a solitary time or place to pray, that's all.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.660]   I'm virtually sure that we are more prayerless
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.900]   than we've been in the past,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.440]   and that does say that our spiritual health is in freefall.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.940]   - Sobering.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.980]   All right, on to question number two.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.380]   Your book is very clear.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.620]   A profitable prayer life is impossible without God's word.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.940]   You explain a time in your life
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.500]   when you were driven by desperation to pray,
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.260]   and so you opened up the Psalms and you prayed through them.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.340]   Explain how you did this, what it did to you,
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.940]   what did you learn during the season
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.220]   of going through the Psalms?
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.160]   - Well, that's a, I'm glad to talk about that.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.940]   I came to see that the Psalms were extremely important,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.220]   perhaps for prayer.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.140]   Perhaps that's because I read a book some years ago
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.060]   by Eugene Peterson called "Answering God."
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.660]   He makes a very strong case that we only pray well
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.860]   if we are immersed in the scripture
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.880]   so that we learn our prayer vocabulary
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   the way children learn their vocabulary,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   that is, they're immersed in language
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.360]   and then they speak it back.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.120]   And he said that the prayer book of the Bible
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.080]   is the Psalms and we should be immersed in the Psalms
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.980]   and our prayer life would be immeasurably enriched
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.320]   if we were immersed in the Psalms.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.240]   So that was, I guess, the first step
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.960]   that I realized I needed to do that, but I didn't know how.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   Then I spent a couple of years studying the Psalms.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   At one point, I realized that there were a fair number
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.920]   of the Psalms that seemed repetitious
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.200]   or difficult to understand,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   so I couldn't use them in prayer.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.680]   So I decided to work through all 150 of them
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.160]   and I used Derek Kidner's little Tyndale commentary,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.360]   Alec Mateer's commentary in the New Bible commentary,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.400]   "21st Century," Mateer on the Psalms,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180]   and Michael Wilcock, his commentary on the Psalms
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.960]   in "The Bible Speaks Today."
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.200]   And what I did was I worked through all 150 Psalms
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.760]   and wrote a small outline and a small description
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.240]   of what I thought the Psalm was basically about
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.160]   and key verses that I thought were useful for prayer.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   Every one of these Psalms was a very small paragraph.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.640]   Now, admittedly, I'm using nine-point font,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   but basically it's about, I got all 150 Psalms
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.800]   on about 20 pages, which I use now in the morning
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.680]   whenever I'm praying.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.560]   And by the way, I use the Book of Common Prayers schedule,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   which is I read Psalms in the morning and the evening
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.480]   and then I pray.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.940]   Sometimes I actually pray the Psalm,
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.180]   but many times I just read the Psalm and then pray.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.320]   And I do it morning and evening,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.960]   get through all 150 Psalms every month.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   So that's what I learned and that's what I do now.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.920]   - I love this intentional and disciplined approach.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   And I presume over time you found Peterson's point
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.080]   to be true, that this practice
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.060]   really shaped your prayer language.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.960]   - Yes, that's the reason why you don't just have to,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   you don't have to literally take the Psalm
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   and turn it into a prayer,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.640]   though that can often be very powerful.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.120]   Just reading the Psalms every month all the way through
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.200]   and then praying after reading a Psalm
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   absolutely changes your vocabulary, your language,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.520]   your attitude.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.160]   Tony, on the one hand, the Psalms actually show you
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   that you can be very unhappy in God's presence.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.700]   The Psalms in a sense give you the permission
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   to really pour out your complaints in a way that probably,
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.660]   if it wasn't for the Psalms, we might think inappropriate.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.940]   But on the other hand, the Psalms demand
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.300]   that you bow in the end to the sovereignty of God
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.920]   in a way that modern culture wouldn't lead you to believe.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.540]   So Alec Matier said, "The Psalms are written by people
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.340]   "who knew a lot less about God than we do
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.780]   "and love God a lot more than we do."
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.380]   And by that he meant because they didn't know
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.860]   about the cross, there's a number of places
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.100]   where you could say, "Hey, I don't know as much
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.900]   "about God's saving purposes as I do now
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.220]   "on this side of the cross."
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.860]   But he says, "Even though many of the Psalmists
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.940]   "don't know God as well as we do,
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.060]   "they love God more than we do."
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.180]   So that insight, by the way, also helped me
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.580]   through some of the Psalms
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.820]   where there's calls for vengeance and things.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.500]   - Yeah, so true.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.900]   Thank you, Dr. Keller, for this model.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.540]   I do wanna ask you how a good Calvinist complains to God
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.380]   and I'll ask that later in the week.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.300]   But I have two questions queued up for you tomorrow,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.100]   including how do we discipline ourselves
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.060]   to avoid the digital distractions of our phones
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.420]   when we should be praying?
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.540]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.740]   (upbeat music)
