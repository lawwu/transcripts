[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (Music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Today's question comes to us from a listener named Joshua.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   "Pastor John, hello. As a Christian at the end of my life,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   have I really done all that I could have for Christ
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   if I don't become a martyr for Him? I'm currently working
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   in a skilled trade and by all accounts I'm climbing the ladder of success, so to speak.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   But a few years ago I began to feel that God was calling me into a path that might
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   be deeper and more directly impactful for the Kingdom. I began to feel
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   as though a life spent in the workforce or in corporate America was a waste
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   of time and energy. I have spent several years trying to figure out
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   God's calling on my life so far to no avail.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   My question is this. If I spend my life in a career that does not
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   have the direct mission of spreading the gospel, isn't
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   that wasteful? Why would God place me in a job that isn't
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   involved in expanding His Kingdom, but rather consumes my energy and material
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   production? And more directly, have I truly done
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   everything, used every ounce of strength, given every fiber of my being
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   to the Kingdom of God, if I don't become a
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   martyr for Christ?" Pastor John, what would you say to
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Joshua? I have three
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   cautions for Joshua, and then a couple
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   of interpretations. The first caution is,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I think it is invalid to persuade
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   yourself to leave a job and enter
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   a new ministry if the argument
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   that you use to persuade yourself necessarily
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   puts other obedient people in the category
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   of disobedient. Let me try to explain. Joshua says,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   "I began to feel as though a life spent in the workforce
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   or corporate America was a waste of time and energy."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then he says, "If I spend my life in a career that
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   does not have the direct mission of spreading the gospel, isn't that
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   wasteful?" So my counter question is,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   does Joshua believe that all
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   other Christians who spend their life
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   in the workforce or corporate America, or who spend their career
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   in tasks that are not the direct
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   mission of spreading the gospel, are those people
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   living in disobedience? Is that the implication
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   of the argument that Joshua is using
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to persuade himself that he doesn't belong there?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now, if it is, then there are two possibilities.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   One, no Christian should work in the ordinary marketplace,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   or two, the argument that Joshua is using
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   to leave is invalid. As I read the New Testament,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   it is clear that the apostles do not intend
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   that all Christians should leave their ordinary employment. The principle
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   that Paul follows in 1 Corinthians 7.20 is
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   each one should remain in the condition in which he was called, that he's called
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   to be a Christian. Or, verse 24, "So, brothers, in whatever
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   condition each of you was called, let him remain with God."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now, "with God" changes everything. It's not as though the
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   apostles don't want there to be radical change in your life and in the way you
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   relate to people and your job, but you don't have to leave your job in order to be a faithful
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Christian according to those principles. So that's my first caution.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   If, Joshua, you are going to leave your job
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   to be sure that the reason
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   you are leaving it does not put other people who
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   don't leave in the position of being disobedient, because that would be
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   an invalid reason, since God does not intend for everybody
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   to leave. Second caution. Joshua is clearly concerned
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   that he not come to the end of his life and have to
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   admit, "I didn't truly do everything, use every
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   ounce of strength, give every fiber of my being to the
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   kingdom of God." Well, that's a worthy aspiration.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And here's the caution. It is possible
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   to be a missionary, living in an extremely risky
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   place, and be killed by Christian haters
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   even though you, in fact, were not
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   doing everything you could, were not using every ounce
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   of your strength that you had, and were not using every fiber
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   of your being in devotion to Jesus, but were, in fact, wasting a lot
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   of time acting in a worldly way with great timidity
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and caring very little about the people around you. That's possible.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That happens. Missionaries can become like that. And
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   conversely, it is possible to be working in corporate
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   America and be using more of your strength, more fibers
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of your being, more ounces of your strength for the sake
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   of the kingdom than if you were a missionary. In other words, there
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   is no necessary correlation between
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   where you work and what your assigned task is
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   on the one hand, and your wholehearted devotion to Christ or the fruitfulness
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   of his kingdom on the other hand. So be careful
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   that you don't assume that a change
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   of location or a change of vocation
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   will mean that you are more devoted to Christ
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   or more effective in winning lost people
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and more fruitful in glorifying the king. That's caution
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   number two. Here's a third caution. Keep in mind
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   that aiming to be a martyr is turning
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   a God-decided result of faithfulness
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   into a self-decided definition of faithfulness.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You shouldn't do that. It may be that the path of obedience
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that God assigns to you will end in martyrdom.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   That's not your call. God's calling on our
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   life is obedience and faithfulness and love and zeal.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   How it ends is his business, not ours.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And remember, many have been martyred
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   who were weak and worldly Christians, who happened
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And many
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   have died natural deaths who were
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   vastly more fruitful and effective Christians
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   than some martyrs. There is no
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   necessary correlation between the fruitfulness of your life
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and whether someone kills you or not.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Now, those are my three cautions. Here are my two
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   exhortations. It is certainly true
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   that God has mysteriously,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   wonderfully led thousands of people to leave ordinary
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   jobs in their homeland in order to move them
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   onto frontline missionary work.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And in most cases, part of God's strategy
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   is to give people a sense of restlessness
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and a desire for something closer to
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   an unreached place or an unreached people or a
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   hands-on gospel ministry in the church.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   That restlessness is not the only means God uses
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   to lead people, but it is often part of it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   It certainly was part of it for me when I left one calling
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   for another. And this restlessness is not
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   an indictment of the other people who don't feel it.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So I'm not telling Joshua to be quiet and stay
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   where he is. Maybe not. This may indeed
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   be God's moving in his life, which leads
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   then to the last exhortation. Joshua says, "I have
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   spent several years trying to figure out what that path looks like
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that God is calling me to so far to no avail."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Now, I don't know Joshua. I don't know his situation,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   his relationships, his church affiliation, his maturity,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   his gifts. I'm in no position to tell him what to
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   do specifically with his life. But if he
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   means when he says, "I have spent several years trying to
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   figure this out," if he means that he's been trying to figure it out
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   alone in himself, between him and God, then
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   probably what is needed is that he be more
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   fully embedded in a fellowship of believers
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   where other people can discern his gifts and his
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   passions and his maturity, and in that way
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   confirm for him God's call on his life.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That's the way it ought to happen ordinarily. Not an
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   isolated person trying to figure out the emotional state of their own
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   soul or God's call on their life, but a member of a
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   body of Christ using his gifts in
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   relationship to other people and then discovering from
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   the fruitfulness of his labors what he's
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   effective at and what he loves to do and what others
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   give him affirmation in doing. So my answer to Joshua's
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   question is, whether you become a martyr or not
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   will not be the evidence of whether you have spent your
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   life fully devoted to Jesus or wasted it. That's
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   not the test. And whether you should leave your present
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   job and go into vocational gospel
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   ministry is something you will most wisely discern
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   in a Bible-saturated body of believers.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for the question, Joshua, and thanks for joining
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   us today on the podcast. For our feed, our archive, or to send
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   us a question of your own, go online to DesiringGod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Well, speaking of optimizing our lives for good,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   on the other side of the weekend, we are going to ask, "How do I glorify
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   God in the little day-by-day things that fill my life
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   up?" It's a really important question we all must resolve.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   How do I glorify God in the little day-by-day things?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Monday.
