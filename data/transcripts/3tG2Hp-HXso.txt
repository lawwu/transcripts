[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   We're back one last time with Dr. John Frame on the podcast.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.480]   He's the author of A History of Western Philosophy and Theology, an outstanding new book that
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.800]   releases in mid-November from PNR.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.520]   Of course, Christians are not the only people who know things.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.920]   Non-Christians know a lot of truth about this world and about how it works and operates.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.200]   All knowledge is in some way a revelation of God, of course.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.040]   As we talked about yesterday.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.120]   But it seems that non-Christians can even perceive at some level what is true and good
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   and beautiful.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.480]   Yet, the Bible also makes it clear that unbelievers suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.520]   That's Romans 1, of course.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.480]   So Dr. Frame, how would you describe the truth that unbelievers grasp?
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.840]   And what do you mean when you say that non-Christian thought vacillates between rationalism and
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   irrationalism?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.720]   Well, that's very difficult to describe, Tony.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.800]   People much wiser than me have tried to do that and found it really beyond their ability
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   to state clearly.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.800]   Romans 1 is the clearest passage in Scripture that tells us about the unbelievers' knowledge.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   It tells us that God's glory is clearly revealed so that non-believers, pagans, as he's writing
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   about in Romans 1, pagans have a clear knowledge of God.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.200]   In fact, in verse 21 it even says that these pagans know God.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.320]   They don't just know about God, but they know God.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.360]   So they're not ignorant.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.920]   What they need is not additional information, in a way.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.440]   Now, in a conversation between a believer and a non-believer, sometimes there's an exchange
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.440]   of information.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.880]   If the non-believer claims not to know something, we have to remedy that claim, at least.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.320]   But in the most profound sense, the non-believer knows God, even though he rejects God.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.400]   Now, Paul goes on to say in Romans 1 that as the non-believer suppresses the truth in
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.360]   unrighteousness, he exchanges—this is unbelievable if you know the glory of God—but he exchanges
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.520]   the glory of God for the glory of things in the created world, and makes statues and images
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.640]   and worships these idols instead of worshiping the true God.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.560]   And then Paul goes on to show how that naturally leads to very gross sins in the area of sexuality,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.200]   and then toward the end of the passage he gives a very long list of different kinds
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   of sins that all arise out of the suppression of the truth, exchanging the truth for a lie,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.600]   as he puts it.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   What does that mean?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.400]   What is it like to know God that clearly and yet to be suppressing that knowledge of God?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.480]   Well, you know, psychologists have ideas about the subconscious and how people sometimes
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   repress the truth into a part of their conscience that they're not entirely aware of themselves.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.040]   We're often mysteries to our own selves; we can't understand ourselves in many ways.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.280]   Practically, I don't know if that's a good description, because the Bible doesn't give
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.000]   me a precise description of what takes place.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.240]   But practically, I think what happens is that when you're talking with a non-believer, you
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.440]   can agree on things like the sky is blue, and this is an evergreen tree, and it's not
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.480]   a pumpkin, so you can agree on ordinary things, but the closer you get to talking about God,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.200]   the closer you get to talking about Jesus Christ, the more disagreements come in, and
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.720]   the more fervent the disagreements are.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   And so you really have to—it's a paradoxical situation, and the unbeliever is always pushed
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   back and forth.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.880]   He lives in God's world, so he has to acknowledge certain things about God's world.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   When you jump up in the air, you fall back down again, and if you ignore that knowledge,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.440]   then you won't live very long.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.560]   He has to acknowledge certain things, and yet he tries so very hard to squeeze God out
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   of his knowledge.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.600]   I think of Satan, for example, as the worst possible example along this line.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.000]   Satan, in one way, knows more about God than I do or than any of us do, but Satan tries
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.360]   the terrible project of trying to replace God on the throne, and it's just laughable
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.440]   that anybody would try that.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.040]   But essentially, that's what Satan tried to do, and that's what unbelievers try to do.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   Now I say that's a pretty good description of irrationalism from a philosophical standpoint.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:39.400]   When they do that, that's really a repudiation of reason, because a reasonable person doesn't
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   turn away from what is clearly evident in his eyes.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.800]   But the nonbeliever, therefore, is an irrationalist.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.880]   But why is he an irrationalist?
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.920]   He's an irrationalist because he wants to be the lord of his mind.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.400]   He wants to be the final authority for what is true and what is false.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   He wants to rule his own thoughts rather than thinking God's thoughts after him.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.920]   Well, that's a pretty good philosophical description of rationalism.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.440]   A rationalist is somebody who trusts his own reason as the final and ultimate standard
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   of truth.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.120]   Well, here I am, I've said that the unbeliever is an irrationalist, and I've also said that
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   he's a rationalist.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.880]   Well, which one is he?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.400]   Well, the fact is that he bounces back and forth.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.800]   The desire of his heart is to be irrational, but when he gets into trouble that way, when
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.440]   he finds out that he's living in God's world and he can't behave that way, then he tries
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.400]   to set up some kind of an orderly type of thought based on his own reason, and that
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.960]   doesn't work either.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.040]   But when that gets him into trouble, then he jumps over into irrationalism.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.320]   And Tony, I think that's a pretty good guide to the way the history of philosophy progresses.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:16.200]   You know, you have one generation of philosophers like skeptics in ancient Greece, and they
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.480]   take an irrationalist, relativist kind of view.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.080]   And then another group of philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, for example, come along
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:35.520]   and try to show that reason is reliable and reason is dependable.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.760]   And then you have another generation that questions Plato's assurances.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.920]   And so the history of philosophy tends to move from rationalism to irrationalism, and
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.200]   some philosophers, of course, try to come up with combinations of the two, which are
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.680]   always unstable.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:09.800]   So I think that's the most helpful way I know to describe the unbeliever's mentality, but
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.840]   it's paradoxical, it's difficult to understand.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.600]   In fact, it's impossible to understand consistently because it isn't consistent.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.920]   That's fascinating and true.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:28.600]   So let's make this concrete and put this distinction into a context of non-Christian novelists.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.960]   It seems like in the best non-Christian fiction, authors grasp some sense of what is true and
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.440]   good and beautiful, like the beauty of self-sacrificing love.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.840]   It's beautiful to give your life for others.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.080]   And they also understand the human condition in some really authentic and profound ways
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.440]   too.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.920]   Years ago, I remember reading an article of yours and you said something to the effect
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.960]   that no one can suppress all the truth all the time.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   And for me, that was illuminating.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.400]   That was really helpful.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.880]   And the image that I have in my mind is that truth is everywhere in creation and being
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.800]   in this world is like being in a pool and truth is like being surrounded by a hundred
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   ping pong balls.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.220]   And the suppression of truth is like trying to hold down a hundred ping pong balls underwater
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.220]   at all times.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.280]   It's just impossible.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.760]   Does that illustration work for understanding non-Christian novelists and their perceptions?
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.400]   Oh, that's a great illustration, yeah.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:33.760]   Well, I appreciate the novelist tradition because often what they come up with and it's
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:41.720]   not surprising, but what they often come up with are stories and images that are analogous
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.160]   to the story of redemption in the Bible.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.560]   That's because I think everybody knows in his heart that what we need as human beings
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.320]   is redemption from sin.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.920]   What we need above all is not more food, more entertainment, more goodies, but what we need
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.160]   is forgiveness.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   And so they write stories that allow for that and which picture that in various ways, but
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.680]   most of the time they don't tell anywhere near the whole story.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.640]   Yes, exactly.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   Tragically true.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.400]   And in some sense novelists can speak to what they know is true, but they don't have to
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.540]   embrace it as true personally maybe.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   Is that going on?
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.840]   So perhaps in a novel more ping pong balls get to the surface.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:41.160]   And of course when you're writing a novel, you maintain some distance from the characters
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:47.640]   and from the things that you're writing about so that you're writing something that you
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.720]   don't need to urge on anybody else.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.040]   You don't need to preach.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   You don't need to make a claim that it's true.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.560]   You just sort of pretend that you can look at it objectively from the outside.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   Bingo.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   That's gold.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   Thank you, Dr. Frame.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.440]   I appreciate your time in these past two days.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   Thank you, Tony.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   I've enjoyed being with you.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.040]   That has been Dr. John M. Frame, the J.D. Trimble Professor of Systematic Theology and
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.440]   Philosophy at Reform Theological Seminary in Orlando, filling in for John Piper, who
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   returns tomorrow.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   Thank you, John.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680]   Thank you, Tony.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:22.680]   Thank you.
