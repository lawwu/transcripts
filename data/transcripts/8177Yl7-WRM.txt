[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.820]   There's one gender that has to endure a whole lot of grossly exaggerated hyperbolic accusations of unfairness, and another gender that gets to make those accusations.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.040]   And the gender that has to endure the unfair accusations is men, and the gender that gets to make them is women.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:24.080]   Obviously, not all women make them, not all men receive them, but still, if we're talking about the average fairness of the treatment of men and women in our society,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.540]   I say that this climate of false accusation and intimidation is what really tips it.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.080]   It didn't have to be this way, Dorkash, right?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.760]   We could have just had conditions change without a whole lot of flinging of wildly inaccurate accusations, but that's not the world we're in.
