[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   How much of the guidance you see people sharing
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.020]   is misleading or just completely wrong?
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.480]   - A lot of the advice and guidance that one gets,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.100]   particularly on the internet, but in general,
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.600]   comes with a, if you don't do this,
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.840]   terrible outcome X will happen.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920]   If you don't breastfeed, your child will be a loser.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400]   If you co-sleep, your child will die.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.560]   If you don't co-sleep, your child will never love you.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.980]   The thing that's on the other end of it
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.840]   is a kind of devastating outcome in some way.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.240]   And the reality is very few of our parenting choices
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   have any impact anywhere near that important.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.720]   Maybe that isn't very nice to hear,
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.040]   but for the most part, many of the choices we make
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.640]   aren't really gonna matter very much in the end
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.560]   based on the data.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.480]   And most of the time, there isn't a particularly correct way
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.680]   and any choice you make is unlikely to matter
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.000]   that much in the long run.
