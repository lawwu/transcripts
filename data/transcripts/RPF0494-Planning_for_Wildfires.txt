[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.940]   Men and Clothes. Today's question comes in from Aaron in California. Hi, Joshua. I love
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.600]   listening to your podcast. I know you've had a few episodes recently in reaction to current
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.100]   events. As a resident of the Bay Area, I hope you could do an episode in relation to wildfires.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:28.900]   Well, Erica, I'll give it a crack. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.400]   to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.660]   a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.740]   less. Today we will tackle this wildfire topic. I'll do the best that I can with the goal
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.500]   of helping you to preserve your life, your property, and the life and property of others.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:02.420]   If you're anything like me, I would imagine that you have watched with great interest
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.180]   and fascination at the events of the California wildfires of the past few days. Certainly
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.440]   extremely, extremely destructive. Just to watch the fire spreading all throughout parts
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.380]   of California. Many, many fires and the stories that are coming out are just incredible. The
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.020]   videos that are coming out in our modern era are really, really stunning. Really, really
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.620]   stunning. If you're interested, I've just shared a number of ones that I found on my
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.980]   Twitter feed, twitter.com/joshuasheats. You can go and find some curated links there to
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.060]   videos of people who've been interacting with these wildfires.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.500]   So in the course of today's show, I'm going to try to give you some helpful ideas and
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.340]   suggestions that will be broadly applicable. There are a lot of factors that would deeply
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.500]   affect your experience with a wildfire. Big difference between being part of a suburb
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.140]   versus being out in a rural area. But I think that there are some lessons that all of us
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.420]   could learn from watching the news and reading about some of the stories because in some
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.980]   ways disasters are unique and wildfires are certainly unique. Get to that in a moment.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.020]   But in some ways disasters are common. There are many parallels between some of the things
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.260]   I've done shows on in past days, preparing for a flood or preparing for a hurricane.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.700]   In many ways, these things have parallels. When you boil it all down in the end, basically
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.340]   you're trying to make sure that you ensure physical safety for lives. That's the most
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.380]   important thing. Ensure physical safety for you and for your family, your loved ones,
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.860]   your pets, and then to ensure physical safety for property whenever possible. And so we
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.180]   can take mitigation plans and do our best to protect our property. There are different
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.060]   techniques that we can use to protect property. And then if we suffer the loss of property,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.340]   then we want to make sure that we attend to the human needs, the human comforts, and that
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.380]   we attend to figuring out the best way to get the property reestablished. I mean that's
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.900]   basically the function and flow of it. And in that way, all disasters are common. Most
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.220]   of the time, you're going to stay put right where you are unless the disaster will cause
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.860]   you to be unsafe where you are. And then your number one goal is to get out. You want to
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.260]   make sure that you get out with the supplies, as many supplies as possible to sustain you
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.980]   and your family in as much comfort as possible and as much safety as possible. And then you
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.420]   want to protect your property to the greatest degree possible. Sometimes that means loading
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.140]   the property up and getting it out of the danger zone. Sometimes that just means putting
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.420]   things in place to protect it from an inundation with a flood or a fire, et cetera.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.000]   So in that way, we can learn some lessons. And then I'll try to share some other things
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.760]   that are specific to fires. Now, wildfires are very different or are different in many
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.980]   ways than home fires. I've done quite a bit of thinking and research around home fire
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.800]   safety and I believe that it's an important area of focus for us. There are very few disasters
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.000]   more devastating than a complete and total destructive fire, whether that's a home fire,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.920]   somebody dropped a cigarette in their bed and lit the bed, lit the house on fire or
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.600]   cooking fire or something that spread, or whether it was the cause of a wildfire. You
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   look at a house that has been burned down and it's very easy for everything to be lost.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.040]   And then whatever does remain sometimes is just so inundated with smoke that it's destroyed.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.840]   It's very common. Even if I think of the second most catastrophic or the third most catastrophic
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.760]   thing, something like a tornado would be a very catastrophic natural disaster. But oftentimes
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.520]   you may have things in the basement that will survive the tornado or maybe you have things
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.680]   that are in a safe that will survive the tornado. Well, the fire doesn't discriminate. You've
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.800]   got a long and hot fire and your fireproof safe doesn't do any good. When the fire is
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.320]   long enough and hot enough, it'll destroy everything inside of it, no matter how good
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.280]   your safe is. If there are no firefighters coming who can put the fire out in an hour
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.840]   or two, even the best of fireproof safes will give way and the contents will be destroyed.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.560]   Even something like a flood, floods are devastating because they can really ruin everything. But
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   in many ways, if the first floor of your house floods, maybe there are still items on the
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   second floor that are okay. Or maybe the flood inundation comes in slowly enough that you
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.440]   can take your property and move it to higher ground or put it into plastic Tupperware containers.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.000]   Of course, I'm being optimistic, but just demonstrating the point that I can't think
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.240]   of anything more destructive than a fire. And then the speed with which a fire comes
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:57.800]   is especially destructive. If you're dealing with a home fire, something that just happened,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.400]   electrical wire shorted out in the attic and caught the insulation on fire, you got to
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.160]   get out. And so it's a matter of, we got to go. And these wildfires, one of the most awful
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.400]   things about the current wildfires has been the speed with which they have spread. Headline
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.060]   from Monday, October 16, 2017, Wall Street Journal put it this way, "Wildfire victims
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.560]   had only seconds to make choices." Sub headline, "California's deadliest blazes advanced
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   100 yards every three seconds." That is incredible. I mean, you put yourself in a situation like
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:43.160]   that, from end zone to end zone on a football field in three seconds. Things are moving
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.360]   fast. Understatement of the day right there. We're going to save the topic of home fires
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   for another occasion today, talk about wildfires. And one quick caveat for you, I have no personal
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   experience in dealing with wildfires. I've had an interest in it, especially since watching
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.120]   the devastation of the Fort McMurray wildfires last summer up in Canada. And so I've taken
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.680]   an interest in studying the subject. But if I get anything wrong, if there's anything
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.960]   that you observe from those of you who are in fire country that I got wrong, please correct
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.800]   me on it. But I think that I've got – I wouldn't be recording the show if I didn't
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.980]   believe that I have some useful ideas and commentary to make that will help you, even
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:29.120]   due to my own personal lack of experience. Thing one, get out. Now, we've talked about
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.200]   this and it's complicated in a wildfire. But one of the most valuable aspects of preparedness
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.040]   that you can make for yourself is make a plan to get out of the danger zone, to get out
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.920]   of the problem area. If you can simply physically not be where problems are, you'll have a
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.080]   much easier time surviving personally and the care for your life and the life of those
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.840]   you love is the most important thing. And you'll have a much easier time recovering.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.520]   It's very hard to recover from a disaster when you've gone through it. It's much easier
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.760]   to come in on the other side when – and try to pick up the pieces than it is to make
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.260]   it through and then try to pick up the pieces. And so your goal is if there's a problem,
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:16.440]   to get out early and not be one of those who films a video that becomes famous on YouTube.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:25.980]   Now, this is complicated by the way that wildland fires work. Many people may live on the perimeter
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:34.800]   of a wildfire and they may live in a state of uncertainty for many weeks. Wildfires seem
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.420]   to have – sometimes they have an ability to contain them but then sometimes a quick
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.160]   change in the weather may make all of the difference. And so I'm not pretending that
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.960]   the simplistic advice of get out and be fine with being gone for all of fire season, it
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   just doesn't work. But it is important that you pay careful attention and if you see danger
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.320]   or you see prospective danger, start making preparations to get out.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.680]   When people are living in a zone of danger like a wildfire all around that may affect
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.320]   their community, different people have different responses. But the best response for you is
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.560]   at the very least to do planning and preparation. Now, it may not be appropriate for you to
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.880]   evacuate two weeks – for two weeks. That may not be doable. That may not be appropriate.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.200]   But at least you can go ahead and make preparation. One thing that all of us need to have prepared
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.680]   at all times is an evacuation checklist. We've thought through some of the biggest decisions
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.880]   in advance. For example, many people are flummoxed when faced with the need to evacuate from
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.760]   their home to their own safety. They don't know what to take with them. So it's good
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.480]   and important for us to have a list of what are we going to take with us. If you have
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   family members, husband, wife, children, you want to make sure that that list of things
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:56.120]   to take with us when possible is divided by who can load this up, who can get these certain
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.080]   things, so we don't miss something important. How are we going to get out? Do we have a
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.320]   car? Do we have a van? Do we have a trailer? How much stuff can we get out? Many people,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.400]   if you're facing fire, you should seriously consider which items are going to be the most
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.980]   important if my house burns down and can I get them out of here physically. If you're
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.040]   leaving at the last moment and you've got a small car to get into, you're not going
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.000]   to get much out. But if you've got time, perhaps it'd be worth it to load up a couple of things
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.760]   that are larger but very valuable to you. Where will you go and what route will you
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.160]   take to get there? This needs to be thought of in advance. In a previous show, I talked
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.960]   about looking at a map and choosing directions and a few places to go in all four cardinal
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.600]   directions. You can't choose which direction a fire is going to come from, although you
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.080]   can study in advance and understand the likely movement of the fire based upon the wind patterns
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.040]   and the changes in terrain. But you can't choose which direction it's certainly going
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.000]   to come from and the wind may change. And so you need to have potential destinations
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.400]   to go and stay with friends or families or at the very least to have a destination of
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.040]   a hotel in all four directions. So if you choose a hotel that's an hour and then maybe
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   one that's two or three hours away from your house in all four directions, just choose
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.760]   a reasonable hotel and then have a goal of having that hotel's phone number written down
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.880]   so that you can quickly call and make a reservation. That's very helpful so that you have an idea
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.560]   and a destination. So in a situation like this, when someone has thought through in
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.280]   advance, "If I need to go, what do I need to take with me? How are we going to gather
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.600]   these things together? How are we going to leave? And what are some of the routes and
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.680]   where will we go?" If you've thought through some of these big questions, then you're
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.040]   not going to be caught so flat-footed when the disaster comes. And you can look at it
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.500]   and make your assessments at the time and not be quite so worried about it.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.400]   You should maintain for yourself a checklist of the most important things. And ideally,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:02.520]   these important things should always be kept in a central location where you know, "I
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.260]   can grab all of these things quickly." It's one thing to have a week or two weeks of warning
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.560]   on a fire. It's another thing to be awakened by a fireman banging on the door saying, "You
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:20.120]   got to get out now." I recommend that you keep either possibly a file system, a foldering
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.720]   system, a bag of some kind handy where you can quickly and easily make sure that you
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.680]   have everything that's important, your cash, cash reserves, currency reserves, checkbooks,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:39.640]   banking information, credit cards, the backups of your computer files and hard drives, all
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.800]   of your proofs of insurance, your insurance paperwork, your deeds to your house, anything
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.880]   to keep your phones going and other things like that. And then all the physical things
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.640]   that you need, prescription medications, everything loaded up, eyeglasses for those of you who
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.200]   wear eyeglasses. Make sure that you have all of those things prepared and planned and that
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.360]   you have, that you keep a list of them at the very least, a list so that you can gather
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.960]   them quickly. And don't waste the time of preparation. If there's a fire coming and
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.840]   you haven't done that, then go ahead and get those things together.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.200]   Once you have those most essential things gathered, if you're facing danger and you
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.560]   have advance warning, go ahead and get together the most important things, the mementos, the
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   things that aren't going to sustain your life but that you'd be devastated to lose and pack
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.920]   them up, pack the car. Much easier to pack the car and have it all loaded up and then
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.680]   have to unpack it than to have to hit the road without those important things and come
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.840]   back to a flattened house.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.240]   Now, in just a moment, I'll talk about planning for having to get out in a hurry when you've
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.280]   got 30 or 60 or 90 seconds of warning, when you got to go right away and what to do to
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.640]   be prepared for that.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.920]   Before I do though, brand new advertiser I want to introduce you to on today's show,
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.760]   which is Bombfell. Bombfell, again, brand new here to Radical Personal Finance. And
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.280]   just a few weeks ago, I finished my first shipment with Bombfell. Basically, what Bombfell
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:10.360]   works to do is to make it easier for men to connect with a personal stylist who will work
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.800]   with them to help them choose clothes that will be great for them.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   Personally, I think that the way we dress is very important in our personal life and
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.080]   in our business life. We can all say that it shouldn't matter what you wear. Well, that's
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.600]   all well and good to think that. The problem is it does matter what you wear. Over the
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.800]   years, I had a couple of people who – a couple of men who just struggling to find
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.280]   and attract a wife and I said, "You ready for some help? Let's start by taking you
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.360]   clothes shopping." It's important. The same thing in the business world. The way
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.240]   that you dress is going to affect how you're perceived.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.440]   But if you're anything like me, it's hard to always feel like, "Okay, I'm going
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.080]   to go out and go shopping." It's hard to know where to go to get things. Many of us
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   don't really enjoy the in-store experience. Bombfell is a way to get better clothes and
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   to get help with buying clothes. One of the things that makes Bombfell unique is that
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.720]   they assign to you a stylist and you fill out on their website when you first sign up.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.200]   You fill out things about your measurements, your weight and all of that. Then a stylist
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.880]   will work with you and start to send you selections. They'll start to send you ideas and then
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.560]   you choose which ideas you like, clothing ideas you like and which you don't. Then
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.880]   if you get the things that you like, then they ship it out to you. No charge for the
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   shipping. They ship you the clothes. You get to try it all on. You have seven days to try
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:41.520]   it on in your home. If you like the clothes, you keep them and you pay the price that's
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.920]   listed on the price sheet. If you don't like the clothes, you just ship them back.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.400]   You have, again, seven days to wear the clothes without any charge. Shipping is free both
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.320]   ways. There's very little risk involved if you don't like the clothes.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.480]   When I went through the initial Bombfell sign-up process, I had to laugh at some of the style
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.920]   suggestions. For example, they could send coats. I thought to myself, "I don't wear
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.720]   coats." I was able to not have them send me any coats. Or they had a choice to see if
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.960]   you liked graphic designer t-shirts. "I don't wear t-shirts." I was able to skip that.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.160]   But I was able to choose the types of clothes that were right for me. They sent me this
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.240]   really nice pair of khaki shorts and a really nice blue shirt. The most surprising thing
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.560]   to me was they got my size right the first time. I'm kind of a hard guy to fit. I'm
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.160]   pretty large. But they did a great job. I really enjoyed the outfit that they sent me.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.200]   So if you're interested in an easy and valuable way to increase your wardrobe, I've negotiated
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.840]   for you a discount on your first purchase. Save you $25 at Christmas. You can send it
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.320]   to me, of course, at patreon.com/patron. You can go to my website, whatever it is, radicalperso-wise.com/patron
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:05.640]   if you ever want to. But I'm going to save you $25. Just go to bombfell.com/rpf. B-O-M-B-F-E-L-L.com/rpf.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.400]   Now let's talk about what to do if you got to get out in seconds. The only way to be
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:20.180]   prepared to evacuate your home in a few minutes is to have the most important things pre-packed.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.200]   Every member of your family should, including your pets, every member of your family should
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:31.080]   at all times have a bag or a suitcase, a backpack, a duffel bag, a suitcase, even a box of some
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   kind that's packed with the basic things that would be necessary to sustain themselves,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   to sustain you, and to sustain each of them for at least about three days. If you go on
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.860]   the federal disaster websites, you'll find lists at the FEMA disaster websites of what
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:52.040]   you should keep in a kit, of a 72-hour kit. Commonly in the online world, they call it
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.200]   a bug-out bag if you got to bug out, if you got to get out in a moment.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.860]   Now the contents that you should put in such a kit will vary. The importance of the contents
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.880]   will vary depending on what type of emergency is forcing you to leave. For example, if you
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:14.400]   are fleeing from a wildfire that is attacking your neighborhood, the most important content
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:23.680]   of your 72-hour bag is going to be your backups of your electronic documents. I recommend
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.840]   to you that you make a digital backup and archive of all of your most important documents.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.220]   You can do this easily if you have a scanner or have access to a scanner. Many people have
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.600]   a scanner that they can use at work. That would be fine. Or if you just simply use your
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.720]   phone and install a scanning app on your phone and scan the pictures of your most important
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:52.120]   documents. For example, birth certificates, marriage licenses, all of the insurance information,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.440]   copies of your insurance policies, or at the very least, you should maintain an Excel document,
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.040]   a spreadsheet that contains all of the numbers of the insurance policies, contact information,
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.120]   etc. All of these items need to be prepared in advance. I recommend that you save the
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.360]   files, that you create a directory, you should create an Excel spreadsheet that has a listing
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.480]   of all of your property, serial numbers for anything that you own that has serial numbers
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:26.360]   on it. Again, bank account information, login information, that file should be carefully
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   encrypted. It should be stored in an encrypted vault on a memory stick of some kind, SD
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:41.360]   card works well or a USB memory stick works well. You should take very, very careful with
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.800]   that information. If I were you, I would recommend using an encrypted file within an encrypted
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.400]   container within an encrypted drive. You've got triple encryption. Now, if that's beyond
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.840]   your skill level with encryption protocols, then simplify that and do something a little
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.960]   bit easier for you. But that information needs to be protected. On there, you should have
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.880]   photographs of all of your property, especially anything that you're going to need to demonstrate
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:14.560]   for your insurance claims. So you should photograph your property. You should regularly do a video
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.680]   tour of your home to demonstrate the value of the property that's in your home. It's
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.760]   not unusual for people to accumulate tens of thousands of dollars of furniture and other
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.800]   property and you may need that when it comes time to filing your home insurance claim.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   You should keep on there current photos of your family members. And this file and this
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   drive, it should be duplicated. One should be stored with you. One should be stored in
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.520]   an off-site location, in a secure location, but completely off-site, whether that is something
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.920]   that you have access to, for example, a safety deposit box that you maintain, or whether
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.020]   that's in somebody else's safety deposit box or somebody else that maybe somebody else
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.000]   in their personal safe. It should be stored in another location as well in case you can't
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.240]   get out or you can't get it out. But that should be in your bag. That will have applicability
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.920]   long – in many things more than just in a fire. But it will come into place in a fire.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.680]   For example, one thing that I recommend is that you maintain in there relatively current
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.560]   photos of every member of your family in case that photo needed to be put on a missing persons
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.720]   poster. One of the major challenges right now in California is there are, in my memory,
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.680]   over 40 people confirmed dead, but there are about 150-ish people who are missing right
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.040]   now. And hopefully most of those people will show up, but it's valuable to have a photo
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.080]   that can be distributed carefully. And it's nice to have one that is just this very simple
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.280]   photo of your children in case they were ever missing. And it's nice to have that available
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.460]   to you. So very quickly you can pass that along to the authorities who will then distribute
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.400]   it to help you to get your children back. It takes time to go through and put these
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   things together. But once you've done it, for the most part, you've got it.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.080]   And so here is a list of things that I recommend that you consider and make sure that you have
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.840]   for the future. So information such as social security cards, copies of your driver's
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.440]   licenses, birth certificates, copies of your passports, marriage certificates. And of course
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.040]   here I'm talking about both physical copies ready to go in a moment's notice, but also
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.920]   digital backups in case your physical copies are burned up. Records on all of your financial
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.720]   accounts, all of your bank, investment, credit cards, loan accounts, all of the information
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:33.400]   on how to access those accounts, a backup of your password database should be included
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.120]   there, phone numbers and account numbers for all of your accounts. Health records, very
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   important and valuable to have. So that's immunization records or information on your
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.600]   allergies, dietary restrictions, current medications or past medical and surgical treatments. That's
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.880]   particularly valuable. Pet information, descriptions of your pet, photos of your pets, contact
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.320]   information for your vet, any medical notes or medications that they may be on. Listings
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.520]   of all of your property, information on your car, your home, any kind of home inventory
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:12.920]   items, photos, a video tour is also excellent and valuation estimates can be useful as well.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.880]   Insurance documents, all of the insurance documents and especially having those things
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.840]   with you because sometimes if your home's burned down, you're going to be filing insurance
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:27.080]   claims from a hotel room. Copies of your wills and medical directives and then any other
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.840]   valuable things like photographs or other things that can be digitized. In today's world
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.920]   where storage has become so cheap, there's no reason not to digitize all of your important
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:44.680]   and valuable photos and keep those on a secured computer drive in an off-site location backed
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   up.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.920]   So if you got to get out quick, grab your bags, get in the car and go. Now a couple
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.200]   things that are important. Hopefully your car needs to work and this is one of the reasons
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.240]   why as with anything, we need to give good attention to our vehicles, make sure they're
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.720]   in good working order. Nothing like a good disaster movie when the car is sitting there
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   and not starting. Dante's Peak was one of my favorite years ago and I think there was
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.080]   a scene like that in there. The mountain is blowing up, got to get off the volcano mountain
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.040]   and of course the cars don't want to start when they need to. So keep the car going and
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.520]   make sure there's always gas in the car. That's one of the reasons why I recommend making
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.720]   a habit to keep the car at least always a third or half full and make sure that you
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   have enough gas in the car in case you ever need to go.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.320]   One interesting story, let me read to you now from the Wall Street Journal article,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:41.880]   Wildfire Victims Had Only Seconds to Make Choices. This was the lead to the story. Ukiah,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.640]   California. Hurtling down a mile-long dirt driveway, the wildfire closing in, Eli Monroe
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.720]   pulled to a stop at a crossroads. He sat for a moment with his girlfriend, his parents
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.000]   in the car behind them deciding which way to turn on Tomkey Road. The fastest way out
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.560]   was to the right, toward Route 101, a freeway they had hoped would take them to safety.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.120]   Flames licked the roadsides in that direction. A left turn would lead to creeks and backcountry
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.040]   dirt roads they hadn't traveled in months, a route that carried the risk of a death trap.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.600]   They went left. As they passed a few cars speeding the opposite way, Mr. Monroe, 34
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.400]   years old, recalled thinking, "Why are we the only ones going this direction? Are we
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:28.120]   digging our own grave?" Now dropping down in the story, we read this about Mr. Monroe.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.520]   Mr. Monroe and his family got their warning call, more on that in a moment, at 12.48 a.m.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.360]   Monday and began alerting neighbors. Less than 45 minutes later, they were in their
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.200]   cars deciding if he should turn left toward the dirt road through the woods. He thought
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:48.800]   he could recall the way from past trips to the Eel River during summers growing up there.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.760]   Once they hit the dirt road, the fire began to recede. A tire on Mr. Monroe's mom's
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:58.200]   car blew out after the last creek crossing, but by then they were safe. On Wednesday,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.880]   they learned their home and most of the others around them off Tom Key Road were destroyed.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.240]   So one of the most important things, you need to keep your vehicle in good working order
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.440]   so that it can get you out of there when you need to. You need to have the equipment, the
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.320]   fuel to get you there. But then it's important to have those routes and that route information
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:21.760]   on hand. One of the things that has made combating these fire or getting people notification
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.440]   warnings in this particular wildfire incidents, these incidents in California has been that
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.400]   the cell phone service has not been working reliably. Some of the cell phone towers have
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   been burned and so the cell phone coverage has been fairly spotty. This has made it difficult
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.120]   to issue evacuation alerts for the authorities in some cases. It's resulted in some people
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.800]   not getting the alert. But this can be a real problem if you depend only on your cell phone
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.360]   for the knowledge of where to go and how to get out. And frankly, most of us do. We're
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.560]   so accustomed now to having our GPS on our cell phone that many of us don't maintain
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.780]   maps in our cars. Many of us don't have external GPS units and many of us don't pay as much
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:08.120]   attention as we probably should to knowing how to navigate around our own houses. So
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.360]   that can be a major problem. I recommend that you always keep a GPS unit in your car that's
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.440]   not connected to the cell phone grid. You can buy a GPS unit today for a brand new one
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.320]   from Garmin or TomTom or whomever for a hundred bucks for a cheap one. You could probably
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.200]   find a used one for less. And the great thing is those types of GPSs don't require the cell
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.400]   phone network to work like our phones do. And so if you all of a sudden have the normal
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.960]   way that you would go out to the right, but it looks like there's fire there and you've
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   got to go take the back roads to the left, that GPS may very well get you out. And I
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:55.200]   think even in navigating, some of the videos of people trying to navigate through the actual
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:01.400]   fire, people who couldn't even – who couldn't drive because they couldn't see, I think
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.320]   even there a GPS unit would be helpful. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.520]   in the middle of the fire. I know for me when I'm driving in foggy conditions, I rely
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   upon the GPS as a secondary safety device to help me make sure I'm anticipating the
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.960]   curves that are coming up in the road and it helps me to see better. Another thing of
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.440]   course is maps, having maps of your area, state maps and local maps so that if you do
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   need to get out on back roads that you're not used to driving all the time, that you
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.840]   know the way out and you can work your way out on a map.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.120]   One more comment – two more comments on evacuations. One is with regard to when to
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.560]   go, one of the interesting controversies that's emerging from this current fire situation
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.800]   is the notification system. It's important that if there is a notification system in
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.680]   your area that you put yourself on it. That's being a part of the official local emergency
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   preparedness app or getting on the reverse 911 phone system or being able to get those
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.760]   alerts. Sign up for the alerts so you make sure that you have the information that you
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:04.280]   need. In an emergency, information is crucial and so you should have multiple ways of getting
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.560]   information. Yes, the local Facebook group or yes, the local fire page is going to be
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.960]   very valuable but make sure that you also have a radio that's not dependent upon the
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.120]   cell phone network. Make sure that you're also signed up for the text alerts which may
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.160]   come through when your data access isn't working on your phone. So make sure that you
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.000]   have the information but listen to it and make your own decision. You've got to always
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.800]   filter information from government officials by recognizing the fact that they are responsible
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:43.120]   for the masses. The emergency managers there in – I forget which county it was – in
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.440]   California, here, Sonoma County – let me read from the Wall Street Journal article.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.800]   Hannah User, a spokeswoman for Sonoma County, said officials decided not to send a wireless
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.160]   emergency alert which would have gone to every cell phone in the area. "Emergency managers
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   noted potential risks of these types of alerts causing clogged roads and unnecessary panic,
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.720]   making it hard for those who were in the most significant danger to get out safely," Ms.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.160]   User said. "We chose the best tools available to ensure residents who were in the most significant
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.480]   danger had the safest path possible to get out." Officials said they planned to analyze
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.280]   the decision after the fires were over. For now, they said they are focused on protecting
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.760]   people from further harm.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.800]   Government officials always have to think in terms of the masses. That's usually not
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.960]   going to be good for you because you're not concerned with the masses. You're concerned
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:41.040]   with you and you're concerned with those that are close to you. You've got to always
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:46.280]   do what's right for you and make sure to care for yourself. And you've got to do it
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.120]   a little bit out of sync with the masses in order for things to work properly.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.600]   Here in Florida, we're coming to the end of hurricane season. Right now, I can go down
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.760]   and I can get all the plywood that I want to get with no rationing. I can get all the
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.600]   bottled water that I want to get with no rationing. I can get as many generators as I want. I
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.240]   can fill up as many gas cans at the gas station as I want. I can get all the canned food.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.680]   I can load up my house with all the materials that I need to get me through a hurricane.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.540]   And there's no problem. I'm not causing any problems for anyone else and they're not causing
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.520]   any problems for me.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.040]   But as soon as there's a hurricane that's headed our way, the rationing starts, the
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.120]   supplies dry up because the masses start to move in that direction. Don't be part of the
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.240]   masses. If there's a fire that's threatening and emergency officials are thinking about
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.000]   notifications, they don't want to clog the roads all of a sudden because then they'll
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.040]   get accused of saying, "Hey, you clogged the roads and now 300 people died because the
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.480]   roads were clogged." That's a valid concern that they have to face, but that's not your
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.560]   concern. So you get out.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   Now let's talk about some equipment that's unique to fires. I think it's important that
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:05.440]   you prepare for a fire evacuation. Now, one simple way to do this, a few pieces of equipment
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.640]   that are important in your bug out bag and your 72-hour kit, you should always have something
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.460]   like leather gloves. When fires start to come, heat starts to occur. This is the same in
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:21.080]   house fires. One thing in a house fire, you should keep in your home fire emergency kit,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.400]   thick leather gloves that would help you be able to get out of the house if your home
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.920]   was on fire with just you, a normal house fire, not even a wildland fire. Those should
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.900]   be in your fire kits.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.240]   One of the videos that I watched from California was a cell phone video of two young men who
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:42.200]   were trying to get out of the fire and one of them had to get out to open a gate. He
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.400]   couldn't open the gate or he opened the gate, but he burned his hands because the metal
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.220]   was so hot. So gloves would have protected his hands. This should be a standard part
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:56.600]   of your earthquake kit if you live in California. Obviously, you face a major risk and anywhere
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.400]   where earthquakes are likely. You face a major risk of an earthquake and if there's an
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.800]   earthquake and there's a building collapse around you, you want to make sure that you
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.640]   have gloves available to you in your emergency kit so that you can dig your way out or possibly
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.680]   dig to save a family member, something like that. So gloves are very valuable.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:22.300]   With regard to fire safety, one of the things that I would think is a very valuable accessory
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:29.440]   to have is one of those smoke hoods or air hoods that is commonly sold for escape from
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.540]   house fire. There are good ones on the market that will last you for about an hour of use.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.780]   In a wildfire, a wildfire sucks up all the oxygen and it kills people just if you're
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.980]   even in the middle of it. You may not burn your flesh, but it can destroy your lungs
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.180]   and it can kill you just from there not being any air to breathe.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.900]   In the same video with the two young men, if you're interested in seeing it, go to
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.180]   my Twitter page, twitter.com/JoshuaSheets and you can find it and watch it on YouTube.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.740]   The same video, the guy got out of the car and he couldn't breathe. He got back in
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.060]   the car. He said, "I can't get out again because I can't breathe." There was no
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:09.300]   air out of the car for him to breathe. So you can have some of those smoke hoods available
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.200]   to you. Those can save your life in a house fire, allow you to get out without experiencing
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.020]   smoke inhalation, and they can save your life in a wildfire.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.900]   Hopefully those ideas, although I'm sure they're incomplete, are helpful to help
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.980]   you plan to protect life, which is the most important thing.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.900]   Now what about protecting property? Here, there are things that you can do long in advance
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.140]   and things that you can do a little bit in advance. I'm sure that if you live in a
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:42.180]   wildland fire area, you receive information and advice on preparing your home for fire.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.460]   Of course, whether or not this will be effective, obviously it depends. The fires that have
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.980]   been going through some of the neighborhoods essentially look like they're just going
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.340]   house to house. If you've chosen to situate your house in a subdivision where you're
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.260]   very close to your neighbor's houses, well, if your neighbor's houses catch on fire,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.540]   very likely it's going to catch your house on fire. They're just simply that close.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.300]   It's different than being out in a rural area. But there are a lot of things that can
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.220]   be done to fight fire. Years ago, I first became interested in permaculture design.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:18.900]   One of the things that most interested me, I started reading publications by Bill Mollison,
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:27.140]   who was one of the founders of what is called permaculture, which is a design strategy for
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.620]   basically designing life intelligently, life systems, life-supporting systems intelligently.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:38.260]   I was fascinated to read and to listen to some of his stuff on fire prevention. I had
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.980]   never thought, not being from the country and being from Florida, I'd never thought
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:46.740]   about designing a property in order to be protected from fire. But I've become convinced
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:51.380]   that it's very doable to actually think about how you situate your house and think about
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.060]   these things in order to limit the risk.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:00.180]   If I ever were to develop a property where I had the space to do it, I would try to take
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:06.260]   into account all of these things and design the property to be protected from fire. One
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.780]   of the things that interested me after the Fort McMurray wildfires last summer, I started
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.780]   researching why some people would say, "I'll stay behind." Even knowledgeable people would
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.660]   say, "I'll stay behind and fight the fire." I, not having been through a wildland fire,
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:24.100]   hadn't understood how they spread. But since then, I've learned that fires, wildland fires,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   are very fightable, at least under appropriate conditions. Many times, the way that they
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.020]   spread is through throwing embers out. And if you can just fight the small fires that
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:45.100]   can spring up, you can probably protect a house. The firefighters themselves will often
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.460]   put themselves in a situation where they can protect houses. One of the things that wildland
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.500]   firefighters do is they protect houses.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:56.540]   So let's talk about planning. First, the things that you do will be helpful to physically
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.500]   protect your house, but the things that you do will also be helpful to encourage and invite
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.220]   other people, namely firefighters, to protect your house. One thing I learned in researching
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:12.260]   it a year ago is that firefighters, wildland firefighters, have guidance on the houses
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:19.380]   that they can protect, and it's based upon how well the house is squared away. So if
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.500]   there's a fire and the firefighters are in a safe enough zone, and there are structures,
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.300]   the fire team will put firefighters at the house or on the property to try to fight any
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.420]   small fires that may be started, and they'll often do it with good success. But there are
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.580]   certain risk factors that they look for. I looked up, when researching it, I looked up
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.980]   what's called the incident response pocket guide, the IRPG, which is passed out by the
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.400]   Forest Service to wildland firefighters. And in the very beginning of it, they give the
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.260]   firefighters the guidance to know whether or not they can decide that it's good for
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.260]   them to go ahead and defend a structure. And here are some of the things that will help
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:05.180]   them to defend a structure if these things are not there, that they'll evaluate. They'll
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:10.140]   evaluate the access. So reading from the incident response pocket guide, it says, "If there
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.620]   are narrow roads, unknown bridge limits, and septic tank locations, that makes it hard
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.180]   for them to get their trucks and equipment in. So make sure that your home has good access
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.340]   if possible. If there are ornamental plants and combustible debris that are sited next
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.100]   to the structure, that will discourage them because they know how much harder it is. But
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:32.400]   if you don't have ornamental plants and combustible debris next to the structure, they'll be willing
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.220]   to put resources into protecting and defending your home. Wooden siding and/or wooden roof
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:45.060]   materials, that's a no-no. So go with the fire safe or fireproof siding materials. If
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.380]   the house has open vents, eaves, decks, or other ember traps, that's a hazard. And so
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.980]   that'll diminish their willingness and ability to stay and fight the fire. If the house has
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.420]   fuel tanks or hazardous materials around or power lines or limited water sources, those
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:10.980]   are all things that will discourage a firefighter from staying on and protecting the house simply
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.220]   because they know that the job is probably just too hard and they're not going to be
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:20.100]   able to do it. But if those things are squared away, if your fire escaping and your fireproofing
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:25.100]   has been done in advance and that's squared away, then even just the firefighters themselves
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:31.580]   will be able to justify spending more resources on your property. That may help your property
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:37.700]   to be one that is not burned. I want to wrap up this show, the third part of this show
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.540]   here with some information and advice from a couple of sources. Most of this is coming
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:50.260]   from firewise.org, an organization, Firewise USA, Residents Reducing Wildfire Risks by
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:57.180]   the NFPA, which I bet stands for the National Fire Prevention Association, although I did
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.140]   not confirm that. But these are things that are simple. Go on firewise.org and you'll
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:08.640]   find all kinds of information and advice directly from those who know and want to keep your
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:14.540]   house from burning. But for example, for their homeowner checklist, this is important, reading
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.060]   from their homeowner checklist, "Wildfires don't have to destroy everything in their
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.980]   path. Science and research have proven that using Firewise principles in your landscaping
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:28.300]   can minimize damage and prevent losses. The work you do today can make a difference. Follow
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.500]   these simple action steps now and throughout the year to prepare and help reduce the risk
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.940]   of your home and property becoming fuel for a wildfire. Clear needles, leaves, and other
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:42.180]   debris from the roof, gutters, eaves, porches, and decks. This reduces the chance of embers
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.640]   igniting your home. To reduce ember penetration, replace or repair loose or missing roof shingles
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:53.380]   or tiles and caulk any gaps or openings on roof edges. Cover exterior attic vents and
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:58.340]   close under eave and soffit vents with metal wire mesh no larger than 1/8 inch to prevent
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.780]   embers from entering the home. Remove items stored under decks or porches. Replace vegetation
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.300]   in these areas with rock or gravel. Replace mulch with hardscaping, including rock, gravel,
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.620]   or stone. If it can catch fire, don't let it touch your house, deck, or porch. Remove
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:21.780]   flammable items within 30 feet of all structures, including firewood piles, portable propane
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:28.100]   tanks, and dry and dead vegetation. Dry grass and shrubs are fuel for wildfire, so keep
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:33.980]   your lawn hydrated and maintained. If it is brown, trim it to reduce fire intensity, and
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.160]   don't let debris and lawn cuttings linger. Dispose of these items quickly to reduce fuel
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.860]   for fire. Fire can spread to treetops. If you have tall trees on your property, prune
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.300]   low-hanging branches 6 to 10 feet from the ground, and for smaller trees, prune low-hanging
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.100]   branches to no more than a third of the tree's height. Remove tall grasses, vines, and shrubs
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.300]   from under trees.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.020]   Here are a few other suggestions for when there's actually a fire threatening from
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.660]   FireWise and then give you information of actually what to do during a fire. So what
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.180]   to do during watches or warnings of high fire danger from FireWise. Make sure there's at
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.820]   least a 72-hour supply of important medications in your go-bag. Know which personal items,
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.060]   pictures, documents, etc. have been prioritized to take if time permits when evacuation is
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:24.820]   necessary. Remove deck or patio furniture, cushions, and doormats to prevent ember ignitions.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.820]   Remove portable propane tanks from the deck or patio. Know how to turn off the gas to
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.740]   the home. Place a ladder against the house for fire department use. Have your garden
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:39.140]   hoses connected for fire department use. Make sure windows, doors, and garage doors are
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.660]   closed. Make sure windows are closed on vehicles that will remain at the residence while you're
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.660]   evacuated.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:51.020]   And then I want to close by reading a couple of pages from a book called "Firescaping,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:56.860]   Creating Fire-Resistant Landscapes, Gardens, and Properties in California's Diverse Environments."
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:02.540]   This is by an author named Douglas Kent. Eight bucks on Amazon. Ten left in stock order soon.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:09.580]   Again, it's called "Firescaping." But here is a few pages from his information on what
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.980]   to actually do during a fire.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:17.020]   It is common to see individuals standing with a hose, watering their garden or roof during
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:22.420]   a wildfire. There are, however, many other chores that precede watering with a hose.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:28.020]   In some cases, watering a roof is a poor use of time. Below are prioritized tasks for anyone
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.240]   defending their home against a wildfire. In most situations, firefighters will ask everyone
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.140]   to leave the fire area. If they ask, do not hesitate to go.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.680]   Protect yourself and others. Safely get all members and pets out of the house and away
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:48.660]   from the fire area. Get dressed for the fire. Put on wool or cotton pants, a long-sleeved
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:55.280]   shirt and a jacket. Also, grab a pair of gloves, a handkerchief and goggles for added protection.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.100]   Move and park cars off driveways and roadways so emergency vehicles can get by. Pack all
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:06.460]   irreplaceable items, such as photos, art, address books, bonds, stocks, birth certificates,
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:10.540]   and the stuff you'll need for a couple days away from the home, such as medications, toiletries,
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:15.020]   and a change of clothes. Place all of this in the car. Make sure to roll all the windows
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:19.980]   up. Leave the doors unlocked and the keys in the ignition. Even if the roads become
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.300]   unusable, a car is a safe place for irreplaceable items.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.480]   Fill as many containers as possible with drinking water. You'll need several bottles of water
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.380]   to quench your thirst and to keep the handkerchief around your face moist. Pack valuables, such
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:40.820]   as jewelry and clothes, in weighted plastic bags and toss them into a pool or pond.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.560]   Protect the inside of a home. Turn off the gas at the line leading to the house. Shut
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.000]   all doors and windows inside a house. Remove flammable drapes from windows. Close Venetian
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.780]   blinds and other non-flammable window coverings. Close storm shutters. Close all attic, basement,
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.520]   and eave vents. Fill sinks and bathtubs with water. Place towels or rugs next to these
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.560]   indoor water reserves. The water reserves and towels can be used to extinguish flames
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.820]   within a structure. Turn on all the lights in a house. A smoke-filled house is difficult
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:21.180]   to see and navigate in. Turn off fans and cooling systems. Leave all doors unlocked.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.620]   In the fires of 2003, one fireman was seriously injured and another died trying to get into
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.060]   a house that was locked.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.380]   Protect your pets. There are three options for pets during a wildfire. Flee with the
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:37.740]   owner, stay in a safe place while the owner fights the fire, or be stranded with no help.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.580]   Steps can be taken to increase the chances of survival in all three circumstances. Naturally,
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.660]   it is always safer for the owner and pet to flee a fire. Make sure the animal has an identification
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.980]   tag. Many emergency shelters refuse to take pets. It is important to know where you can
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:59.260]   safely drop yours off. A network of family, friends, and some hotels should be prearranged.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.620]   If you decide to fight the fire, place the pet in a familiar, safe, and secure spot,
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.460]   such as a car. Carry a photo of your pet for possible identification reasons. Grab a week's
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.980]   worth of food and medicine. If for any reason you have to flee without taking your pet,
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.260]   then uncage or unleash it.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:21.740]   Protect the outside of a home. Remove all combustible items from under and around the
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:27.180]   house. Examples include stored newspapers, firewood, furniture, and plants that have
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.980]   grown up and under a house. Place a ladder against the side of the house, creating easy
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:37.740]   access to the roof. Sweep and clean the roof of all ignitable material. Clean obstacles
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.300]   such as patio furniture from around the house and put them inside the house or out in the
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.580]   yard. Hook up hoses to every water faucet around the house. Attach an adjustable nozzle
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:53.820]   at the end of each hose. Place shovels, rakes, and hose in a visible place. Place large,
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.580]   watertight cans and buckets around the house, then fill them with water. Place towels and
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:03.340]   rugs next to the water buckets. If for some reason water becomes unavailable, these wet
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.100]   towels will help beat out small sparks and flames.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:12.340]   Water combustible roofs now. To make the most of water's limited supply, stand below the
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:19.420]   roof and shoot water up into it. Unlike watering the roof from above, watering from below gets
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.940]   the water into the small cracks and crevices where sparks are likely to get caught without
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.200]   the excess water runoff.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.060]   With regard to any other suggestions, including property design suggestions, that is beyond
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:37.500]   my expertise. All I can do is point you in the right direction. If you are interested
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:42.460]   in the subject to protect your property, then there are resources available from people
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:47.820]   who are competent in that area to advise you. From my limited reading, I am convinced that
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.540]   it is very possible to design a property to be protected from fire and that it's something
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.720]   that really we should do. I get very annoyed when we just do stupid stuff again and again
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.620]   and again and again, and we don't think about designing things intelligently. And then disasters
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.860]   come and they have massive price tags, and we just say, "Oh, let's just do the same thing
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:15.940]   again and not apply a little bit of intelligent design to our circumstances." So let's not
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:25.700]   be those who perpetuate that cycle. Let's be those who work to properly protect our
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.820]   things, our own stuff, with good intelligent design.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.580]   Finally, with regard to financial resources, just be thankful and hopefully – just hope
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:41.460]   that your house is not an overly large portion of your investment portfolio. It's important
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:48.060]   that your home not be the only financial asset that you have. It can be very risky to have
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:52.060]   a house account for a very large percentage of your net worth. If a fire comes through
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:57.140]   and destroys your house, it destroys it. It's far more risky than owning stock in hundreds
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.260]   and hundreds of companies that are dispersed in many industries all around the world. The
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:06.540]   stock is far less risky than having all of your money tied up in your personal house.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.580]   So that's important. It's also important that you make sure that you don't put yourself
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:17.020]   in a situation where your valuable physical property would all be destroyed if your home
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.140]   were destroyed. That's bad diversification strategy. That's bad planning. Don't keep
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:27.860]   all of your valuable physical personal property in your home. Diversify it. Keep some of your
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:33.300]   valuable physical property in a safety deposit box or in a secondary backup location of some
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:43.420]   kind. Don't keep it all at home. My final comment is on the topic of insurance.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   California property insurance is out of my area of expertise. So I don't want to make
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:54.100]   any mistakes to comment on it much. Just to know that I know that California does have
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:51:00.620]   unique risks and so those risks are reflected in California property insurance policies.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:09.380]   If any of you listening are a California property insurance expert and would like to come on
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.140]   and talk about good insurance strategies for wildfire planning, I'd be happy to do that.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:22.300]   That would be great. But I will read to you a column from the Los Angeles Times titled
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:26.740]   As California Burns, Here's What You Need to Know About Fire Insurance. And I will encourage
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:32.780]   you to do a review with your property insurance agent when it's time and to carefully review
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.860]   these things in advance. It's too late for the California homeowners to do anything with
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:40.380]   their insurance – home insurance. But it's not too late for you. So let me read you this
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:44.740]   column from the Los Angeles Times that gives some useful suggestions and that will close
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.180]   us out today.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:54.060]   Most – author here is David Lazarus. Most homeowners insurance policies cover fire damage.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.740]   But heads up, that's not the whole story. If you live in a high-risk area such as near
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:03.060]   a canyon, you may need to pay more for additional coverage. And if a fire has devastated whole
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.780]   communities, such as what we're seeing now in Northern California, your home replacement
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:12.580]   dollars could be stretched thin as costs soar for everything from materials to labor.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.060]   All those commercials about insurance companies offering peace of mind when things like this
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.860]   happen, those are just ads, said Amy Bacht, executive director of United Policyholders,
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:25.780]   a San Francisco-based advocacy group. In reality, insurance policies are written by teams of
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.900]   lawyers and it can be rough for homeowners, she said.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:33.380]   Most homeowners insurance covers both your home and all property within. More than 90
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.500]   percent of homeowners buy coverage, according to recent estimates, and as many as 40 percent
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.740]   of renters purchase insurance for their belongings.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.500]   After the recent drought turned California into a huge pile of kindling, insurers racked
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:51.220]   up billions of dollars in fire-related claims. Some, such as Allstate, stopped writing new
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:56.220]   policies. Others, such as Farmers and State Farm, became choosier about homes they'd
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.880]   cover. The insurance industry says it's ready to handle claims from the fires now
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.260]   raging statewide. "Insurers will 100 percent be there for homeowners," said Nicole
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.220]   Ganley, a spokeswoman for the Western Region of the Property Casualty Insurers Association
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:14.500]   of America, a trade group. "Insurers are moving very quickly to help policyholders."
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.940]   Be that as it may, coverage may not always be easy to obtain. Homeowners in high-risk
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:23.060]   areas who can't find coverage in the open market may have to turn to a state-sponsored
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:28.980]   program called the California FAIR plan. FAIR covers up to $1.5 million for a structure
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.500]   and its contents, which in some cases won't be enough for full replacement of a lost home
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.500]   and property.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.380]   If there's one takeaway from the blazes now causing widespread damage in the Golden
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.100]   State, it's for homeowners and renters to make sure their coverage is up to date, and
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:47.900]   that nothing sneaky has made its way into your policy. Narbe Shervanian, a Glendale
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.660]   lawyer who handles fire-related claims, said it's not unheard of for an insurer to change
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.380]   the terms of a policy during the renewal process. "It might be disclosed," he said, "but
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.900]   let's be honest, nobody really reads all this stuff."
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.740]   As a result, you may find that you're shouldering more of the risk than you originally thought.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:10.900]   Shervanian also warned of seemingly arbitrary responses to fire claims. If his structure
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.700]   burns down, then all legitimate insurance claims will be honored.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.980]   But what if there's a wildfire nearby and your home is impacted by smoke and ash? Will
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:22.980]   your homeowners' coverage pay for the cleanup? "We're seeing issues with smoke and ash
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.420]   damaging homes and insurance companies playing games," Shervanian said. "One year they
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:30.380]   do one thing, one year they do something else."
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.100]   It's very important as the economy recovers from the Great Recession to be mindful of
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.260]   rising property values. Yes, that's great from a "maybe I'll sell" perspective.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:43.460]   From a fire perspective, it can be a whole other thing. Replacement costs you locked
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.080]   in for your insurance policy may no longer reflect current conditions, meaning you may
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.180]   have to reach into your own pocket to make yourself whole. Also, widespread fire damage
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:57.900]   will be felt in the market in the form of rising costs for materials such as wood and
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:02.820]   concrete and almost certainly higher labor costs as contractors take advantage of supply
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:07.620]   and demand situations. A smart idea is to pay a little extra for what's known as an
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:12.380]   extended replacement cost endorsement. This is basically additional coverage intended
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:17.980]   to accommodate at least a portion of any unexpected cost increases. You can also purchase a
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:22.100]   additional coverage for code upgrades. For example, the rules might have changed for
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:27.140]   electrical systems or insulation since your house was built. Code upgrade insurance will
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:32.300]   protect you from so-called "betterments" that your basic policy might not address.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.740]   Insurance companies have had enough experience with fires in California to do a good job
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:42.300]   of resolving claims, said Bok at United Policyholders. But that's still not always the case. I strongly
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:46.220]   advise homeowners and renters to take their smartphones and walk around their homes shooting
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:51.300]   a video of their belongings. This can provide helpful evidence if an insurer disputes, say,
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:57.020]   that you owned a state-of-the-art home theater setup. If you have to evacuate, save all receipts.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:02.820]   Many homeowner policies include so-called "ale coverage" as in additional living expenses
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:09.080]   (ALE) which will include costs such as hotel rooms, food, and rentals. So there are some
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.860]   useful suggestions from a Los Angeles Time column from a couple of days ago.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:19.380]   I've thrown a lot of information at you. I did my best to make it useful to you, but
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   I definitely threw a lot of information at you with a little bit of repetition. I guess
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:30.380]   my closing thoughts that I'd like to leave you with are these. Thinking about any...
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:37.700]   Each type of event has some kind of commonality. And it's important to consider what those
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:42.820]   commonalities are. For example, when it comes to... And I think all of us should think through
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:47.820]   what are our own most likely personal disasters that we might face. For me, what I consider
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:54.160]   to be one of the most likely personal disasters would be a home fire. Just simply a simple
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.100]   home fire catches my house on fire and I gotta get out. And so in one way, that's exactly
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.320]   the... That's the thing that I need to think through and plan for. But a hurricane has
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.660]   a very similar risk profile in terms of I have more warning, but I still need to do
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:13.020]   similar types of things. I still need to be able to get out. And another likely disaster
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.340]   would be something like a burglary. Somebody breaks in and steals things from my house
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.900]   that are important to me. Well, some things I do are common among all of these things.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:27.620]   If I have my important insurance and financial paperwork backed up on secure drives that
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.700]   are outside of the house that are in secure locations, then no matter whether that's a
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:40.900]   home fire, a hurricane, or a burglary, I'm helped by all of those things. Or another
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:47.660]   likely disaster that I think is worth planning for is as the parent of small children, I
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.060]   am concerned about the abduction of my children. Well, how do you plan for that? One thing
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.700]   you do is you take a photograph of your children and make sure that you have a photograph in
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:58.820]   case your child is abducted or just simply goes missing. We don't have to put the criminal
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.420]   element on it. They just go missing and they wander off. Then to make sure that I have
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.600]   a photograph and that photograph is readily available to be passed along to emergency
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.420]   crews who are helping me to search for my child. I need the same exact thing for a fire.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.580]   So when you start thinking through these scenarios, think them through and what you find is there
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:21.360]   are common steps that are common in all of them. And as you start to do it, you'll start
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.480]   to realize that the things you do to prepare for one scenario are very similar to the things
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.580]   you do to prepare for another scenario. With hurricane planning, you don't put big trees
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:37.400]   next to your house, just like with fire planning. With hurricane planning, you build a strong
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:43.720]   metal roof, just like fire planning. I'm out of music. I'm going to be done here. But it's
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.040]   a hope that you see – that's why I wanted to address this. I hope that you see that
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.000]   as you start to think through these things, it's not insurance that solves the problem.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.080]   Insurance has a place. But insurance is only one hammer in your toolbox. And it's not the
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:01.640]   best hammer because when you're trying to escape from the wildfire, it doesn't give
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.160]   you a whole lot of comfort to know that your home insurance is paid up. You're trying to
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:11.200]   protect life. The home insurance policy comes in after the fact. We're out of music. I'll
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.680]   just close with this. If this has been useful for you, if this information has been helpful
