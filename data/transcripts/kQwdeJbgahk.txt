[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Well now, we continue with this evening our consideration of some of these special
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.120]   terms in connection with the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. We've been engaged for a
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   very long time in dealing with the various aspects of this most important
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.880]   doctrine because it is here we are dealing with the application of salvation.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.440]   That is the peculiar function of the third person in the Blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.800]   The Father has planned the scheme of salvation, the Son came into the world in
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960]   order to carry it out and to make it possible for us, and it is the work of
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320]   the Holy Spirit to apply that to us, to mediate it to us, to make it actual in us
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.960]   and in our lives and in our experiences. And having considered it worked out in
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   the scripture, we've come to these terms which are used and which must be
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480]   considered and dealt with if our consideration of this doctrine is to be
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   complete. Now we've spent most of our time so far in dealing with that term in
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.440]   which we considered the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Yesterday we also looked at
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.420]   the doctrine concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit. Well now this evening we
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.400]   come on to something which it seems to me follows very naturally and logically
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.680]   and indeed quite inevitably from all that we have been saying. We come to the
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.640]   next term which is the term concerning the sealing of the Spirit. Now let me
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.240]   give you the scriptures. This term is used three times. First of all in the
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.920]   second epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter verses 21 and 22. "Now he
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.400]   which establisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God who hath
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts." That's 2
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.200]   Corinthians 1 22 especially. Then you get it again in the epistle to the
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.440]   Ephesians in the first chapter and the 13th verse. "In whom," that's to say in the
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.880]   Lord Jesus Christ, "he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.320]   gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he were sealed
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.280]   with that Holy Spirit of promise." And indeed we should go on to verse 14 which
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   is "the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.640]   possession unto the praise of his glory." And then the third reference is the one
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.280]   which came in the reading at the beginning in the fourth chapter of the
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.800]   epistle to the Ephesians verse 30 which is about grieving the Spirit. "Grieve not
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.360]   the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." Now
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.640]   this is clearly a most important bit of teaching. The context in which you find
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.000]   it appearing each time shows us the extreme practical importance of
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   understanding what exactly is meant at this point. Now the best way, the way that
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.720]   has always been adopted by most teachers in considering this doctrine, is to ask
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.920]   the question, "What are the normal functions and purposes of a seal?" What
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.880]   does a seal signify? Why is it used? And the answer is that it has three main
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.920]   functions. The first function of a seal is to authenticate something or to
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.840]   certify something. It was done very often in the past you remember a man would put
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.240]   his own personal particular seal on a document and that certified that this
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.720]   document really was his document and said what it purported to say. It was a
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.640]   means of authentication. It's used like that in the Scriptures. We are told that
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   a man who believes the gospel has thereby set his seal to it, that it is
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   true. He isn't one who denies it, he doesn't make out that God is a liar
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.160]   argues the Apostle John, on the contrary he has set to it his seal.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.560]   That's his way of authenticating and saying that it is true. So it does
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   authenticate and certify. But of course a seal was used and still is used in a
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:57.440]   slightly different way and that is to indicate ownership, to indicate property.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.840]   You put your seal on a packet and thereby it is known that it is you a
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.920]   packet. You deposit a thing in a bank or a safe deposit and they generally do put
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.000]   some sealing wax on it and you write your signature across it. It's a seal
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.960]   that it's your property and nobody is to open that but yourself. So a seal is used
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.880]   in that way. And thirdly, and I've already partly hinted at it in what I've just
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:35.720]   said, it does also render whatever is sealed in this way secure. It's a form of
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.800]   safeguarding security and nobody can interfere with it. The seal mustn't be
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.920]   broken and the proof that the custodians can afford us when we go there to get
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.520]   our property is that it hasn't been tempered with is that the seal is still
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.200]   intact. So it is for the purposes of security. Now there can be no doubt at
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.600]   all but that the specific teaching of these three portions of Scripture which
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.040]   we're looking at together very definitely teach that with regard to the
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.960]   Holy Spirit in the believer. First and foremost therefore the Holy Spirit
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   himself remember is the authentication or the certification of the fact that
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.600]   we are indeed God's people. The Scriptures talk about our being God's
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.000]   own peculiar possession translated in the authorized version as a peculiar
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.960]   people. What it means is a people for his own peculiar possession. You'll find that
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.360]   in the first epistle of Peter second chapter verses 9 and 10 and in other
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.680]   places. Separate unto himself a peculiar people again we read in the second
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.200]   chapter of Titus same thing people for a peculiar possession. The Christian in
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:08.920]   other words is someone who has been chosen by God. The claim made for him is
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.720]   that God has set him apart and has granted unto him all these blessings
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.120]   that he's a unique person. Well what is the authentication for that? The answer
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.600]   is the gift of the Holy Spirit. Now I think that it's very important for us to
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.400]   work that out in this way. Now this is surely something that should be not only
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.480]   evident to us but should also be evident to other people. It is the way of
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.440]   authenticating the fact that we are Christians to others. Now this becomes
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   obviously important from a very practical standpoint. It is the presence
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.960]   of the Holy Spirit in us producing the fruit of the Spirit that certifies to
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.760]   other people that we really are Christians. Now it's it's possible for a
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.240]   man to make a profession of Christianity. It is possible for us to give a mental
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.400]   or an intellectual assent to the truth and to certain propositions and
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.840]   teachings of Scripture. But merely to do that doesn't prove that one is of
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:23.320]   necessity a Christian. But the presence of the Holy Spirit in us is proof of
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.560]   this. Because when he is present it means that God through Christ has given him to
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.680]   us. He has been sent to us and therefore he has been given to us and is resident
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.720]   within us and working within us because we are God's people. He is not given to
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.240]   anybody else. He's not given to the world. Our Lord himself taught the disciples
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:56.480]   that before his death he is only given to those who belong to God. Well therefore I
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:03.440]   argue that the Holy Spirit as a seal manifests the fact to others as well as
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.400]   to ourselves that we are Christian people. But then going on to the second
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:18.640]   meaning of this term. This second idea of property is something that speaks very
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   particularly to us ourselves. In the same way it does make the proclamation to all
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.760]   and there remember it's interesting to read what you'll find as the message to
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.040]   the Church of Philadelphia in the third chapter of the book of Revelations
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.360]   where you read about this new name and so on. It's part of the same thing
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.120]   undoubtedly put in a slightly different way. Now here I say especially though the
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:57.160]   message comes to us and the Holy Spirit is the guarantee to us that we really
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.400]   are God's people and God's property. That is if you like another way of talking
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.320]   about the assurance of salvation. And you remember that when we were dealing with
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.800]   that particular aspect of the truth we were at great pains to emphasize this
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.000]   that a part of our assurance and in my opinion the most important part of the
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.440]   assurance of salvation is the testimony of the Spirit with our spirits that we
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.280]   are the children of God. Now let me go back to that and put it like this
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.440]   because I do feel it's very important. There is a tendency for people today it
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   seems to me in teaching assurance to forget that. And they teach assurance in
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.160]   some such way as this. They are trying to help somebody to arrive at assurance and
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.920]   they say now come along do you believe the scripture to be the Word of God? Yes
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.320]   as the person I do. Well they say here is the scripture. God so loved the world
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.960]   that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:09.080]   perish but have everlasting life. He that believeth hath passed so on from death
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.720]   unto life etc. They said you believe that's the Word of God? Yes as the person.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.040]   Well very well they said. There is your proof. The Bible says it if you believe
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.320]   the Bible you've got your assurance. And they tend to stop at that point. Now of
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.480]   course that is a part of it and a very important part of it. We must as I've
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.680]   already quoted set our seal to it that God is true. We must believe the message.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:42.040]   Yes but you see to stop at that is in a sense almost dangerous because it can be
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.960]   something purely intellectual again and quite mechanical. So John in his first
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.280]   epistle gives us certain other tests which we are to apply to ourselves. It
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   isn't enough just that you say that and sort of externally and mechanically
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   accept the scripture. Do you love the brethren? Do you believe that the Lord
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.320]   Jesus Christ is really come in the flesh? And furthermore have you received the
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.480]   Spirit? Those are John's own tests and others which he works out. But I say on
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.640]   top of all this is that tremendously important statement of the Apostle Paul
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   in the eighth chapter of Romans, "The Spirit beareth witness with our spirit
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:35.360]   that we are the children of God." That's the ultimate ground of assurance. In my
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.400]   own spirit I'm assured of my salvation. I believe the scripture. I am able to
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.080]   detect these evidences of the Spirit in me as I read the first epistle of John. I
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.320]   reason all that. I apply all that. That's all something that I do and my spirit
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.040]   has got this assurance. Oh but the final thing that clinches it and makes it
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:04.920]   beyond any doubt is this, that the Holy Spirit himself beareth witness with my
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.800]   spirit that I am. How does he do it? Well one of the ways in which he does it is
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.680]   to do what we were talking about last Friday evening. And as you remember the
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.040]   Puritan John Flavel put it, he said that he learned more of this precious truth
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.000]   in those hours when he was there not knowing whether he was in the body or
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   out of it than he'd done in all his years of reading and of study. When the
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.640]   Lord Jesus Christ was made real to him in that astounding way that he there
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.480]   described. That's the ultimate authentication, the Spirit bearing
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.340]   witness with our spirit. It needn't always be as dramatic as that but it is
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.520]   something which cannot in a sense be put into words but we are conscious that it
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.840]   is the Holy Spirit himself witnessing to and with our spirits that we are the
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.680]   children of God. Well very well then there is how we know that we are the
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:12.160]   property of God. And then the third thing is as I say it it makes it all secure to
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:19.440]   us. And this is a very wonderful thought that the fact that we know that the Holy
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:27.800]   Spirit is in us is a guarantee of our ultimate salvation perfectly. I mean by
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.920]   that what the scriptures often describe under the term redemption. He of God is
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.360]   made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption. That means
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:45.320]   the ultimate consummation including glorification itself. We says the Apostle
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.640]   Paul in the eighth of Romans again are waiting for the adoption to wit the
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.800]   redemption of our bodies. That's something that's yet to come. The
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   redemption is the complete final salvation when we shall be perfect in
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.520]   body as well as in spirit the entire the whole man. Now then the fact that we are
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:16.160]   sealed by the Holy Spirit is a guarantee that that is going to happen to us. God
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.360]   has given us this guarantee. He's put the seal of the Spirit, the Spirit as the
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.320]   seal on us and in us in order that we may have this blessed certainty and
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.760]   assurance that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.440]   nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:44.560]   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.680]   Jesus our Lord. There's no such thing as falling from grace in that ultimate
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.120]   sense. If you have the Holy Spirit, if you receive the Spirit, He is an absolute
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   guarantee of your final perseverance, your ultimate security and there is
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.960]   nothing and no one that can pluck us out of the hands of God. But it's the
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:18.240]   presence of the Holy Spirit within us as a seal that is that guarantee to us. Now
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.400]   I mustn't stay too long with this but I am stressing it and emphasizing it
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:33.000]   partly for this reason that reading the other day a book not long published in
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   the United States on this doctrine of the Holy Spirit which to me is one of
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.160]   the best and the fullest treatments of this subject that I've seen for many a
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.400]   long day and which in many ways comes very near to being as good as that great
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:57.320]   work by the Dutch theologian Abram Kuyper. But reading this I say I noticed
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.400]   this that in dealing with the this aspect of the doctrine of the Holy
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.240]   Spirit namely the sealing with the Spirit he actually says that this is not
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:13.040]   something experimental. He says it is something that we've got to believe and
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   to accept by faith. He says it's got nothing to do with experience. Now I find
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.880]   it rather difficult to tell whether he means by that simply that it isn't some
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:32.040]   extra or special experience. If he means that I agree with him but if he doesn't
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.680]   mean that and he certainly doesn't make it very plain and clear well then I
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.920]   would totally disagree with him and not only that I would say that he is saying
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   something that is extremely dangerous. But there is a tendency is there not in
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.160]   presenting the doctrine of the Holy Spirit today to use that kind of
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:55.080]   language. As I was saying last Friday night we are all so terrified of
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:01.440]   excesses, we are all so alarmed at the possibility of emotionalism, we are all
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.160]   so terrified lest anybody would think that we suddenly have ceased to be
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.960]   intellectual and that we've abandoned ourselves to some kind of ecstasy. That
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   it seems to me we come perilously near being guilty of what is described as
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:25.280]   quenching the spirit. My friends how can the Holy Spirit be a seal if you don't
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   know it experimentally? How can it be of value as a seal to you and to me if it's
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   only something that I have to accept and believe by faith with the experimental
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.720]   aspect entirely absent. But you're familiar with that kind of teaching. We
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.200]   are told to accept our sanctification like that. Don't worry about your
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.560]   feelings they say. You just believe it, you accept it by faith. So I'm told to
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.360]   accept the sealing of the spirit in the same way. Nothing at all to do with my
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.040]   experience, nothing experiential I'm told, all by faith. In other words I really
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.600]   don't know but I believe the scripture and therefore I believe that I'm sealed.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.760]   But the whole point of the seal according to the teaching of the
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.060]   scripture is that I may know this, that I may enjoy this, that I may have the
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:20.360]   assurance and that I may have this blessed security of my ultimate complete
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:26.240]   redemption and perfection. Well very well there is something at any rate on this
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.120]   teaching concerning the sealing of the spirit. But with this is coupled another
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:40.040]   which is the earnest of the spirit. Now you noticed this didn't you? In portions
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:46.560]   I've already read. Here again I can't but pass on a piece of information. I read a
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.640]   book, a part of a book which has very recently been published on this subject
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.280]   and in that book I read that there are only two references in the scripture to
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:03.360]   the earnest of the spirit. And of course the answer is that there are three. But
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.440]   writers of books tend to repeat what other writers of books have said and I
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.880]   noticed that several say that there are only two references. It's almost
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.840]   incredible. Now the first is in 2 Corinthians 1 22, "who hath also sealed us
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.240]   and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts." Then the second one which
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.780]   they all quote is of course Ephesians 1 14. A most important statement let me
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:36.200]   read it to you fully. "In whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.500]   truth the gospel of your salvation. In whom also after that he believed he was
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.040]   sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.720]   until the redemption of the purchased possession and to the praise of his
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   glory." Those are the two references in the books but there is a third and that
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:07.920]   is in 2 Corinthians 5 5 which reads like this, "Now he that hath wrought us for the
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:16.200]   selfsame thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit."
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.880]   You remember the connection don't you? "If we know that if our earthly house of
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.320]   this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.400]   hens eternal in the heavens." This blessed assurance again that if the
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.920]   whole creation and our bodies dissolve and collapse we are all right and how do
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.520]   we know that? Well he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God. Well
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.360]   that's good but it's still more. "Who hath also given us the earnest of the spirit."
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.080]   So there are your three references. Now what does the scripture
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.240]   mean by talking about the earnest of the spirit? Well it's perfectly plain isn't
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:05.880]   it? An earnest is a part of the price that you pay for anything. When you go
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   and buy something you put down a deposit. That's the earnest. It means that you are
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.880]   contracting there that you'll pay the rest. You're putting this down on account
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.600]   it's a first installment. It's paid as a kind of security. You say because I'm
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.200]   paying this I'm going to pay the rest. That's an earnest. In the same way
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.720]   therefore it's not only a first installment but it is also a pledge. It is
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.840]   a pledge that you're going to do this and that you're going to follow on what
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.560]   you've already done with something more. Now this is surely one of the most
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.760]   glorious things that is taught anywhere in the scripture. And the teaching is
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:55.120]   that God again has given us the Holy Spirit in that way. As an earnest. If you
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.280]   like as a first installment. Yes let's use the language which the Apostle Paul
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:08.840]   uses in Romans 8 23. He says that even we ourselves which have received the first
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:15.120]   fruits of the Spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:22.880]   adoption to wit the redemption of our body. It's the same idea. The Holy Spirit
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:29.960]   therefore has been given to us by God in order that we might have some kind of an
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.560]   idea as to what awaits us when we arrive in glory. God has given us the first
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.720]   fruits. You remember how the ancient people used to do. They had a festival in
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.760]   connection with the first fruits. The first beginning of the harvest. Just
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.580]   something to taste. Something to assure you of what's coming. The first fruit. The
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.040]   first. The foretaste. Now there's something very wonderful about all this.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:02.740]   And that is the function of the Holy Spirit in this respect. Now you see the
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:10.960]   importance of this further term. The term earnest in the two quotations in the
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.300]   scripture which are always remembered is combined with the word pledge. The word
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.720]   pledge or seal is not actually used in that 2 Corinthians 5 5. But as I've
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.400]   shown you the whole context is saying it. Now it's interesting that these two
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.040]   ideas go together. And you see how important it was that I should have
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.160]   emphasized what I was saying about the seal of the Spirit. You notice how Paul
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.440]   puts it here in first Ephesians. We are told that in whom also after that he
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.400]   believed he were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is that earnest
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:55.320]   or the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.960]   possession. In other words our salvation isn't complete in this world but it's
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.280]   going to be complete. But we are given the Spirit in order that we might not
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.440]   only know that for certain but that we might even begin to experience it. And
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.400]   all we experience in this life in a spiritual sense is but a first fruit or
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:22.080]   a foretaste. Something on account a kind of installment from God in order that we
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:29.520]   may know what is coming for us. Well now obviously if this is not experimental
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.160]   what is the value of it at all? What's the point of the teaching of the Apostle?
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.600]   Surely the whole point of the teaching is to encourage us and to comfort us. He
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.080]   says look here you may be tempted you may find that life is hard and difficult
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.640]   and trying and you may say as the Hebrew Christians were obviously tempted to
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   say well what is there in it after all and here's the answer. What you're
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:01.880]   experiencing already as the result of the Spirit is but a foretaste. It's but a
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:09.640]   sample the kind of first fruits of the tremendous heritage that God has got
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.720]   preparing for you. "I have not seen nor heard neither has entered into the heart
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:21.760]   of men the things which God has prepared for them that love him." But these things
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:28.720]   have been revealed unto us by the Spirit we know. "For the Spirit such as all
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.420]   things even the deep things of God we have not received says the Apostle the
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.960]   Spirit that is of the world but the Spirit that is of God that we might know
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.800]   the things that are freely given to us of God. There's the seal says the Apostle
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.720]   which is incidentally also the earnest the two things go together. So if I'm
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.560]   to accept the seal by faith outside my experience well I suppose I do the same
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:02.880]   with the earnest and I've no comfort at all. How tragic it is that in our fear of
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.120]   the extravagances and excesses we should even have to go to that length and to
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:15.280]   that extent of really denying the plain teaching of the scripture. So again my
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.840]   friends I don't hesitate to put this question. Do you know that you have
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:28.120]   received the Spirit? I'm not asking you whether you believe by faith that the
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.400]   Spirit is in you. I am arguing again on the basis of scripture that when the
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   Holy Spirit is in us we can't help knowing it. His presence will be felt. His
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.560]   presence is felt and as he works within us warning us urging us forward
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.400]   enlightening us we are aware of these things and as he gives us those seasons
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.240]   of special blessing as he moves our heart and gives us glimpses of our Lord
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.720]   we know it and we rejoice in it. Our hearts are moved. It is experimental and
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:06.600]   the emotions must be involved. The whole man is involved. The mind, the heart and
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:13.120]   the will. So it isn't some extravagant ecstasy. No no a true experience of the
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   Holy Spirit leads to conduct and behavior and action. The will and the
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.240]   intellect and the heart but let us not leave any one of them out and let's
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.840]   never imagine that we're being unusually spiritual because we can say I felt
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.760]   nothing. There was no feeling there but I went on in faith. My friend you should
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:38.120]   feel and I would say again that unless the Holy Spirit has moved you and unless
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.440]   you know what it is to desire to sing and to praise God and to burst forth
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.280]   into these hymns with the Apostle well you should be ashamed of yourself as a
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.320]   Christian and you should seek that knowledge which will lead you to sing
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.280]   and to praise and to make melody with other Christians in your heart to God
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:07.400]   for his wonderful salvation. Have you tasted of the heavenly gift? Have you
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.440]   known something of the foretaste and the first fruits? Do you know already
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:20.600]   something of the joy that is going to be yours unmixed and without limit when you
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.560]   find yourself in glory? Those it seems to me are the inevitable lessons from a
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.080]   consideration of the biblical teaching with regard to the Holy Spirit as a seal
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:40.400]   and as an earnest. Let me be still more practical. How are we to enjoy these
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.840]   things? If I'm speaking to somebody who says well I don't know much of what
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.960]   you're talking about but I'd like to. Well the instruction is perfectly clear
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   here are the further terms. There are certain things we must avoid doing. The
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:02.640]   first is we must avoid quenching the spirit. In 1 Thessalonians 5 19 you read
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:11.160]   those words quench not the spirit. What does this mean? Well I think that this is
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.840]   something that should be interpreted very carefully and taken in its context
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:22.640]   and the context is something like this rejoice evermore pray without ceasing
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.120]   in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.440]   concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:42.360]   hold fast that which is good. What's it mean? Well we all know what to quench is
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:52.280]   it's to put a damper on to fight against to discourage. Now quenching the spirit
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:31:00.000]   is something our less which we all must know something about in experience. It
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.920]   means that you tend to argue with the leading instead of responding. It means
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.080]   that you put up your questions and your queries and it's not only something that
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.360]   can be done in private it can be done in a in a gathering it can be done in a
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.560]   church service it can be done in any fellowship of Christian people. Again you
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.360]   see this terrible fear comes in of that which is wrong and it is right to be
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.680]   fearful of that which is wrong because here you notice in the very context I am
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:36.000]   told at one and the same time not to quench the spirit but I am also told to
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.680]   prove all things and only to hold fast to that which is good. You see there are
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.280]   some people who think that to avoid quenching the spirit the thing you have
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   to do is is to put your intellect out of action. You stop thinking you stop
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.080]   examining you just let yourself go and you're carried away and the more you're
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.960]   carried away the more certain you are that you haven't been quenching the
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:02.280]   spirit but that's unscriptural. While you are not to quench the spirit you are
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   also to prove all things and there are certain things that the evil spirits
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.800]   might suggest to us as being the actions of the Holy Spirit which are condemned
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.240]   in the scripture and we prove them by the scripture. So if you find you have
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:24.400]   an impulse or feel moved to do something which is prohibited in the scripture
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.480]   you can be certain it isn't the leading of the Holy Spirit. You take the word and
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.600]   the spirit you must be very careful not to quench the spirit you mustn't go
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.280]   beyond the teaching of the scripture in that respect but you must always at one
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.040]   of the same time be open be sensitive and yet you must be scriptural you must
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.720]   realize that there are evil spirits you must prove the spirits you must test the
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:55.280]   spirits for every spirit is not of God there is a spirit of Antichrist there is
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.200]   an evil spirit abroad in the world and we must be careful he can transform
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.580]   himself into an angel of light he can be so marvelous as honest to deceive the
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:10.640]   very elect says the Son of God himself. So there we are as Christians we mustn't
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:18.400]   quench but at the same time we mustn't abandon ourselves without thought and
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.560]   without discrimination and without scrutiny to these other powers that may
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:29.360]   be seeking to control us but with the word and the spirit this is gloriously
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.560]   possible and indeed it isn't even difficult. Well very well then there's
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.360]   one thing we have to avoid quenching the spirit the other thing we have to avoid
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:46.200]   is what is called grieving the spirit and you notice that it was mentioned in
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:52.320]   the fourth chapter of Ephesians verse 30 grieve not the Spirit of God grieve not
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:01.520]   the Holy Spirit of God whereby we are sealed until the day of redemption. I
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.240]   needn't keep you with this there are many ways in which we can grieve the
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:15.440]   Spirit they're obvious aren't they? To forget him and to ignore him to neglect
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   his word in particular doubt and unbelief concerning him and his purposes
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   and his desires for us the assertion of self in every form he wants to control
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.040]   us and if we want to control ourselves we grieve him sin of course in every
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:41.160]   form it doesn't matter what form any sin grieves him the very term suggests how
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:48.280]   sensitive the Holy Spirit is he's holy he's compared to a dove and he is
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.520]   sensitive and we can grieve him failure to do his will after he's made it clear
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   therefore grieves him to be more interested in experiences and gifts and
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:03.160]   power rather than in him obviously grieves him there is nothing more
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.880]   insulting you can do to a person than to give that person the impression that
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.160]   you're really not interested in him or in her but in simply what you can get
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.680]   out of him or her there is no greater insult you can ever offer to a person
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.120]   it's very grievous and we tend to do that we want an experience so we want
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.400]   power and we give the impression we don't want him and that is grieving
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:31.080]   indeed I can sum it up by saying that any respect in which the Lord Jesus
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:37.280]   Christ is not at the center and our all and in all is grievous to the Spirit he
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:44.480]   has come to glorify him and any failure in our part to do that is grievous to
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:51.200]   the Spirit so we must not quench the Spirit and we must not grieve the Holy
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:59.160]   Spirit let's be clear about this we are not told that if we do grieve him that
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:06.120]   he will leave us thank God we are not told that but we are not told that we
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:12.440]   are told that he's still there but we are grieving him the little child that
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.480]   grieves his mother or his father doesn't find that the father or mother
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.040]   abandons him and ceases to have any interest in him or any concern no no the
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.760]   father or the mother is grieved by the action of the child but the relationship
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.320]   is not broken and the parent doesn't go away and leave the child to fight its
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.960]   own battle and to get on as best it can in this world thank God it isn't so but
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:45.920]   though grieved he remains but he remains grieved well now says the Apostle and
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.520]   that's the whole context and if you go on to the fifth chapter of Ephesians
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.840]   where you remember we saw that he teaches us to be filled with the Spirit
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.240]   it's all surrounded by the most practical exhortations he tells us not
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:06.400]   to steal and not to be guilty of foolish jesting and talking that no evil
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   communications must come out of our mouths we must be kind and tender-hearted
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.640]   and gentle and so on by failing to do all these things we are grieving the
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.920]   Spirit read Ephesians 4 and 5 and there you will be told very clearly what you
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.240]   have to avoid in order not to grieve or quench the Spirit or to put it
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:34.520]   positively we can put it like this we must be led by the Spirit we must walk
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.600]   in the Spirit and what does that mean well it really means this doesn't it
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   that we realize the relationship that subsists between us and that we must
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.000]   live our lives and walk through this world as realizing that we are in the
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.760]   presence of the Spirit that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost in fact
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.160]   and that he's always with us and we must be ready to follow his injunctions we
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.720]   must be ready to listen to him we must be ready to do what he prompts us to do
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.280]   and what he leads us to do he always wants us to read the Scripture it's his
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.120]   word it's the way that he uses in order to build us up that we may grow in grace
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.880]   and in the knowledge of the Lord and if we refuse to do that we again are not
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:27.320]   being led by him and we are grieving him but if we listen to him we will come to
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.360]   the word and we'll study it and we'll meditate upon it and we'll pray over it
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.800]   and he leads us to prayer he's there prompting us he's working in us both to
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:46.880]   will and to do and as we realize that and respond to it we shall find more and
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:56.600]   more that we know that we have been sealed by the Spirit and that the Spirit
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:04.920]   is indeed the earnest of our inheritance that amazing thing which I come back to
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:11.520]   again as I close that God as it were having purchased us by the precious
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:20.240]   blood of Christ gives us that kind of title deed he gives us that earnest he
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.840]   says here you are this is a proof of it you'll experience this now but it's
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:33.080]   nothing in comparison with what you're going to experience when this purchased
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:41.840]   possession is finally and fully redeemed that's it and if we only look at these
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:48.880]   things in that way we shall go on our way rejoicing and not only shall we not
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:57.560]   quench or grieve the Spirit but we shall enjoy his holy presence and above all we
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:05.120]   shall know the Lord more and more and better and better and our love for him
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:12.160]   will become greater and greater I end with it because that is always the
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:20.000]   ultimate test of the reality of the work of the Spirit and our possession of the
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.120]   Spirit the test the final test the certain test always is not what I felt
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:36.160]   is not some thrill I've had it is my relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ my
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:45.760]   love for him especially my knowledge of him and the reality of my relationship
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:56.680]   to him let us pray Oh Lord our God we again know not what to say nor how to
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:05.480]   thank thee as we consider the greatness of thy love toward us and as we see the
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.320]   trouble that thou dost take with us and all the encouragement thou dost give us
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:18.400]   while yet we are in this world and in this life Oh God we thank thee that we
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:27.880]   are thy workmanship and that the work is so glorious and so perfect Oh God wilt
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:34.520]   thou grant unto us all to know these things more deeply than we have ever
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:43.600]   known them hitherto grant that we all may know the sealing and the earnest of
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.640]   the Spirit with a greater reality and a greater depth than we have ever known
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   before we ask this not only that we may rejoice but we ask it Oh God that others
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:05.280]   may see it that they may know unmistakably that we are thy people the
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:12.360]   people whom thou hast purchased to be thine own peculiar possession Oh God
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:19.720]   hear us and answer us according to thine own riches in glory and now may the
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:26.160]   grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.920]   communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.200]   throughout the remainder of this our short and certain life and earthly
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:47.760]   pilgrimage and until the redemption of the purchased possession we do hope that
