[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.340]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.380]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.380]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.760]   I'm your host.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.860]   Today on the show, I want to talk about belief.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.540]   The power of believing in the possibilities of what is actually in front of you.
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.340]   I've been thinking this morning about the war in Ukraine right now between Russia and
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.340]   Ukraine.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.500]   For context, today is Thursday, February 24, 2022.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.780]   In the last 12 to 18 hours, there has been a dramatic change in the relationship between
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020]   Russia and Ukraine.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.220]   The conflict has now gone kinetic.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.940]   It's hard for me to understand fully at the moment in the fog of war what's actually happening,
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.740]   but there are abundant reports of Russian attacks on Ukraine.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.380]   There's plenty of evidence of incursions of Russian tanks, troop carriers, et cetera,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.860]   across the border.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.780]   There's a massive breakdown in international relations.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.100]   Ukraine has closed its embassy in Moscow, cut off diplomatic relations with Russia.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.700]   Around the world, many nation states are issuing strong condemnations of the actions of Russia,
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   et cetera.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.900]   Clearly, we have entered a new phase of this particular conflict.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.140]   This is something that's actually come up on Radical Personal Finance in the past few
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.340]   weeks, which I'll be talking about in a moment, where we had a listener call in and said,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.740]   "Hey, my parents are in Ukraine.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.740]   What should we do?
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.740]   Should we get them out?
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.740]   Should we not?"
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740]   We'll be talking about this.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.780]   But as I consider the topic and what I wanted to say about the topic, I believe it's a useful
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.980]   learning point for us.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.780]   And I don't have any insight or wish to make any commentary on the actual details on the
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.780]   ground.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.780]   It's unknown.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.940]   I want to always condemn violence, immoral violence.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.620]   I always want to condemn immoral violence.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220]   I always want to stand for peace and for righteousness.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.760]   And so that should be the first thing, of course.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.260]   But beyond that, I don't have any insight.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.140]   And so I'm not going to make any commentary on Russia or Ukraine or anything.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.420]   I don't understand the history.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.140]   I don't understand that region of the world.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.660]   I don't understand.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.740]   And that lack of understanding goes deep.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.220]   Two in passing, it's interesting, two things that have troubled me for years.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.980]   About a decade ago, I started to take some interest in the Soviet Union and the history
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   of the Soviet Union.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.220]   Because, of course, I had what I was taught in school as history.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.100]   And I grew up, when I was a young boy, I grew up and I took an interest in political thrillers,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.820]   primarily Tom Clancy political thrillers.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.580]   And a key part of the story arc of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series involved the conflict between
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.140]   the Soviet Union and the United States.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.140]   Of course, that was the defining feature of that age in American politics and American
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.340]   international relationships, was the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States.
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.260]   And a bunch of Clancy's thrillers were set in that age of conflict.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.860]   Of course, there's the famous Hunt for Red October.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.020]   But then he had many lesser known books, such as The Cardinal, The Kremlin, and others that
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.300]   were situated in the Soviet Union.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.280]   And so, of course, I had kind of the standard American viewpoint of that, reinforced by
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.820]   what I learned in school.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.660]   And then, probably 10 to 15 years ago, I don't remember exactly, I started, I came across
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.980]   the research of Anthony Sutton on the technological influences in the Soviet Union.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.340]   And Sutton was a, I think, a professor who was very, who did a very detailed analysis
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.780]   of what technology was in the Soviet Union.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.340]   And it opened my eyes to the revisionist history that many people had argued with regard to
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.340]   the Soviet Union.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.340]   It left me very confused.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.900]   I thought, how on earth is it the case that there's all this hard evidence for the American
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.020]   investment in the Soviet Union, the building up of the Soviet Union?
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.540]   And yet, this is not, I don't understand how this could be the case, because this doesn't
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.380]   fit the standard history that I was taught.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.100]   And so I've had an interest in that for years, but never pursued it to a point of trying
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.500]   to actually have an opinion on it.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.780]   Second thing that happened was actually the YouTube algorithm started to affect me, I
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.660]   guess, a couple year or two ago.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.980]   I stumbled across some videos of President Putin of Russia.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.300]   And I started watching videos of his speeches, some interviews, etc.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.180]   And some of them were quite, some of them were just public speeches, some of them were
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.260]   interviews, some of them were aggressive, confrontational interviews.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.180]   And of course, when you start watching something on YouTube, then of course, there's up next.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.100]   And you train the algorithm, the algorithm sees you're interested in this, and you watch
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.420]   these videos.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.420]   And I kept watching them.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.220]   And I've watched a couple dozen videos, some fairly long of President Putin in various
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.820]   public contexts.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.380]   And I came away saying, that is not a stupid man, whatever he is, he may be evil, may not
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.120]   be evil, I don't know.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.380]   But that is not a stupid man.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.500]   And it was interesting, because I came away with a very different impression of him from
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.820]   actually watching just the way that he dealt with public events than I had from absorbing
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.540]   the American news media.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.540]   I read mainstream American news media regularly, on an almost daily basis, read the Wall Street
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.020]   Journal, New York Times, etc.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.660]   And you get this certain impression of the world based upon reading mainstream news.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.140]   And that impression doesn't hold up to my understanding of just trying to watch direct
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.140]   from the source.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.420]   So forgive the sideline, just all that to say that I don't understand what's going on,
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.380]   and so I don't want to comment on that.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.540]   I don't want to comment on what is actually happening, etc. until more information becomes
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.500]   clear, except to the point that I want to condemn violence, and those who perpetuate
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   violence.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.340]   Violence doesn't solve anything.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.400]   Or at least, it very rarely solves anything.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.140]   But there's a long history there that is very difficult to understand for me.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.820]   What is not difficult to understand is that the lives of Russians and Ukrainians have
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.900]   been dramatically affected in the last 12 to 24 hours.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.940]   And it's the lives of all Russians and all Ukrainians.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:33.000]   Secondly, there is the risks and the fears of violence.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.160]   Obviously the Ukrainian people all across the country are now facing risks of violence
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.640]   that they weren't facing a couple of months ago.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.560]   You have air raid sirens going off in major cities, you have shelling coming in, you have
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.540]   tanks driving down the street.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.520]   These are major, major changes in life.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:08:01.280]   At this point in time, although of course I'm sure that the Russian desire is not to
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.960]   kill thousands and thousands of ordinary civilians, that would seem to me from my limited understanding
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:15.000]   quite counterproductive for them, the fact is that when violence happens, the results
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.960]   are often uncontainable.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.500]   When a gun goes off, a bullet lands somewhere.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.760]   And sometimes that bullet lands in the intended target, sometimes it passes through the intended
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.540]   target and hits someone behind, sometimes it goes crazy, flies up in the air, falls
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.640]   down and kills a random kid.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.960]   There was a horrible story the last couple of days, the five-year-old shot in, I think
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.360]   it was Detroit, I think.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:49.680]   So the point is that any time you have violence, there's always unintended consequences, there's
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.840]   always collateral damage.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.180]   And so regardless of what a military tries to do or tries not to do, it's a dangerous
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.400]   place to be.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:09.280]   So the life of every Ukrainian in Ukraine is now affected just simply by that increasing
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   risk.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.600]   What will happen is in a time of war and violence, the risks across the board go up.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.040]   You have always primary effects, secondary effects, tertiary effects.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.480]   You have the primary risk of a shell coming in, a warplane going over, a tank lobbing
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.440]   off some kind of explosive round, people being killed, people being shot.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:39.160]   Then you have the secondary risk that now local criminals will have more freedom to
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.880]   engage in higher levels of crime.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   So you have your more standard criminals that use the cover of violence to engage in other
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   levels of crime.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.280]   Then you have, of course, all the secondary and tertiary effects of disruptions in markets,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.880]   disruptions in goods.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.120]   Right now the international airport is shut down.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   Across the country, international airports are shut down.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.600]   So of course, there's nobody coming in, there's nobody going out, there's no tourists coming
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.000]   in, no tourists going out.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.960]   There'll be blockades of supply lines.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.640]   The grocery store shelves will start to run short.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.160]   Prices will skyrocket on certain goods that are hard to get.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   There'll be shortages across the board.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.640]   And so everyone in Ukraine is going to be feeling the effects.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.240]   However far it goes, whatever ends up happening, the effects are going to last and be very,
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.280]   very significant for a significant period of time.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.080]   And then everybody in Russia or everybody associated with Russia in any way is going
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   to be affected.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.360]   They're going to have significant international sanctions, most of them being economic sanctions
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.680]   being levied against the Russian people.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.260]   We'll see what the long-term impact of those sanctions is, but they will be heavy on anybody
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.000]   associated with Russia.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.760]   Businesses in Russia are being sanctioned.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.000]   Businesses doing business with Russia are being sanctioned.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.080]   If you're running a company in the United States but you have Russian clients, that
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.920]   will come under heavy problems.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.240]   Russians' ability to convert money, to transfer money, people are arguing cut them off of
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.720]   the swift banking system.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.640]   Russian banks will undergo greater scrutiny.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   You're stuck, right?
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.120]   It's a major problem.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.240]   So you could be Russian, living in Russia or not living in Russia, and now at this point
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.280]   in time, because of the actions of the Russian government and the Russian military, there
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.440]   will now be major, major effects that will be felt by you.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.200]   Now what do I talk about belief?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:43.280]   The point is, I didn't think a few weeks ago, I didn't think it was likely that President
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.920]   Putin would actually invade Ukraine.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.360]   The topic came up on a Friday Q&A show and I had been reading some of the news reports,
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.080]   but I have a very hard time reading and believing anything that I read in the news reports about
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.520]   things like that.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.640]   Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't, but the Western media is so wacky in
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.040]   terms of the things that they report, I believe very little of it.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:14.520]   And you look at it and you say, "What does a country like Russia have to gain by invading
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   Ukraine?"
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.760]   It seems to me how, based upon my understanding of the conflict, the cultural differences,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.960]   the nationalism of the Ukrainian people, the nationalism of the Russian people, obviously
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.920]   there are close, close connections and ties, culturally speaking, but it just seemed to
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:41.240]   me like you can't, it seems, I don't understand how a nation can militarily pacify another
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.520]   nation.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.800]   And so we'll see how far Putin goes and what happens, we'll see what his game plan is,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:55.720]   but in the modern age it has seemed, I don't understand how it can be smart, a smart thing
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.920]   to do.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.640]   But time will tell, history will give the verdict.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.880]   In a couple decades we'll have a greater understanding of what the impact of the actions
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.720]   today are or are not.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:15.920]   But what I have done, I didn't think it would happen, but I have always believed that it
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   could happen.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.980]   And so if you think back to the Friday Q&A shows where I had a listener with Ukrainian
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.960]   roots calling in and saying, "Should I get my parents out?"
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   My answer was, "Absolutely, get your parents out."
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.480]   And we talked through some of the details, but I said, "If you think that it's a possibility,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.800]   the consequences of not getting out are simply too high."
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.920]   And so I hope very much that that listener got his parents out, I hope that they went
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.560]   to the United States and that they're safe in the United States at the moment.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.000]   The consequences of being, there are certain things where the price is so high and the
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.600]   consequences are so high that regardless of whether you know what will happen, regardless
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.200]   of whether you're sure of what will happen, you must take action just in case something
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.680]   does happen.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.000]   And you must take action early and put a plan in place.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.600]   Again, that plan can have certain triggering points.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.280]   I always think about this in the context in my line of work as a financial planner of
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.920]   what's called a springing trust.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:22.120]   In financial planning, you can build in a trust certain springs, things that if this,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.800]   then that, a trip wire, so to speak, or a conditional clause, right?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.840]   If this happens, then that happens.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:35.480]   And so in asset protection planning, there's a really interesting design that I think is
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   quite smart when it comes to domestic asset protection trusts and offshore asset protection
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.000]   trusts.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.440]   And the basic idea is whenever you do offshore planning, the prices go up, the hassle goes
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.400]   up, the costs go up.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:57.740]   And so a lot of times, you're better off keeping your assets in the local area, in the domestic
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.360]   economy, because prices are lower, hassle is lower, you can, it's just an easier, it's
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.720]   easier to do business.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.880]   It's quite complicated and frustrating to do business offshore, whether that's an offshore
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.680]   company, whether that's an offshore trust, et cetera.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.020]   And there are higher costs associated with those things.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.280]   But you recognize, especially in things like asset protection planning, you recognize that
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.500]   there are certain things that could happen, that if they happen, that might make this
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.320]   line of planning no longer doable.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.760]   So you can build a trust where the trust is managed in the United States, if you're from
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.940]   the United States, its assets are mostly in the United States.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.800]   That keeps your costs low, keeps things simple, et cetera.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.840]   But then you put certain springs in there, where if this happens, if the threat goes
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.720]   up, then the trust, the trustee has the direction to immediately move the trust from the United
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.400]   States to an offshore jurisdiction.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.880]   And then in the offshore jurisdiction, the trust has greater protection from the attacks
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.540]   that it is receiving.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.880]   And so it's called a springing trust, it can spring, something happens.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.040]   And there are other uses of springing trust in other contexts as well.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.800]   But I love that picture, I love that image of simply we have a plan, but then if things
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.120]   get bad, then it springs into another plan.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.440]   Because that's a good way of dealing with reality.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.500]   Reality is, I don't want my trust to go offshore, it's a hassle.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.800]   But I recognize that there are attacks that can come, and that would be, those attacks
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.280]   would be significant.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.880]   The same thing applies to where you are, right?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.160]   If you're living in Ukraine, and you're happy in Ukraine, that's where your life is, that's
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.680]   where your friends are, that's where your business is, that's where everything is, then
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.160]   you would obviously want to stay there.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.640]   That Ukrainian person doesn't want to move to Hawaii, doesn't want to move to Latvia,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.960]   doesn't want to move to Finland or to the United Kingdom.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.200]   The Ukrainian person wants to be in Ukraine.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.560]   But you have to acknowledge there are certain things that could happen that could change
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   that.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.400]   So I put in place a plan to say, if this happens, then I'm going to take these certain actions.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.200]   And I think war is a really good example of this.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   This is one of the reasons why years ago when I left the United States the first time, I
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.760]   said, I need to have a plan to where I could go if I wanted to leave the United States
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   in the future.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.200]   It's not that I want to leave forever, but if I wanted to leave in the future because
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.360]   things got bad, what would I do?
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.380]   What would I do if the tyranny increased?
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:38.040]   What would I do if there broke out increasing levels of violence due to structural instability
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   and social instability, et cetera?
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.880]   I need a plan.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.680]   I need a plan that could spring into action.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.640]   But in order to develop the plan, you have to believe it.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.400]   And then in order to actually take action, you have to believe that something is possible.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.100]   And this is what happens, is that very few of us actually believe that the bad things
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.280]   that could happen to us are possible.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.080]   Think about a heart attack, right?
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.980]   You're 40 years old.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.880]   You're stuffing your face every day with junk food.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.160]   You are sedentary, et cetera.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.340]   You know intellectually that something could happen and your heart could get clogged and
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.700]   you could have a heart attack and die.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.720]   Heart disease kills millions and millions of people.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.600]   You know that it could happen, but you don't believe it.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   You don't believe it.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.880]   And so we don't start doing the things that we need to do to avoid that kind of outcome.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.700]   You know that you could get in a car accident today and die.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:39.180]   You know that your family could be left fatherless, motherless, penniless, but yet you don't believe
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.040]   it enough to go and increase your life insurance.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.940]   You don't believe it.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.280]   You know that war could bring significant disruptions and gasoline could go from $3
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.200]   a gallon to $6 a gallon basically overnight, but you don't believe it enough to prepare,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.020]   enough to stockpile gasoline, stockpile money, make a plan of what you would do if you had
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.000]   to reallocate your budget.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.920]   You know that things could happen and grocery shelves could go bare.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   You know that supply lines could be disrupted, but you don't believe it enough to say, "Oh,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.320]   here's what I would definitely need, so I'll make sure that I have in place some preparations."
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.200]   And when something like this happens, right, I didn't—we don't believe that a nation
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.360]   could go to war with another nation to take territory.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.500]   We ignore the fact that throughout all of human history, this is what people have done.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.080]   This is what governments have done.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:38.920]   It doesn't matter whether it's Genghis Khan or Napoleon or Germany and Hitler, Hitler's
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.600]   Germany, or whether it's Putin's Russia or whether it's the United States.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   It doesn't matter.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.880]   We don't—we ignore the fact that this is the way that it has been throughout all human
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   history.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.520]   And you go through a period of time, right?
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.080]   You go through—let's see, when did the Soviet Union collapse?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.840]   Let's call it almost 30 years.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.880]   You go through a 30-year period and you say, "Oh, we're in a new world order.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.400]   The world is totally different."
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.720]   And then something happens and it should wake you up and you say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.420]   Something could happen."
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.320]   So when you come across a risk, when you come across something that is happening, that could
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.080]   happen, believe that it's possible.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   Right?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   When I did a show last week on Canada about the Canadian government freezing bank accounts,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.440]   which thankfully seems to be coming to an end.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:31.200]   Right now, yesterday, amazingly, before the Senate in Canada actually voted on the act,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.760]   Prime Minister Trudeau ended the Emergency Measures Act.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.320]   So with the ending of the Emergency Measures Act, hopefully the freezing and whatnot is
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   coming to an end.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.600]   I saw several reports of people who had their accounts frozen that they were unfrozen again.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.040]   We'll see what happens.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.200]   But something like that happens and you say, "Ah, I don't believe it could happen here."
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   But you've got to believe it.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.280]   You've got to recognize, "Hey, that happened once.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.960]   If it happened once, it's going to happen again."
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.960]   Right?
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.360]   I did a show this week.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.520]   I didn't release it because I've decided to sit on it for a couple days and I'm going
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.000]   to release it as part of promoting a new course that I'm almost ready to release.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.160]   But I did a show on Executive Order 1602 in the United States back in 1934 when President
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:17.440]   Roosevelt in the United States banned the private ownership of gold coins, gold bullion
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   and gold certificates.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   For 41 years in the United States, it was illegal from 1943 to 1974, it was illegal
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.760]   in the United States for an individual citizen to own gold coins, gold bullion or gold certificates
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.040]   more than I think five ounces.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.100]   We look at that and say, "Oh, that's ancient history.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.640]   They would never ban gold coins again."
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.480]   I think it's unlikely they ban gold coins again because at the time gold was very pervasive.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.280]   But we say, "Oh no, they'll never ban bitcoin."
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.200]   Then we ignore the fact that many of the big countries around the world have tried to ban
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   bitcoin.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:03.080]   Russia just this week I think came out with a proposal that said that if you're going
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.640]   to have bitcoin, you have to have it in a custodian wallet.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.600]   You can't store it yourself in cold storage.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   It has to be with a custodian, right?
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.320]   So they can manipulate them.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.840]   Same thing you see happening in Canada right now.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.680]   Canada can control and affect the use of bitcoin for any bitcoin that is held in a wallet with
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.320]   a custodian because they can impose military power over the custodians, but they can't
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.640]   over cold storage.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.480]   So you look at it and you say, "I don't believe it."
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.520]   Well, my course coming out is about bitcoin is a collaboration I'm doing.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.280]   It's going to be that you need to prepare for the fact that your government says you
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.440]   can't own bitcoin.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.040]   Now do I think that they'll do that?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   I sure hope not.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.440]   They'd be stupid to do it, but they've done it before and all you need to do is look at
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:54.600]   history and recognize they've done this again and again and again from 1934 to 1973 to 1974
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.840]   I think it was.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.560]   It was illegal for you to own a gold coin.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.000]   So why would they not make it illegal for you to own bitcoin?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.040]   Why would they not?
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.800]   Throughout human history, countries have invaded other countries.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.840]   Why would they not do it again?
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.680]   Throughout history, civil wars have broken out all over the planet.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.600]   Why would they not break out again?
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.400]   Throughout history there has been chaos.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.760]   The normal pattern of history is chaos and disorder, violence and conflict.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.560]   So when you have a period of peaceful prosperity you have to look and say, "What created that?
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   What created peace?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.680]   What created harmony?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.720]   What created unity?"
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.160]   Because that's not the norm.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.560]   But in our modern age, many of us come to think that's the norm.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.720]   Now belief is not only on the negative side.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.080]   The same argument can be made on the positive side.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.000]   If you're going to go and start a business you have to believe that success is possible.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.960]   If you're going to enter into a marriage you have to believe that your marriage can be
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.640]   full of love and happy and for life.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.560]   You have to believe that outcomes are possible.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.960]   I'm of course just kind of in a negative mood thinking about the examples in Ukraine today.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.320]   But you have to believe it and then say, "If that did happen what would I want to have
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   in place?"
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.440]   Remember that it's all in your head.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.140]   There's not a cost to believing something.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.720]   There does come certain costs to preparing for certain things.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.500]   Preparedness has certain costs.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.260]   But those costs are usually lower than what people actually think.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.000]   The cost of preparing for, "Hey, what would I do if my country went to war?" is actually
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.840]   pretty low in terms of a most basic plan.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.120]   I have another course that I'm going to be releasing in the next couple of weeks on kind
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.440]   of a springing plan.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.600]   How do you put in place a plan with certain levels?
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.120]   But at its core it's just a matter of, right, our Ukrainian listener on the Q&A show, at
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.400]   its core it's a matter of, "Hey, I was going to go this summer and visit my children in
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   the United States.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.440]   I'm just going to go now and spend a few months there.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.780]   And they can always start any kind of residency process that I need later.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   But let's just go now.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.780]   Why not?
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.780]   Let's go for a few months.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.780]   There's no reason why we can't.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.160]   Not holding down a job, not holding down a business.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.380]   Let's just go now."
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.220]   The cost is relatively low is the point.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.840]   So when you hear of things happening in the world, believe that they can happen to you.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   You hear of a volcano blowing up, if you live near volcanoes don't look at your volcano
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.800]   and say, "Oh, my volcano is dormant."
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.920]   Say, "Hey, those people's volcano was dormant for a long time and then it wasn't.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.800]   What would I do if my volcano became less dormant?"
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.440]   You see of hurricanes going through other places and you live in a place where you get
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.200]   hurricanes, then say, "Hey, what if a hurricane came through here?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   What would I do?
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.880]   What would I do if there were political unrest?
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.600]   What would I do if crime were going up in my neighborhood?"
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.960]   And believe that it's possible where you live.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.520]   You'll just simply believe it.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.160]   Train yourself to believe that it's possible.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.880]   It'll put you far ahead of the people that put their head in the sand and ignore what's
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.680]   happening.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   Believe that it's possible.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.320]   And look at history as your guide.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.840]   A lot of things have happened in the past and then they happen and we say, "Oh, this
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.600]   can't happen."
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.000]   But yet somebody who looked at history realized that it happened again and again and again
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.640]   and again and again.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.840]   Wars have happened again and again and again and again in human history.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.560]   Dictatorships have happened again and again and again and again.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.960]   Believe that it's possible and then make a plan for what you would do if it happened
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   again.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:51.320]   Let's be diligent to pray for and support all of those in this new area of conflict.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.000]   Pray that peace would prevail.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Pray that God would arrest the hearts of dictators, of people committed to war and violence, and
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.560]   turn them from their wicked and evil ways.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.880]   And yet, let's also learn from the lessons that we see happening right now.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.600]   Hey, parents.
