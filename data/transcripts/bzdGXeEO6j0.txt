[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   Podcast listener Derek from Toronto, Canada writes in to ask, "Pastor John,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.560]   what does it mean to be in the presence of God? Not eternally in heaven, but living in his presence right now?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.520]   I'm struck by Psalm 21 verse 6, which says, "You make glad with the joy of your presence."
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.920]   So if God is omnipresent, what does this mean to be in God's presence now?
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.040]   I think the first thing I should say is that the biblical writers were not naive
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.600]   in the sense that they thought God had a body with spatial dimensions so that he could have a locality
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:59.440]   in the universe. Stephen said in Acts 7, "The Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands."
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.840]   The point being, he's not that kind of being. Therefore, I think all the biblical imagery
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:20.160]   about drawing near to God or departing from God or being before the face of God, which is, by the way,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.840]   the literal translation of presence. The word presence is almost always translating the
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:37.120]   Hebrew "pane" or "paneem" and means face. I think all of those images are metaphors or pictures,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   and I'll mention what they're metaphors of in just a minute, but let me stick in a qualifier
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.800]   perhaps first. To be sure, God ordained in the Old Testament that his "presence" be directly
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.280]   associated with the tabernacle in the wilderness or the temple in Jerusalem so that people could
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.040]   speak of entering into God's presence in the sense that they came near to the place where
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.760]   he had appointed his name especially to dwell or to be identified with. And in the New Testament,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   with the coming of Jesus into the world, we now have God in human flesh, which does have spatial
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.040]   dimension, and we can go right up to him and touch him or we can walk right away from him like Judas
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:41.600]   did. Jesus could be touched here. He could be kissed here. Indeed, even today, I think we could
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.680]   think that way about Jesus in our dying. 2 Corinthians 5, 6, we're always of good courage.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   We know that while we're at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, we walk by faith,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.040]   not by sight. Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:13.680]   with the Lord. And what he means, I think, is literally the incarnate God-man, Jesus Christ,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.480]   exists in dimensions that we don't fully understand in a human body that is different from
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   ours and yet like ours, and that when we die, we will be at home with that Christ, that God-man
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   incarnate Christ in a way that relates to his body in ways we don't fully comprehend.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.000]   But with those exceptions, namely the localized presence of God in the temple in the Old Testament
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and the localized presence of God in the incarnate Christ, with those exceptions,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.160]   the ordinary way of speaking about the presence of the nearness of God in the Bible
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.320]   is not connected with spatial orientation. And here's my answer to the question, "Well,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   then what does it refer to?" My summary answer would go like this. The presence of God or the
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:14.240]   nearness of God is a metaphor from two sides. One, our experience of it, and the other,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.400]   God's expression of it. Our experience of it means that we taste or feel or realize
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.600]   the reality of God more directly, more authentically, more intimately, more effectively,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   that is, producing more effects in our lives more certainly, more satisfyingly, or more terrifyingly,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:48.480]   and so on. In other words, his presence as we experience him is the heightening of his reality
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.960]   in our lives, either for good if we're in his grace or for ill if we're under his wrath, which
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.200]   is why Jesus makes all the difference here to shield us and make God a welcoming reality or
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   presence for us. So, for example, we read, Psalm 100, "Serve the Lord with gladness, come into his
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   presence with singing," or James 4, 8, "Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you." These are
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.480]   invitations into the fuller, more intense, more certain, more joyful, more satisfying,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:39.840]   more transforming experience of the reality of God. That's my first half of the metaphor. The
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:48.880]   other half is that it refers to God's manifest influence from his side, not thinking now about
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.000]   our experience of it, but his more manifest influence. And I'm thinking of a text like Psalm
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.280]   114, verse 7, "Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.000]   who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water." In other words,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:22.800]   when God manifests himself or his presence in a fresh, new way, stunning things just objectively
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:32.480]   happen in the world, whether or not anybody experiences them or not. So, in summary, God is,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:41.840]   yes, to be sure, omnipresent in some of his influences, like his sustaining all things
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   at all times, holding every electron and every sub-nuclear particle in its place. But he makes
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:02.080]   his influence more manifestly felt and experienced in particular ways, in particular times, and this
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:10.000]   is what we are referring to when we say with a psalmist, "For me, it is good to be near God. I
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   have made the Lord my refuge, that I may tell of his works," or that's Psalm 73, 28. Here's 145,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.280]   18. The Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth. That doesn't
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   mean that God traveled some distance. It means he's near in the sense that he exerts his influence
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:42.080]   for our good in special ways and causes us to experience the sweetness of his reality
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   in special ways. Yeah, amen. Thank you, Pastor John. Well, you can keep up with the daily Ask
