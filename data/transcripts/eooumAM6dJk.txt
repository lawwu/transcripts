[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820]   After reading the book, I was inclined to think that intelligence matters more than
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.820]   I previously thought.
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.820]   Not less.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.820]   >>Good.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.820]   You might have undervalued it.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.880]   >>Or not even that.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.360]   You say in the book that intelligence has convex returns and it matters especially for
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360]   areas like inventors.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   >>Right.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.560]   >>Then you also say that if you look at some of the most important things in society, something
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920]   like what Larry and Sergey did, they're basically inventors, right?
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.760]   So many of the most important things in society, intelligence matters more.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.580]   And not only that, it has increasing returns.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.840]   And it seems like with emergent ventures or a venture like that, you're trying to pick
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.920]   the people who are at the tail, right?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   You're not looking for a barista at Starbucks.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.760]   >>Sure.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   Awesome.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.400]   >>So it seems like you should care about intelligence more given the evidence there.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   >>More than who does?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.000]   I mean, there's a lot of jobs that I actually hire for in actual life where smarts are not
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.760]   the main thing I look for.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   Most jobs.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.920]   I think the convexity of returns to intelligence is embedded in a multiplicative model where
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   the IQ returns only cash out for people good at all these other things.
