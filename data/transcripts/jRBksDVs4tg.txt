[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   Narcissism is not arrogance.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.220]   Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.260]   There is such a deep sense of inadequacy
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.780]   and incompetence in the self
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.060]   that the defensive structure around that
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.420]   becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.580]   The following is a conversation with Paul Conti,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.100]   a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human nature.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.500]   My friend, Andrew Huberman, told me that Paul and I
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620]   absolutely must meet and talk,
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.540]   not just about the topic of trauma,
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.300]   which Paul wrote an amazing book about,
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.060]   but broadly about human nature,
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.920]   about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.320]   good and evil, hate and love, happiness and envy.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   As usual, Andrew was right.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.460]   This was a fascinating conversation.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.860]   As the old meme goes,
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.900]   one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.780]   Allow me to also quickly mention
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.220]   that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode,
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.220]   as I do in other episodes, even with experts,
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940]   in part for fun and in part because I think
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.060]   the tension of ideas in conversation
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.400]   is what creates insights and wisdom.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400]   My goal is to always empathize, understand,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.780]   and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.640]   Disagreement is just one of the ways
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.740]   I think it's fun to do just that,
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.740]   as long as I do so from a place of curiosity and compassion.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.220]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.340]   in the description.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820]   And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conte.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.900]   Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.180]   a study of the human mind and not just a set of tools
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.860]   for treating psychological maladies?
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.680]   Absolutely.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.860]   I think psychiatry is our best way
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.260]   to understand who we are as people.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.140]   I mean, it looks at our biology.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.260]   How does our brain work?
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.680]   How does it connect the parts with one another?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.400]   How does the chemistry in it work?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.280]   It's the very foundational aspects of who we are,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.460]   and then it manifests as psychology.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.300]   What do we think?
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.120]   What do we feel?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.960]   What are our strivings?
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.200]   What are our fears?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.340]   So, yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.700]   that we can use to help each other,
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.020]   but those tools come through it
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.300]   being a discipline of understanding.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.020]   So with every patient you see,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.900]   with every mind you explore,
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660]   are you picking up a deeper understanding
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.560]   of the human mind?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.740]   I think I'm trying to.
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.200]   I think we should learn,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080]   should be able to take something away
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.000]   from everything we do,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.340]   every interaction to some small degree.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.560]   Every conversation,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.780]   it doesn't have to be a patient,
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.720]   just anywhere, at Starbucks, getting a coffee,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800]   you can learn something from that little experience.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.420]   Yeah, even if you just reinforce
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.960]   sort of gentle kindness and gratitude
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.680]   and decent human interaction,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.900]   there's a reinforcement of that,
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.620]   that even if we don't take away memories
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.140]   or lessons, so to speak,
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.340]   we can reinforce who we choose to be.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.620]   So understanding ourselves from those interactions,
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.180]   not just the general sort of philosophical human mind,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.340]   but understanding our own mind,
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.660]   introspect on how our own mind works.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.900]   - Yeah, 'cause everything we understand
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.940]   about anyone or anything else
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.300]   is coming through here, right?
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.580]   So, yeah, we're understanding others,
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.140]   we're also understanding ourselves.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.180]   It's all feeding through us.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.060]   - Yeah, but it's a tricky thing
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.980]   to step away and look at your own mind
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.680]   and understand that it's just a machine.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.480]   You can kind of control the way the machine processes
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.020]   the external environment
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.040]   and the way that machine converts
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   the things it perceives into actual emotions,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   like how it interprets the things it perceives.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.180]   You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.480]   and then you can control it.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.620]   You can oil the machine,
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.400]   you can control how it actually interprets the perceptions
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.680]   in order to generate positive emotions
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.040]   and be like a, what is it,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.680]   like a mechanic for the gears in the machine.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.600]   - I mean, I think to some degree, to some degree,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.680]   but the difference, I think,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.700]   at least as I understand,
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.140]   I think of machines as not being inscrutable, right?
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.800]   That if there's enough study,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.980]   there's enough acumen applied
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.480]   that we can understand whatever it is
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.800]   we're trying to figure out,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.480]   whereas part of understanding ourselves
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.640]   is understanding that there are things we can't understand.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   And I think that's indispensably important
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.480]   to health and happiness
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.540]   and also to having enough humility
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.240]   to see how people can be different from us,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   how we can be different from ourselves at times.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   So knowing that we don't know a lot
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.120]   and having some idea of what that might be,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   I think is an indispensable part of the process,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.040]   which I think is different from machines, I think.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.000]   - Yeah, the machines, you're basically saying
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.200]   machines generally, because they're engineered
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.640]   from a design, they're usually going to be simpler,
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.360]   therefore understandable.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.020]   And you're saying the complexity of the human mind is,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.960]   at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240]   - Is there a meta-phenomenon,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.720]   what sometimes gets described
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.060]   as sort of levels of emergence,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.280]   where at increasing levels of complexity,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   you have novelty evolve that you can't predict
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.820]   from lower levels of complexity.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.720]   Like, for example, atoms to molecules,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.360]   it's just one example.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.800]   I think neurons to consciousness,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.120]   consciousness to culture,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.440]   that there are meta-phenomenon that separate
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.680]   from the phenomenon underneath of them,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.840]   and thereby add an entire aspect of novelty.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.400]   that we are all infinitely fascinating
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.240]   because of these levels of emergence, of novelty,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.180]   that are inscrutable because you can't predict
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.620]   from one level to the next, or understand fully,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.940]   are what make us, and not just us,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.860]   but I think sentient creatures, right?
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.300]   Human beings, right?
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.160]   But sentient creatures, inestimably more interesting
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.940]   than creatures that aren't sentient.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.660]   And I don't know, I think when we think
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.720]   about machine learning and artificial intelligence,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.260]   I think it's that that we're trying to create,
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.720]   levels of emergence that now
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.060]   we don't fully understand anymore,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.660]   which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.060]   - Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.320]   quantum mechanics, go into chemistry, go into biology.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.460]   From the biology, you have the functional phenomena,
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.180]   especially as manifested in the human brain,
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.780]   and then multiple brains connecting together
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.180]   through consciousness and intelligence
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.140]   creates civilizations.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.020]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.660]   Where do you think the magic is?
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.380]   At which layer of the cake?
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.380]   - Every layer.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.660]   Because every time you emerge from one thing to another,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.020]   I see it as an analog, the concept of the dialectic,
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.900]   where I think it was Hegel who realized,
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.940]   hey, when you have thing A and thing B,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.300]   and they're complicated and they come together,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.180]   you don't get a hybrid of A and B.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.380]   You end up getting something that's new, that's novel.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.500]   And I think that describes to some degree
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.640]   what emergence is, except there's,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.240]   there's a whole new, it's a universe of novelty
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.920]   that comes at each layer of emergence
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.660]   that allows infinite possibilities
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.560]   that weren't possible before.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.120]   And I think that's why we're so complicated,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.000]   that we're, our functional neuroscience,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.200]   which I think is psychology,
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.960]   our ability to think about ourselves,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.800]   about others, to be reflective,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.080]   is sitting on top of so many layers of emergence.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.160]   Like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.760]   that we're, each of us, our consciousness
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.640]   is standing on the shoulder of a giant
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.480]   of many, many, many levels of emergence, of novelty,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.040]   so many of which we don't understand.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.480]   I mean, that's subatomic particles,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.880]   everything that quantum physics means.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.120]   You know, when does time become important, right?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.760]   As opposed to things happening outside of time
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.160]   and outside of space,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.140]   when do we slot into one temporal perspective,
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.640]   and then the complexity just, I think,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.760]   grows and grows and grows.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.160]   - Yeah, the interesting word you use is novelty.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.560]   If true, this really blows my mind.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.600]   In some either shallow or deep sense, it is true.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.240]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.400]   I don't know if you know something about cellular automata,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.460]   is this very simple mathematical objects
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.000]   where you have rules that govern
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.120]   each individual little cell,
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.800]   and they interact locally,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.360]   and that, you know, you understand
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.320]   the very simple operation of those individual cells,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.920]   but add another layer of abstraction
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.720]   when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.040]   these meta objects starts appearing that function.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.080]   You could build a Turing machine with it.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.920]   You can build an arbitrary complexity
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.400]   of computation on top of this kind of very simple object.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.240]   - Yes.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.480]   - It's an interesting question whether that was always there.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.460]   The atoms somehow know about love, right?
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.340]   Like about consciousness,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.920]   about war and violence and evil and hate and all that.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.520]   That's already laden in the possibility of that,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.920]   the capacity for that, it's already in the atoms.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.800]   It's already in the physics, it's already in the,
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.240]   in all the different chemistry that builds up.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.460]   And it's like even the origin of life, still a mystery.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.080]   That's known, that's in the physics.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   That's known to the universe,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.040]   the basic background physics in the universe.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.560]   'Cause if that's not the case,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   it's like where does that come from?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.400]   Where's that magic?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.000]   And how many layers can the cake possibly have?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.600]   How many are we gonna keep building?
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.760]   If it's all, if there's,
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.640]   if we're constantly through this process of abstraction,
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.280]   of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.520]   like where's the ceiling?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.920]   As we expand out into the cosmos,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.400]   if we successfully can do that,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.200]   are we gonna keep building like
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.160]   more miraculous complex objects?
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.520]   And then the brain is just like a middle layer thing.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.560]   We tend to think of ourselves as truly, truly special
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.800]   manifestations of what's possible in the universe.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   But maybe we're just like the basic,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.880]   tiny building block of something much, much, much bigger.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.840]   We're in the early days of being a brick
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.600]   in a very large building.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.640]   - Sure.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.600]   I think that's entirely possible.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   I mean, I think the only emergent thing, so to speak,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   that we build is culture, the aggregation of us.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.800]   So you have individual human minds,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.000]   which are entirely unique.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.640]   I mean, even the fact that time is different
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.840]   for you and me, it may be by picoseconds.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.840]   But we can engage because our perceptions of time
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   are parallel enough, they're close enough,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   that we can share a reality.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.160]   But we're all living in a different dimension of time.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.080]   We know that.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.680]   So we're unique in that way.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.120]   And then the unique individuals that we are,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.480]   just like the cells, start to create not just one thing,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   not just a culture, but culture on top of our individuality.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.880]   Our uniqueness, our even dimensional uniqueness
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.560]   of time and experience and consciousness.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   So we create cultures on top of us.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.560]   But what could be beyond culture,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.960]   and what is different from us,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.760]   either on underlying levels, like quantum physics
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.320]   or chemistry or biology,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.200]   or entirely different and unconceived,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.440]   I think it's an immense question.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.960]   I think it's one that should create humility in us.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.760]   Look how much we don't know,
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.380]   and then how reckless we are with ourselves,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.600]   with our resources, with human life.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.800]   And I think there it's important to say,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.760]   I mean, think about how entropy rules
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.040]   the universe around us.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.800]   How over selected are we?
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.000]   How many, not just hundreds or thousands of times,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.120]   but how many millions of times does there have to be
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.640]   a selection branch point before we get into a sort of
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   eddy pool of counter entropy,
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.920]   where you can begin to create?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.520]   Which I think is why you say,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.480]   okay, do the atoms know about love?
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.900]   The fact that anything is being created, right,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.860]   means there's this over selection for counter entropy,
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.700]   where there can be a building of greater complexity,
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.900]   of ultimately of novelty.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.940]   And we don't often think about that,
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.460]   of how far removed we are,
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.380]   maybe light years, so to speak,
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.220]   from any other location,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.180]   temporally, physically in the universe,
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.240]   where this could happen.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.120]   We don't think about what does that mean?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.040]   - Everything that you said, love, everything,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.000]   is counter entropy.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.480]   Goes against the way, the basic physics of the universe.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.280]   So maybe actually the atoms really don't like
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.120]   what we're doing.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.200]   They want us to stop.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.120]   They've been trying really hard to stop.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.200]   And despite that, we somehow started this whole
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   bacteria thing for like a billion years,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.400]   and now we're here.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.600]   - I actually think of it kind of the other way.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.920]   I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.840]   So why would anything be here
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   if the drive weren't towards creativity?
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.920]   If the drive weren't towards those subatomic particles,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.000]   not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.440]   like we think is going on in empty space
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   for light years upon light years.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   But is there a design, either natural or intentional,
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   for a schema, a scenario that allows for the incredibly rare
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.480]   but not non-existent eddy pool of counter entropy
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.160]   where good can happen, where creativity can happen,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.640]   where ultimately something can grow,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.560]   something novel can happen.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.740]   There's no novelty in the vastness of space,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.280]   even though there's not nothing there.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.000]   There's novelty here because I think the layers
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.400]   of emergence start stacking very, very, very high
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.540]   when we're in a place of counter entropy,
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.440]   which then could provide even thoughts
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.680]   about good and evil, the idea that creating,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.700]   that preserving is good.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.680]   It's what we build upon.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.460]   It's how we get to the eddy pool of counter entropy.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.320]   So then destruction is not good.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.840]   What good comes of aggression and destruction?
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.280]   Unless we're protecting,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.600]   or even you can think of outline cases,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   but just think in general concepts.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   Destruction destroys.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.800]   It brings us towards a state of entropy,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.200]   towards a state of nothingness,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   whereas goodness, commonality, collaboration, nurturing,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.000]   brings novelty, it brings new existence into the universe.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.400]   And I think we don't think about that.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   We're in the middle of something so vast
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.160]   and built on top of so many layers,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.240]   and I think it leads us to be cavalier
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.000]   with human life, including often our own.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.680]   - So you think there's an underlying creative force
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.560]   to the universe that might even have
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.120]   a kind of built-in morality to it,
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.840]   where creating is better than destroying,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.360]   and then that somehow maps on to our society,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.400]   where we kind of try to figure out
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.760]   what that actually means in terms of good and evil.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   So something is there like that.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   But it has to be, it's so nice, it's so perfect,
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.240]   'cause it's rare, it's sufficiently rare
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.320]   where we have our own space,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.120]   like you can close the door and it's like,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.560]   I need to be alone right now,
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   as our human civilization, to work on my thing.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   So it's sufficiently rare
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.200]   that there's not other alien civilizations
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.960]   that are just constantly knocking on our door,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.280]   destroying us, but it still exists.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.400]   That's weird.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.360]   - Right, right.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.080]   It's so fantastically improbable
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.120]   that I think we should be very respectful of it.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.280]   And I think you said there's a creative force
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.320]   that values creativity.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.200]   Things would be, well sure, it's a creative force.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.840]   Its existence, its ability to exist and to create
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.280]   comes from something other than entropy,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.040]   something other than so much dispersion
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.360]   that there's nothingness.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   So the creative force will value the sanctity of things,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.680]   keeping things together, not destroying things, right?
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.840]   Building novelty, including novelty of knowledge,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.880]   novelty of sentience.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.980]   I mean, it fits with the idea that we're not nothing,
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.240]   that that's incredibly improbable,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.140]   and that there are these many, many layers of emergence
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.960]   that we're standing upon.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   And I think it tells us something
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.160]   that we're not doing ourselves a service to ignore, right?
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.200]   It's not just a jump to saying,
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.880]   oh, there's a religious answer to everything.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.760]   It's just, no, it's saying science isn't a god either, right?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.000]   So if we think of science as a tool
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.940]   and not as an endpoint in and of itself,
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.960]   what is the science telling us?
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.160]   I remember showing up at medical school,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.120]   and it really is true.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.400]   I mean, I knew so little about the human body.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.360]   I'd only been in hospitals to visit people.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   I'd taken pre-med classes,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.400]   but sort of intensely at once
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.680]   after I didn't take any and I was working in business.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.160]   I knew next to nothing.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.920]   And I had this idea that was so naive in retrospect
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.840]   that I was gonna learn so much, right?
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   I was gonna answer these questions
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.460]   'cause I was gonna learn what's going on in the body.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.440]   What are these organs doing?
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.640]   What are these cells?
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   And what I learned was there was so much more
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   that was amazing and mysterious and seemingly impossible,
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.000]   like even how a cell functions, right?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.840]   Like what is going on inside of a cell,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.760]   the transport mechanisms and energy functions
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.080]   and diffusion functions.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.320]   And then you can go down to smaller levels than that.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   But when you come back out and you say,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.980]   how will those cells make a kidney?
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.960]   It's not explanatory.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.560]   I remember asking the OB who had delivered my first child.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.280]   I was so amazed, and I asked him,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.400]   what do you think?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   What do you know?
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.160]   You do this, right?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.320]   You're seeing this life created.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.120]   And his thought was, nothing.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.400]   I just marvel.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.160]   I mean, I get to do this, but I just marvel at it.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.000]   And I think the more we know about us,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.040]   the more we respectfully marvel.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   - And we should do that.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.160]   We should proactively marvel at every aspect,
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   at every layer that where the novelty emerges.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.520]   - Yes, we'd be a lot less likely to say,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.420]   hey, I don't like you because of something,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.200]   whatever it is, race, religion, culture,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.760]   sexuality, gender identity, whatever it is.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.200]   Or I wanna say, I want rights that you don't have, right?
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.280]   Or I want what you have, right?
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.760]   I mean, there's so much of this.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.820]   And I understand it's driven by scarcity
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.480]   and by human insecurity and envy
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.840]   and all of these things that I think
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.760]   drive us towards destruction.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.920]   But all of that recklessness comes from
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.360]   not having this initial appreciation and respect
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.520]   that you're referring to and just marveling at.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.420]   Like, wow, okay, we're here.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.260]   That's amazing.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.960]   Let's start with that.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.300]   - But if we marvel at this whole thing,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.280]   the human project, the human condition,
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.440]   all the different kinds of human beings that are possible,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.280]   what do you then make of that
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.540]   some humans do evil onto the world?
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.480]   First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.960]   If we're in the process,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.560]   now we've got a little bit of momentum
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.920]   in terms of marveling the layers of the cake.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.000]   Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil in all of us?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.320]   - Yes. - Is that capacity there?
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.360]   - I believe that it is, yes.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.680]   - So what do we understand about the psychology of evil?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.260]   Where does that originate in the human mind?
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260]   Is it there in the neurobiology?
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.840]   Is it there in the environment, in the upbringing?
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.720]   - Can I clarify first?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.060]   I think the capacity for evil, I do believe, is in all of us.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.120]   There's a difference between enacting evil
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   and a sort of preset, followed, developed plan of evil.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.920]   I don't believe that all of us are capable of doing
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.860]   what the people who perpetrate the most evil do.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.860]   But I do believe that we're capable of perpetrating evil.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.240]   And the thought, one thought, would be
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.740]   that there are drives in us.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.400]   I mean, there certainly seem to be drives in us
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.740]   towards survival, towards gratification,
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.760]   in some ways towards pleasure.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.200]   And that can get very complicated,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.220]   'cause pleasure inside can be relief of distress.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.520]   So if I feel very badly about myself
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   and I can feel a little better about myself
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.000]   by making you feel worse about yourself,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.600]   which that plays out in a lot of human beings,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.240]   is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure?
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.960]   So it gets very complicated what's going on inside of us.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   And sometimes the perpetration of evil things
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.160]   I mean, there are things that we can have in us.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.920]   And other times there can be other things going on
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.320]   which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.760]   So for example, the psychology of envy,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.960]   which I think drives the lion's share
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.800]   of the orchestrated evil, right?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   There's a difference between impulsive, reflexive evil
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.640]   and highly orchestrated evil,
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.440]   which I think is driven by envy.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.520]   - Highly orchestrated evil,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.200]   are we talking about a scale of societies
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.680]   like totalitarianism?
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.960]   So if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler?
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   So at scale, orchestration of evil, envy driving that.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.360]   So I mean, that's really interesting to think about.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.440]   I'd love to hear more about it.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.800]   So some of it, there might be some psychological forces
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.580]   that are in tension with each other.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.380]   So one is, if you look at somebody like Hitler,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.960]   it's difficult to know what was going on in his mind,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.160]   but it's possible to imagine
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.240]   if you just look at dictators throughout history,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.800]   that he thought he was doing good,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.920]   not just for himself,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.600]   but for the people he believed have value.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.200]   So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.960]   is by devaluing some group of people.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   And that could be all group of people.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.480]   So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of idea
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.640]   that you basically don't care about other human beings.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.480]   That's one.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.520]   Envy is different.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.400]   I mean, maybe they can collaborate together,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.120]   or even like you mentioned,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.920]   you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.100]   That's almost like different,
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.800]   because if all it is is like narcissism,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.320]   you disregard, you don't care how others feel,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.800]   then you can just make cold, calculated,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.200]   military, almost economic decisions.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.640]   And you don't care if a million people die here or there.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.500]   But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that,
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.920]   or there is like a resentment that fuels it,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.200]   it's not just cold calculation.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.640]   It's like fueled by some kind of personal
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.040]   or cultural resentment.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.680]   - I think it's all fueled by that.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.520]   - You think so?
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.340]   - I think it's all fueled by that.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.320]   I think the idea that say Hitler thought he was doing good,
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.320]   right, is like, that is such a thin facade
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.120]   that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane, right?
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.400]   - Okay, yeah, thank you.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   That's wow, that's beautiful, yeah.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:47.000]   - It's built upon, it says, I'll explain, logical lies,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.680]   right, because people can build lies
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.080]   upon specious logic, right?
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.580]   So the idea that, okay, I am doing good
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.580]   because I believe that this ethnicity of people is good
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.120]   and this is bad, and now I'm going to do this
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.400]   and I'm gonna make the world different
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.280]   and it's gonna bring better to the world,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.840]   and now I'm raising armies
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.320]   and I'm building concentration camps.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.080]   And I think this is all in the service of good,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.000]   is I don't think anyone ever thinks that, right?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.880]   Or they think that, but with,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.960]   because they're living in the surface patina, right?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.920]   Like they're not allowing the hurricane in
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.340]   that blows away the handkerchief
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.600]   and says, this is all evil, right?
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.200]   I mean, how do you decide that some group of people is good
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.720]   and some is bad, and what is it that you take upon yourself
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.560]   to play God or make decisions about the world?
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.120]   And I think what really is going on
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.040]   is that people are not doing that, right?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.360]   There's something cobbled together to say,
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.480]   like, why this is right and this is okay, right?
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.000]   And this is even good, right?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.600]   But it is all a lie, right?
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.880]   It's a lie that's adorning,
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.260]   that what I believe is the fact, I believe,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.000]   that what's going on is the gratification of envy
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.040]   inside of the person.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.880]   And whether someone says, oh, I think this is good
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.440]   and it's okay if a million people die,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.280]   or I'm gonna enjoy that a million people die,
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.440]   I think is the same.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.200]   I think the enjoyment, the gratification
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.000]   of the orchestrated evil is there,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.080]   and that it all comes from vulnerability and insecurity.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.580]   It all comes from deficits in the sense of self.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.680]   - I'm gonna have to process that.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.720]   My slow penny and PC is processing that,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   so envy underlies all of it.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.120]   The psychological concept of envy, what is that?
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.840]   I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.560]   That has nothing to do,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   it doesn't have to do with Jews or Slavic people.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.080]   Does it have to do with specific amorphous other
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.600]   in his mind that he's envious of?
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.840]   - I think it has all to do with him, all to do with him.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.720]   There's not a love of the people with whom he allied,
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.400]   or even a sense of the people who he persecuted
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.600]   were worse than him.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.280]   It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.160]   which was an intense sense of inadequacy,
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser than.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.240]   That's the difference.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.760]   We can define words in different ways,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.600]   even within psychology, but let's say we take
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   the definition here of jealousy as being benign.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.320]   The idea that, oh, I might see something
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.360]   that you have that I don't, and I might think,
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.880]   I like that, maybe I'll work harder to get it.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.080]   Or maybe I can't get it,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.760]   maybe it's that you're younger than I am.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.720]   I say, okay, you have that and I don't.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.240]   I mean, I have other things too, I'm okay anyway.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.040]   But I might want those things.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.640]   But it's very benign, the jealousy.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.240]   I'd like to be younger, I'd like to be richer,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.040]   whatever it is that we people think.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.240]   But it's just a thought, and it's a thought
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   that can result in strivings or acceptance.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.600]   It's very, very different.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.960]   It's completely different than envy, which is destructive.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.040]   It's a thought of, I see something that you have
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.520]   that I don't have, and instead of me working for it
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.320]   or accepting that I don't have it,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.380]   what I'd like to do then is bring you down,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.280]   take you down to where I am, and then I'll feel better,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.280]   because from the perspective of envy, it is all relative.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.920]   - So is jealousy a kind of, 'cause you said
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.200]   completely different, but is jealousy potentially
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.000]   like a gateway drug to envy?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.920]   Is it a slippery slope?
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.800]   - I think, no, I think that jealousy is a natural,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.160]   just part of the human phenomenon that we go through life,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.640]   and we see, oh, I'd like to have that.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.480]   I think it's part of our incentives.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.680]   I'm farming, and I have one row of crops,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.440]   and I look over, and I see that you're working harder,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.600]   and you have two, and I'd like to have two.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.360]   That can make me work harder to have two.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.600]   - You don't think it's a slippery slope
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.000]   from one to the other, to at first you're like,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.840]   I'd like to work harder, but then you keep failing,
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.480]   and the weather sucks, and you keep failing,
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.400]   and the other person becomes more successful.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.640]   Plus, he's got a new hot wife now.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.980]   There's a nice tractor.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.960]   Does it feel it's all working?
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.800]   And then you get this idea that, you know what?
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.920]   I'm gonna steal all his stuff, and I'm gonna murder him,
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.880]   and that, don't you think that's just like a leap
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   of the same phenomenon? - No, I actually think,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.920]   no, no, because I think there are things
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.680]   that are in us as humans, right?
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.480]   So the things that just by being human,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.120]   like we can, for example, feel,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.580]   we can feel compassion, right?
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.280]   We can feel interest, right?
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.920]   We can feel jealousy in that benign sense.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's all part of just being human.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.800]   If we start going from, hey, you have more crops
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.960]   than I have, and now it seems like I actually
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.740]   have a better life in a lot of ways than I have,
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.440]   I'm gonna kill you, that is not a progression
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.080]   of something benign, right?
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.680]   That is-- - But wait a minute,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.560]   but that is a human leap of the same thing, isn't it?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.200]   'Cause you're drawing a line, stuff,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.360]   you're saying like, this human stuff,
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.480]   this regular life is benign, but it feels
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.000]   like this benign thing is just a low magnitude thing,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.640]   version of the thing that's not benign.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.520]   Like there's probably a gray area
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.800]   where it stops being benign.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.480]   Like jealousy, you can have like healthy jealousy,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.640]   you can have a little bit slightly unhealthy.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   There's a, I think, Jealous Guy,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   this John Lennon song that I love, it's just beautiful.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.440]   I mean, there's like, this jealousy inside relationships
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.240]   can make you feel like, you know,
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.520]   take your minds in all kinds of silly directions.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.440]   And it's crazy, but like it feels like that's
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.840]   a next door neighbor to like being really crazy and toxic
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.640]   and all that kind of stuff inside relationships.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.400]   And then that feels like a next door neighbor,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.440]   it's like an apartment building,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.800]   that feels like a next door neighbor
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.280]   that eventually gets to Hitler
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.200]   with envy and resentment of an entire population of people.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.260]   - You're right in that there's a causal,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.000]   there can be a causal chain, right?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.840]   Like if I'm not feeling jealous,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.140]   maybe I won't ever feel envious, right?
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.720]   So you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead,
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   it can open gates to, huh, like how much do I dislike
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.360]   that you have things that I don't have, right?
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.400]   So yes, in that sense, but, and I think,
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.080]   this is the part that I think is so important,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.320]   that I think there is a disjunction, right?
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.560]   There's an asymptotic shift, right,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   from one thing to another because it is very--
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.600]   - Now you're speaking my language, mathematically.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.040]   - Yeah. - Asymptotic leap, yep.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.580]   - Yes, that's, it's a way to convey, right,
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.240]   something that's entirely different
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.500]   because if I start thinking, you know,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.660]   I'm not gonna try and make things better, right,
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.900]   I'd like instead to harm you, that's qualitatively different.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.740]   - Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is?
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.820]   It could be, I don't know what you think about this,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   but it's in which direction your motivation is pointing.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.660]   So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.940]   your sort of, the motivation says,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.500]   okay, I understand this feeling,
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.400]   I wanna do less of it.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.640]   I think there must be a threshold
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.140]   to which you actually wanna do more of it,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.440]   like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.040]   So that's what envy becomes.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.240]   Like the first feeling, this idea
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.640]   that I'm gonna kill the farmer,
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.600]   turns into like more and more and more
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.760]   and you can't sleep and you're visualizing the farmer
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.280]   and he becomes the devil and like you have this very,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.600]   you know, it's basically a thing that builds
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   into the negative direction
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.560]   versus returns to the stable center.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.380]   - Now a person is cultivating evil.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.220]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.980]   They're saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil in all of us.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.000]   Let me take that seed out, dust it off,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.240]   plant it, nurture it, right?
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.900]   And then grow that seed of evil,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.820]   which will affect all other parts of the person's life.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.300]   Right, they won't behave the same
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.460]   towards others in their life.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.220]   They'll become different as they nurture fantasies of evil,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.700]   as they begin to create inside of themselves
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.040]   the motivation and the will to enact evil.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.600]   The Hitler analogy would say,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.920]   look, you take someone who had a bad childhood, right?
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.680]   Who was not loved, who was taught
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.400]   and told that he was less than.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.560]   Okay, like that, we know that happens.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.440]   I mean, that's why child abuse is so evil, right?
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.600]   It's telling children the worst possible wrong lessons.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.560]   Right, they're not good enough.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.680]   They'll always be hurt.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.120]   You know, they can't keep themselves safe.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.880]   They don't deserve safety, right?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.380]   So then you take someone who then nurtures
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.060]   that seed of evil, which is a choice.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.580]   And it's why I can't paint well enough,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.460]   and no one appreciates me, and I don't like how I look,
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.940]   and I don't fit in with the people I wanna fit in with,
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.100]   and then, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   And there's a hatred of self through that lens of misery,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.540]   of just being repulsed by the self.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.420]   But that's unacceptable to the self.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.020]   So, oh, it has to be someone else's fault, right?
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.860]   It's not my fault.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.340]   Whose fault is it, right?
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.520]   And then you see en masse the inaction of evil
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.120]   towards groups of people who somehow,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.680]   in this person's mind, right,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.240]   are responsible for his misery.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.360]   And there's the justification of evil,
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.040]   and then all the, you know, whether it's,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.360]   this will be better for the economy,
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.480]   this will be good, this will be that.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.080]   Like, that's all lies built to justify the evil.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.640]   - Those are surface-level narratives.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.900]   - Yes.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.600]   - And the envy is the deep-down mechanism that enables--
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.340]   - And that's the end point that's being served.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.760]   What's being served is destruction, right?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.040]   Which is why it always brings more destruction, right?
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.360]   I mean, how many times do wars that were started
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.980]   for purposes that we would look and say,
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.460]   like, those were evil purposes.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.400]   Like, how many times does good come of that?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.960]   Even if we look at the modern world,
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   what comes of it is more evil, is more destruction.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.080]   You know, Hitler's outward destruction
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.200]   eventually came inward, and you know,
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.400]   you see pictures of what Berlin looked like
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.800]   after the Second World War, right?
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.600]   It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.760]   as awful as that is, it's catchy, right?
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.360]   Like, people used to worry if you, you know,
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.400]   before the, during the time of the Manhattan Project,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.240]   right, if you start this chain reaction,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.480]   you know, will you blow the whole world up, right?
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.880]   Or will it stop within this bomb or not?
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.040]   And we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.120]   hasn't yet blown the whole world up,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.040]   but look at the, look at how the catastrophe spreads.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.200]   You think 50 to 60 million people dead
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.920]   in the Second World War, which truly was a world war.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.480]   What destruction was spread around the globe?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.160]   - And this is something that can't be stopped
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   once the chain reaction starts.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.640]   Like, if Hitler was successful,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.840]   like, it would just keep going.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.600]   - If he had been, think about it, if he just--
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.360]   - On his personal, psychological level, I mean.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.720]   - Right, 'cause if we think from the perspective
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.400]   of destruction, success would have needed,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.960]   led to the need to conquer more,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.600]   then there's factions and infighting,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.280]   and then eventually you get the same mass destruction, right?
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.600]   And never does the inaction of evil
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.960]   satisfy what the person is initially seeking.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.040]   Like, people wanna feel better about themselves, right?
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.680]   We, you know, like, Winnicott,
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.960]   who was a British pediatrician
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.560]   who wrote about children and adults
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.000]   from very deep perspectives,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.200]   he wrote about the idea of good enough, right?
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.160]   And then you can sort of extrapolate that
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.000]   to like, we all wanna feel good enough.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.080]   Like, not just limp over the line good enough,
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.600]   but I wanna feel good enough
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.160]   that I'm a decent person in the world,
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.440]   and like, what I do matters,
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.960]   and, you know, I can have an impact on people,
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   and, you know, people can like me and care about me.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.160]   There's a simplicity there that people want
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.840]   that when people don't have,
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.280]   and there's certain other factors,
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.600]   maybe there are temperamental factors
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.120]   or historical factors,
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.960]   can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right?
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.640]   Through envy, and I think it starts with that,
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.560]   and it often starts in childhood, not always,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.120]   but it often starts in childhood
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.360]   when the child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable,
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.320]   and, you know, you see salient child abuse.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.240]   If you look at what was Hitler's background
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.640]   and what was Stalin's background,
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.360]   and, I mean, you could look at almost anyone
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.400]   who's perpetrated evil,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.720]   whether they're serial killers, whatever it may be,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   the majority, not everyone,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.920]   but the majority had these lessons in childhood
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.520]   that said you're not good enough,
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.800]   you can't keep yourself safe, no one cares about you,
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.000]   and in a subset of people, that's gonna generate envy,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.720]   and, you know, that seed of evil
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.320]   then gets planted and nurtured.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.840]   As a fighter jet roars above us.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.280]   - The sound of a fighter jet above us.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.200]   - It'd been good if I had orchestrated that.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.640]   - You forget, you quickly forget
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.440]   the comfort of being in a peaceful place.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.320]   That's one thing I saw in Ukraine.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.440]   Is, hey, you quickly get comfortable here.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.480]   The whole trip back, I was thinking,
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   it's so damn good to be in America.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.000]   The whole, just the whole, like,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.600]   it's like a three-day trip back.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.040]   It's so good to be American.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.480]   We might take that for granted as a population,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.440]   but I do agree.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.200]   - So the destruction never alleviates the envy.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:03.120]   Are all humans capable of envy?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.360]   - I believe the answer is yes.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.400]   If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us?
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.840]   I think the answer to that is yes,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.960]   but we have free will, we have choice,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.880]   we can choose what we do with that,
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.600]   which is why just because someone is a sociopath,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.920]   you know, for example,
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.640]   doesn't mean that they're not responsible.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.720]   I mean, our medical legal jurisprudence
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.800]   has absolutely borne that out,
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.040]   that legally, medically, we think,
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.680]   okay, we're responsible,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.760]   presuming we're healthy,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.280]   we're not unhealthy in other ways
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.680]   that eliminates our ability to be circumspect,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.280]   but that we're responsible for what we do
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.760]   and don't nurture inside of us.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.600]   I mean, there are plenty of things
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.840]   we could decide to nurture anger and hatred about.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.000]   You know, I could think of slights, difficulties,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.760]   whether it's something someone else has done to me,
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.760]   or I could blame fate,
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.640]   or I could be mad at God or the world.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.080]   We can all make those choices,
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   and we're responsible for them,
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.800]   or for recognizing things in us that are like,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.160]   oh, I too have that in me,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.200]   but I don't wanna nurture that,
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.720]   I don't wanna foster that,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.120]   or do I choose to nurture and foster that?
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.440]   And I think ultimately,
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.880]   you know, our subject of Hitler as evil,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.480]   if Hitler had kept winning and winning, right,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.040]   I think ultimately he would have been
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.000]   the only person on earth, right?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.440]   And I really do believe that ultimately,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.040]   everyone, everything else would be killed
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.400]   because it's such destruction, right?
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.120]   Destroy everything, right?
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.520]   And probably when that didn't work,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.400]   then there's the destruction of the self, right?
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Because nothing soothes envy
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:44.480]   that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.600]   And what you see is more and more anger
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.760]   and more and more frustration,
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.520]   which is why I really do believe someone like that,
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.920]   who nurtured evil in themselves that way,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.400]   ultimately would destroy.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.960]   They'd be like him and one other person,
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.320]   then he'd kill the other person.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.880]   - I think that's really powerfully said.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   But even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.120]   I still think that it's the same flame.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.000]   And envy is just the bigger version of it.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.160]   So I think, I just, in my own personal life,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   I've felt jealousy towards others, like you said,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.040]   like, oh, this person has a, I don't know,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.200]   cooler thing, trinket, whatever trinket I cared about.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.240]   And usually it's when somebody is really close
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.160]   to the trinket you're building.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:36.720]   And I, early on, like in my teens,
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.280]   I realized that just empirically speaking,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.680]   that jealousy over a period of a week
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.160]   just doesn't feel good.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.840]   And it's not productive,
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.000]   it doesn't help me build a better trinket.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.680]   Or it does if I turn it, not into jealousy
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.320]   towards another person,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.800]   but into a love for building a better trinket.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.960]   It's like, oh, cool.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.160]   Almost, you know what, like proactively speaking,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   in later in life, people like Joe Rogan
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.840]   actually have been really powerful in this for me,
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.240]   just as a fan of his, to celebrate other people.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.720]   So it's almost as opposed to ignoring that other person
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.800]   with a cool trinket,
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.120]   it's like celebrating their awesomeness, in my mind.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.440]   Just saying how awesome that humans are able to do that,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.800]   and actually just how awesome is that exact person
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.120]   at being able to do that.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.200]   And that somehow made me more capable
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.160]   to build my own trinket better.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.200]   And it feels good also, like it makes me feel happy.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.800]   - And now you're not jealous anymore.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.720]   - You're not jealous anymore.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.760]   - Right, so that's why I think jealousy is different,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.720]   right, 'cause you're saying there's a week of jealousy,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.440]   like I don't like this, right, I don't like,
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.480]   but if you take that in a way that says,
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.040]   wait a second, actually this is awesome,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.000]   this is fabulous, and this person did this,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.680]   that person's awesome, right,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.280]   then you're not raining on anyone's parade, right,
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.040]   and in not doing that, even inside your own mind,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.640]   you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.920]   Well, if he can do that or she can do that, why can't I too?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.520]   Like I wanna make the better trinket too, right?
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.400]   Now you're thinking creatively,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.220]   I just disagree with that.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.440]   I think there was a choice made,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.960]   where I looked at my, if my life was darker,
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.880]   more difficult, I think it has nothing to do
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.040]   with the actual little flame of jealousy I felt.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.800]   I think it has to do a lot more with the other context.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   If my life were more difficult, there was more abuse,
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.600]   there was more challenges, I think that decision,
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.520]   I could have made that decision a different direction.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.320]   - Yes. - Maybe, I don't know,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.760]   yeah, you've written brilliantly about trauma.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.280]   If there's a bit more trauma as the background noise
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.880]   of my decision-making, I'll be more likely
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.240]   to not be able to pull away from the gravitational field
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.800]   of that jealousy and it would build and build
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   and build and build.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   So I think, not to disagree with a brilliant person,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.240]   but I feel like that flame has the capacity
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   to engulf the whole world, I guess.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.960]   The initial flame of jealousy, the little bit,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.320]   like especially the younger you are,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.240]   it's almost like a habit that you get to build
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.480]   in either direction, 'cause I've early on built the habit
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   of saying I'm going to channel that jealousy
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.720]   into productivity and into celebrating other people
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.280]   and that jealousy disappears.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.920]   That was like a little discovery for me.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.840]   I discovered that.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.720]   That doesn't come, nobody tells that to you.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.160]   You kind of discover that little thing.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.980]   I could have easily not discovered it.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.360]   I could have easily discovered that it kind of feels good
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   to mess with that other person, to think shitty thoughts,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.440]   think negative thoughts, do negative things
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.200]   to that other person, 'cause that could also,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.120]   I just think the capacity in that initial feeling is there
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.560]   and I think it's a decision we'll make,
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   'cause otherwise, I think it dissolves responsibility.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.200]   Like, well, surely I'm not Hitler,
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.760]   therefore this jealousy is normal.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.360]   No, I just feel like every jealousy
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.840]   has the capacity to turn into, maybe not Hitler,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.560]   but a toxicity that destroys, in a small way,
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.340]   in your own little private life, but it could destroy.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.860]   - I agree that jealousy brings us,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.720]   can bring us dangerously close to envy.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.800]   I mean, maybe, let's see if,
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.480]   a heuristic we could agree on, right?
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.320]   Let's see.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.640]   So, let's say, okay, if we look at the terrain
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.100]   of the mind as geography, right?
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.160]   So, if I'm feeling happy, satisfied, proud,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.760]   like I'm pretty far from envy land, right?
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.120]   But if I'm feeling jealousy now,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.500]   I'm coming kind of closer to that border, right?
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.860]   And I still, I think there's,
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.800]   it's a big thing to go over the border, right?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.000]   That the border isn't a gray area, right?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.820]   There's a border to go over,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.280]   and I think that you're, I agree completely,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.620]   one, certainly about trauma,
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.740]   that the more trauma there is,
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.680]   because then the more misunderstandings there are
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.500]   about self and feelings that I'm not good enough,
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.340]   and then that can be anger about why,
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.560]   and who might be oppressing me,
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.360]   and, you know, I hate myself,
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.780]   and everyone else who seems to be better.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.640]   Like, so, trauma can drive us in these negative directions,
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.280]   but we're still crossing over something, right?
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.480]   So, if you have the trinket, and I think,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.880]   that's awesome, I want that, I wanna work harder.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.760]   You know what I could do, though,
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.360]   is I could sneak in tonight when no one's around,
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.880]   and I could move something.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.380]   No, no, I don't wanna do that, right?
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.280]   But it's like I came over the border a little bit,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.320]   and I thought, maybe that's a better way,
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.080]   but then I came back, right?
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.200]   And we're responsible for that, right?
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.720]   Because it is a choice to say,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.960]   I don't wanna work hard, I'm already working how hard,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.200]   I don't wanna make my trinket better,
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.040]   I wanna think mine's the best one,
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.640]   I could destroy yours, right?
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.320]   And, you know, we're letting our mind go over that border,
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.080]   and do we say, right, run that forward, right?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.860]   Let's run that forward, and put people around us
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.540]   who feel the same way, and start doing it
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.280]   so we think less of ourselves, and we debase ourselves.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   Do we run headlong in, or do we come over that boundary,
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   and that's maybe the capacity for evil in us,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.080]   that we come over that boundary, all of us, right, at times.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.800]   But do we come over it, and then say,
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.160]   no, that's not my choice, that's not my self-definition,
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.280]   and I'm coming back.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.680]   - But I'm trying to justify,
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.280]   maybe there's certain other sociological forces
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.040]   that help us cross the border, too.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.480]   So in Nazi Germany, we've been talking about Hitler,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.240]   but then there's also the German people.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.720]   And so maybe when there's a bit of a mass hysteria,
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.480]   so all these effects of, like, a combination of propaganda
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.600]   with the small jealousies and resentments
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.660]   of the people that don't cross the border,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.120]   together they can, with great charismatic leaders
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.800]   that sort of really fuel that fire that we feel
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.060]   when we're a part of the crowd.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.840]   So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.240]   we have to take that leap from jealousy to envy,
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   those can be made easier.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.440]   The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.720]   - 100%, 100%.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.560]   I think that, to me, is a massive point.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.100]   We're talking about layers of emergence, right?
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.360]   So if there's individual consciousness,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.840]   then there's culture, right?
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.360]   And we're products of the soup we swim in, so to speak.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.200]   People would say that when I was growing up, right?
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.160]   We're products of the soup we swim in.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.120]   So if the soup that we're swimming in
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.640]   is the soup of hatred, right?
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.720]   Then it's gonna foster all of those things.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.040]   So then you think about,
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.360]   just in a painting with a very broad brush,
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.920]   the culture created in Germany prior to the Second World War
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.680]   and what was the impact of the reparations
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.040]   after the First World War, right?
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.800]   Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment,
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.400]   and basically humiliation that people were feeling.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.160]   Okay, there were a whole bunch of decisions
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.880]   that impacted that cultural perspective, right?
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.580]   Then there must have been aspects,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.920]   just like I see in many ways parallels in America now,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.480]   of what are our standards
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.660]   for what we're communicating to others, right?
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.460]   How is the media deciding what's real and what's not real,
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.420]   what's true, what's not true, what's hatred,
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.280]   that is only gonna do evil versus what's hatred,
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.240]   that's okay because I might sell something
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.240]   by putting it out there?
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.600]   I mean, we know that was going on in Germany
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.880]   during the rise of the Nazis,
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.280]   and I think there's a parallel to,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.920]   do we value truth?
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.200]   Can we stand together and say,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.980]   no matter how much I might disagree with you politically,
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.420]   we can still understand that there's right and there's wrong.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.300]   There's truth and there's lies, right?
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.040]   So I think those are just two examples
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.700]   of determinants of culture,
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.020]   and then the culture is a determinant of,
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.040]   is someone like Hitler marginalized,
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.640]   that's a crazy evil person, oh my goodness, whoa, right?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.280]   Or is that someone who gains a greater following
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.160]   and more adherence,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.400]   and then there starts to be a momentum,
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.160]   because why, because what do demagogues do?
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.880]   I think they have a giant lasso
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.840]   and they harness the envy
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.480]   of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.360]   that's right, you feel worse about yourself too,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.780]   doesn't matter what the reasons are.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.660]   Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not,
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.660]   maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional,
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.220]   maybe it's personal, doesn't matter.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.100]   You have envy too, let's put it together
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.300]   and do some destruction,
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.260]   'cause that'll make us feel better, which is a lie.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.060]   - So we've talked about envy,
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.060]   where does, from the leader perspective,
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.780]   things like narcissism or sociopathy,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.820]   psychopathy come into play?
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.620]   What can you make of the world we live in,
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.320]   maybe the leaders that run the world
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.400]   from the perspective, from the lens of narcissism?
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   - So I am struck, 20 years of doing what I do now,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.020]   I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.960]   and I practice in so many different settings
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.400]   and I consult in different settings,
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.040]   I've been fortunate to have a very wide purview
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.280]   of what's going on in people and in the world around us.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.120]   And I am struck with amazement
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.920]   that of all the things I see that are, say, abnormal,
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.840]   let's say, from the mental health perspective.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.380]   This could be depression, panic attacks,
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.560]   hearing voices, addiction,
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.860]   there's so many things that cover everything
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:30.520]   that narcissism is not frequent
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   compared to a lot of other things.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   So it's small in terms of, say, a narcissistic diagnosis,
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.600]   right, it's much less than many other things.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.400]   But it causes the lion's share,
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.720]   I don't just mean the most compared to anything else,
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.640]   but I think more than 50%,
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.480]   the majority of bad things, evil things,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.560]   destructive things that I see in the world around us.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.060]   I think narcissists are wildly destructive
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.540]   because they are driven completely,
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:04.540]   they are lodged completely in the lane of envy.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.900]   - Can you try to sneak up,
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.920]   and we don't wanna be lost in definitions,
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.480]   but can you try to sneak up to a definition,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.440]   non-clinical definition of narcissism
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.160]   that we're talking about?
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:22.160]   - So narcissism is a deep, pervasive,
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.720]   and unquestioned sense of inadequacy in the self
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.540]   that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability,
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.000]   fear of destruction, fear of annihilation,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   that is compensated for by aggression,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.240]   by the mechanics of envy,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.160]   by trying to make the self seem better
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.400]   at the expense of others,
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.560]   by taking from others,
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.800]   by being completely cavalier
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   to the thoughts and feelings of others.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.120]   That narcissism is not arrogance.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.520]   Now, narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.560]   There is such a deep sense of inadequacy
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.080]   and incompetence in the self
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.360]   that the defensive structure around that
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.700]   becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:21.400]   - So the machinery of narcissism is envy,
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.160]   but what do you make of the more popularly discussed
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.760]   symptom of narcissism,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.340]   which is a seeming not caring about other people,
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:38.120]   sort of a very inward-facing focus
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.040]   in terms of the calculation you make
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.320]   when making decisions about the world?
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.200]   - Narcissistic people definitely care about other people.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.120]   It's the people who are schizoid
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.720]   and say that don't necessarily register other people.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.180]   But narcissism, people care about other people,
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:57.200]   but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.700]   If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.320]   or care much who you are.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.240]   But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care,
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.200]   because I'm watching every last detail of you.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.320]   What might you have that's better than me?
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.560]   It's an incredibly intense focus
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.340]   upon individuals and demographics of people,
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.600]   which is why it can become easy to say,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.920]   I don't care if a million people die.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.960]   How different is that from going out
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.380]   and destroying one person or a million people?
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.800]   It's in the same category of those people,
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.180]   their existence is only meaningful in how it relates to me.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.800]   - But it's still meaningful.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.240]   It just seems like a very difficult leap to take
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.620]   that I don't care that a million people die.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:52.760]   That seems to be, even with envy,
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:58.040]   that seems to be a big feeling and thought to have,
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.720]   if you at all care about them.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   Are other people, I guess, tools for alleviation
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   of your sense of inadequacy?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.240]   - Right, I don't even care about being caring at all.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.660]   I mean, care about in that noticing
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.220]   that the person exists.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.800]   Someone who wants money and notices
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.160]   that there's a $100 bill out cares about that.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.200]   They don't care about the $100 bill
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.480]   and that doesn't mean anything to them.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.160]   It's just their thoughts and feelings.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.640]   But it's gonna attract attention.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.240]   They care about it because it's something that they want.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.120]   The same way people will care about others,
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.640]   but only from the perspective of,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.280]   do you have things that I want?
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.560]   Or can I feel better about myself
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.800]   by taking something from you,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.040]   by making things worse for you?
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.600]   - People often talk about narcissism
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.300]   as the opposite of empathy.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:51.800]   But empathy, again, depends how you define it,
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   but is a careful consideration of the mental state
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.960]   of the mental space of another person,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.360]   of how the other person sees the world.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.000]   And so you're kind of saying that narcissistic people
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.400]   would also be very good at that
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.720]   in order to understand how maybe the other person
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.320]   could be manipulated or something
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.660]   to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.640]   - Right, so there's a difference
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.520]   between the mechanics of empathy.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.880]   So let's say, and we can define things different ways,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.720]   but let's say empathic attunement
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.680]   is the ability to be attuned and to think,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.200]   okay, what's going on in you?
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.360]   What might you be thinking?
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.960]   What might you be feeling?
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.400]   Some people have a lot of empathic attunement,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.960]   but we could look at that as mechanistic, right?
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.920]   It doesn't equate to care, right?
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.520]   And empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.240]   Right, so yes, people who are narcissistic,
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.480]   they can mentalize well.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:52.040]   So you mentalize, meaning the ability to understand
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.720]   or to consider thoughts, feelings, motivations,
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.400]   and other people, right?
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.960]   So people who are narcissistic
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.200]   can have empathic attunement or mentalization,
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.400]   depending upon how we wanna describe those things,
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   but that has nothing to do with care,
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.520]   with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.360]   - So in that sense, empathy, usually popularly used,
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.760]   means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.220]   There's this, I need to read this book.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.800]   I've read so little science fiction.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.760]   That's been one of my goals for this year,
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.560]   to catch up on some science fiction.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.120]   So Robert Hyland from "Stranger in a Strange Land"
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.960]   has this quote about love, which is,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.560]   "Love is that condition where another person's happiness
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.440]   "is essential to your own."
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.120]   So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy,
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.320]   where you're very sensitive,
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.040]   so mechanistically very sensitive
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.440]   to the state of another person's mind,
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.360]   and your goal is to maximize their happiness.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.520]   It's like essential to your own happiness.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:55.000]   So the happinesses are aligned,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.040]   and when that's elevated to its highest forms,
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.240]   you can call that love or magic love,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.720]   friendship and so on.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.560]   Okay.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.160]   - There's one more thing about the narcissist,
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.960]   is some people can be sort of benign narcissists,
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.080]   where they want great things for themselves,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.480]   but if they have enough great things,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.920]   they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.000]   And these are people who sometimes
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.760]   are actually quite highly liked,
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.820]   because they have to have the most money,
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.680]   the most power, the most of anything,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.920]   anything more than anyone else could challenge.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   But as long as I have that,
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.960]   it's okay that you have some too, right?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.440]   And then that can make you happy
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.080]   and can make you like me, right?
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.520]   So benign narcissists can be well-liked
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.040]   from that perspective,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.400]   but it's still all about them,
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.280]   and that can change if, for example,
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.680]   there's a scarcity of resources now, right?
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.840]   But they're generally,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.000]   they're not people who are being overtly destructive,
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.360]   although that, they're over the border
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.780]   into the envy territory, right?
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.740]   Malignant narcissists are very different,
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.100]   where they then want to have everything.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.940]   So even if I have a thousand times more than you do,
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.540]   I still envy you what you have,
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.180]   because I want to have,
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.860]   I don't think I can feel good enough about myself
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.540]   unless I have everything.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.380]   And once I have everything,
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.740]   I won't feel good enough about myself either,
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.940]   and I don't have to have more, right?
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.660]   It's like, that's malignant narcissism,
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.340]   which we think of as sociopathy, right?
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.020]   We can define these words in different ways,
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.340]   but they're very, very negative concepts.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.220]   That's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism,
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.420]   envy writ large.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.300]   - So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.400]   That's a convenient way to think about it.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.300]   - No, 'cause we can do sort of sociopathic things,
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.740]   but not be sociopathic,
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.620]   like, well, you tell a white lie.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.380]   It's like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right,
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:45.180]   is then envy writ large is malignant narcissism.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.660]   - Well, just like you're saying,
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.380]   there's empathic attunement, as you said.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.100]   So there's the mechanistic aspect of empathy and sociopathy,
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.100]   and then there's the big label you get attached
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.380]   if you're just doing that thing regularly, I guess.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.580]   - Living your life through that lens, right?
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:02.420]   - Yeah.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.740]   And is there a nice spectrum that's like
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.580]   narcissism, sociopathy, and psychopathy?
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.260]   Is it all the same kind of nice stroll through the woods
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.860]   to off the cliff, or?
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.580]   - Not really, because the words don't have clear definitions
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.300]   like psychopathy and sociopathy.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.220]   There's no real definition of psychopath or psychopathy,
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.380]   or does that mean someone's sociopathic but psychotic?
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.220]   There's really not a,
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.740]   we end up using those words colloquially,
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.540]   which is why concepts that we can define,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.460]   like envy, empathic attunement, narcissism,
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.900]   even though there might be nuances and definitions,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.580]   we can define them in ways that are widely accepted,
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.340]   including within psychology and psychiatry.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.620]   - So it's nice to just think about this broad umbrella
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.980]   of narcissism and the levels to which it's benign
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:53.180]   or malignant, and then also separating it
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.300]   to the different mechanisms, like interaction by interaction,
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.380]   which sometimes can be narcissistic, but broadly speaking,
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.740]   do you do everything through the lens
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:06.260]   of malignant narcissism that makes you a sociopath
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.220]   or a malignant narcissist?
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.820]   - Yes, and the thing I would add to that
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.340]   is the thought about culture, right?
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   It's like how does the cultures we're in,
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.500]   whether it's a culture of a household, right,
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.660]   the culture of a community,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.740]   the culture of a nation or the world,
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:23.900]   how does that impact what unfolds in that person,
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.260]   and then how does what unfolds in that person
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:27.380]   impact that culture?
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.580]   - Well, the question is what unfolds in that person,
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.220]   yeah, how does culture affect it,
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.820]   but how does your own psychological development
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   unfold that?
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.860]   Because narcissism in leaders
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.860]   is the most impactful thing, right?
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.180]   Who are the most impactful individuals?
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.380]   What is the most impact of individual psychology?
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.900]   We have, it's usually leaders of countries
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.540]   or leaders of major organizations and so on,
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.260]   and one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism,
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.500]   that seems to be aligned with success, right?
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.220]   If you care about your own success,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.300]   that's going to be, you're more likely to be,
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.340]   have narcissistic tendencies, I suppose,
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.660]   and so my question is when you follow
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.780]   that thread of narcissism to become the leader of a country,
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.020]   now you have a lot of new,
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.780]   interesting psychological complexities to deal with,
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.100]   like power, that old cliche that power corrupts,
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.860]   does that, is it possible for power to corrupt
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.220]   the human mind to where it pushes you
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   farther and farther into malignant narcissism,
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.460]   into this destructive envy?
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.140]   What are your thoughts on power,
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.300]   like the effect of power on the human mind?
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:50.740]   - Power is an accentuator, right, an intensifier, right?
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:56.420]   So I think it is true that there are people
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.540]   who can be sort of in a gray area
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.980]   where there are malignant narcissistic tendencies
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.620]   and behaviors, but there are also ways
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.660]   in which that person can think outside of themselves
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.900]   and think in a broader way
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.220]   and think sort of kindly about others,
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.860]   and they're sort of trying to navigate,
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.940]   whether they're aware or not,
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.100]   that they're trying to navigate between one and the other,
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.980]   and then the allure of power is,
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.660]   well, just look, just exercise that power
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.940]   and you'll feel better, right?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.760]   It'll show you, right, that you're good enough.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.780]   Look at the power you have,
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.420]   and whatever may be going on in the person's mind,
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:32.300]   that then power, yes, can corrupt, yes.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.740]   I think that's why we have to have checks and balances,
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.940]   right, because we don't, you know,
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.540]   we're all inscrutable to ourselves, let alone to others,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.860]   so we must have checks and balances,
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.020]   and we should always have them on ourselves
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.140]   as well as on others.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.420]   We should want that for the health of ourselves
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.460]   and the world around us.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.780]   So I think all of that is true,
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.420]   but there are also people who don't necessarily
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.420]   become corrupted by power, right?
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.060]   There can be an understanding and a grounding
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.700]   that they're a steward of power, right,
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.340]   you know, a shepherd.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.980]   I mean, there are ways people describe utilizing power
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:10.140]   and utilizing it in a benign way
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.940]   that then fosters the healthy aspects of self, right?
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.300]   So like, gratitude and humility, right?
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.420]   If we could add a healthy dose of gratitude and humility
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.740]   to everyone or to our society, there would be a sea change,
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.520]   right, but how do you feel gratitude?
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.040]   How do you feel humility?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.280]   Those things are incompatible with narcissism, envy, right,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.200]   with really the bad pole of things that we're talking about.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.560]   And part of the reason I'm so focused in my work
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.920]   and in really what runs through all of my thoughts
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.480]   about life is the impact of trauma, right,
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.260]   because trauma creates these false lessons
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.920]   and it walls us off from truth,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.800]   and it starts to point towards the unhealthy ways
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.000]   of trying to feel better about ourselves.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.120]   But we have the health in us too.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.780]   We have those seeds of health too
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.060]   that can grow into being a steward of power
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.480]   and sharing power, being considerate and kind.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.320]   And we see a lot of that in the world too, right?
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.000]   It's not all just the evil.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.520]   We see plenty of people who do good
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.920]   and who are generous of spirit.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.360]   And we have both in us, and it is,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.460]   I think you're talking about our culture
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.340]   and the seeds that we sow and the climate that we set,
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.440]   including putting governors and boundaries around.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.280]   Like, how do we rein in or say that the more aggressive,
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.280]   the more envious or destructive is unacceptable, right?
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.320]   How do we foster the part that's kind
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.340]   and considerate and reflective and slow to judge,
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.680]   of like, hey, let's learn a little bit more.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.940]   Like, how do we foster that?
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.040]   And I think a lot of that comes back
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.520]   to early childhood education.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.080]   I mean, I think we don't do nearly enough
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.120]   to protect children, and as a corollary to that,
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.400]   we don't do nearly enough to educate children.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.960]   I mean, I wanna write a book.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.520]   Second book I write is gonna be
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.240]   everything I needed to know about life
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.040]   I learned as a second year postgraduate psychiatry resident.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.360]   It's like, why?
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.280]   You know, why then did I learn so much
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.880]   about unconscious motivation, about the impact of trauma,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.940]   about how we can be envious and how we can act out,
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.880]   you know, even about how our emotions trump logic in us.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.620]   Like, why don't we teach these things
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.320]   when we're young enough to understand?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.760]   Like, why is that other kid bullying me, right?
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.400]   Or why, just because I'm a little bit bigger,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.760]   do I wanna go thump that other kid on the head?
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.080]   Like, what's going on?
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.160]   We don't do those things.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.440]   You know, we're just tripping ahead of ourselves
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.720]   and we don't stop and think, how are we using our resources?
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.080]   How are we shepherding forward the next generation,
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.160]   which, by the way, is a generation
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.880]   that's gonna determine our fates too, right,
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.560]   as we get older, but we don't, you know, do that.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.920]   I often think of, like, in the Olympics,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.520]   you know, you see, like, the great sprinters, right,
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   and they've gotta come out of the blocks perfectly, right?
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.380]   So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast,
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.440]   they're gonna fall over, right?
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.520]   They're gonna just fall forward,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.440]   and I often see that in my head about us,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.380]   as humans and as a culture,
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.200]   that we're rushing so far forward,
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.320]   we don't stop and say, wait, let's keep the basics here,
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.600]   the basic techniques of, like,
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.640]   how are we navigating forward in life?
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.900]   Or do we just throw all those away,
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.760]   because I can get some benefit by saying that you're bad,
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.600]   even though what's being leveled against you is wrong, right?
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.760]   Like, why, do I take that?
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.360]   Or do I say, no, there's something more important here
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.980]   that we wanna shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture?
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.620]   And I think preventing childhood trauma
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.260]   and changing the ways that we educate children and adults
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.980]   would, could, again, make a sea change
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.300]   and maybe set us on a course towards,
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.860]   you know, even towards a greater likelihood
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.520]   of survival as a species.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.520]   - Yeah, so talking to, like, people in elementary school
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.180]   about human nature and teaching them
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.420]   so how people can be resentful and envious
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.500]   and how to deal with your emotions,
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.300]   how to, yeah, so these basic interaction things
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.580]   about human relationships, about friendships,
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:08.500]   about betrayal, about love, about all those things.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.600]   Like, it just, it's actually strange that we don't,
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.020]   we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.860]   - Right.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.980]   - But then the parents often, you know,
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.700]   need therapy themselves.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.580]   - The parents didn't learn it, right?
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.420]   - Yeah, the parents didn't learn it.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.780]   - I mean, I'm not joking that I was mad,
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.340]   you know, second year after medical school.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.180]   Like, how is it?
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.740]   Like, I think of even things in my own life
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.900]   and, you know, how I, you know,
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.300]   how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.100]   Like, I was already an adult, right?
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:41.060]   I was a young adult, but I felt so much shame.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.760]   I didn't, like, I had no understanding that,
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.620]   that, oh, like, it's a reflex to trauma, right,
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.060]   to feel guilt and shame,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.240]   and that, of course, I was feeling that.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.280]   It didn't mean it was true because I felt it,
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.420]   but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.980]   to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed,
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.020]   and it, like, led to some very negative things in my life
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.780]   that I had to sort of pull myself back from
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.780]   and recover from, and, like, I didn't know that, right?
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.620]   I didn't know the automaticity of the reflex
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.780]   and how pervasive it can be
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.180]   and how it can put blinders on us,
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.380]   and, I mean, it's just one example,
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.780]   but, you know, it's an example of something big
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.820]   that happens to people that we don't learn about,
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.700]   and I find myself sometimes
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.260]   having conversations with a person.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.800]   So, you know, I still do a lot of clinical care
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.320]   of having conversations with a person after a tragedy,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.000]   and I'm saying, I can't believe, right,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.240]   again, I'm saying the things that this person
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.180]   didn't learn in elementary school
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.760]   because, like, none of us did, right?
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.680]   And then look at the misery and the suffering,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.960]   and then I think this is one person
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.120]   among how many millions among us
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.020]   who, you know, try and go about their way
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.600]   without knowing things that are easily knowable
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.920]   'cause they don't even know that they're knowable
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.500]   because we don't teach them to ourselves.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.640]   - So how to deal with trauma,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.560]   that trauma happens, first of all,
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.380]   that suffering can happen,
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.420]   and small trauma and big trauma,
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.660]   all of it can happen,
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.060]   and there's natural ways to deal with it.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.520]   So in the case of trauma, as you write about,
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.860]   and we can also just talk about
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.200]   some more of the details of that,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.900]   but it's good to bring it to the surface
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.260]   to talk about it, to not be ashamed to hide it inside,
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.860]   to be some kind of secret,
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:24.320]   that it's actually, I mean,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.140]   there's a lot of positive things to say here,
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.280]   at least from my perspective.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.500]   One is it's discussing trauma
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.480]   and dealing with trauma together with other human beings
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.300]   by talking about it is a path to deep friendship
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.180]   and intimacy with those people.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:41.420]   There's a dark aspect to trauma, to war,
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.420]   that communicating it or sharing it bonds you.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:50.600]   So, like, the other side of trauma is, like, love.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.000]   You need that hardship, not you don't need it,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.520]   but hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.960]   for a deep human connection,
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.120]   if you bring it to the surface,
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.160]   as opposed to kind of hide it on the inside.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.760]   If we can just linger on it,
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   because you've been through a few
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.160]   very traumatic events in your life.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.960]   When you were 25 years old, as you mentioned,
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.560]   your brother committed suicide.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:20.160]   What did that event teach you about life, about death,
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.720]   and about the human mind?
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.200]   - Well, it certainly brought me face to face
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.720]   with the truths of life and death,
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.380]   because I had not had a major trauma before then.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.760]   So there wasn't a major trauma
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.000]   sort of in my developmental years
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.100]   that what can carry forward
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.880]   is a sort of omnipotence defense, right?
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.980]   I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers,
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.040]   we all have like an omnipotence defense,
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.600]   which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.800]   And if I run into something,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.120]   I'll get up and do it again, right?
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.480]   That we kind of have to,
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.440]   and it's partly the protection of the parent, et cetera,
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.320]   but we think we can get out there in the world
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.520]   and do things, and we just do.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.140]   And if we don't have major traumas,
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.720]   we can sort of carry through the,
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.960]   oh, like bad things aren't gonna happen to me.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.880]   I know that they're there,
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.760]   and I know they happen to people,
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.900]   but they don't happen to me, right?
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.900]   And sometimes what will happen
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.680]   is being confronted with such a tragedy
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.360]   wipes that away very, very quickly,
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.200]   and then the person feels extremely exposed.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.560]   Like, oh, I thought that I was gonna be okay,
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.480]   and now I know that I'm not,
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.120]   and that can start to lead to, well, what does that mean?
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.240]   And now, is this all coming for me now?
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.200]   Did I get so lucky for 25 years, nothing bad happened,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.800]   and now nothing but bad things are gonna be happening?
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.760]   Am I cursed?
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.600]   Is my family cursed, right?
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.040]   And I think that leads to, say,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.520]   the learning about the human mind in retrospect.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.800]   I think I understood at the time to some degree,
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.760]   but not like I do now.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.040]   I can put words to it now, right?
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.920]   Of how incredibly important,
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.640]   powerfully important negative emotion is, right?
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.880]   That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.800]   can just pervade our entire life perspective.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.640]   So all of a sudden,
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.720]   we're swimming in a very different soup,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.120]   and it's a frightening soup, and it's a toxic soup,
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.080]   and I'm most struck by that.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.040]   And that goes along with the idea
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.760]   that we're not taught that emotion always beats logic.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.240]   I think the idea of Descartes,
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.720]   and the idea that we're rational creatures,
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.360]   that kinda comes down to us through Western thought,
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.520]   is completely not true.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.680]   We're rational creatures,
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.200]   only if there is an emotion grabbing for our attention.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.400]   We're attending to one another,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.600]   we're being very logical, right?
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.840]   What we're doing now,
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.360]   if we heard a frightening noise right outside the door,
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.800]   we'd be entirely different, right?
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.040]   The emotion would trump everything.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.720]   It's like, stop paying attention to this, right?
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.760]   Now safety is at stake,
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.680]   and we'd think differently, feel differently,
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.240]   behave differently, right?
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.560]   And this is what happens to us,
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.160]   not just in situations where something drags us,
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.360]   yanks us from one emotional state to another,
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.160]   but it can be very, very pervasive.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   So my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy,
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.960]   and then soothing in unhealthy ways,
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.120]   soothing by drinking too much,
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.160]   and then kinda hating myself in the first place,
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.800]   and hating the world around me,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.880]   and then starting to think, well, who cares what happens?
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.000]   Like, there's some very dark thoughts and choices
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   that came from a changed perspective of self in the world.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.240]   - So what do you do when that, because of trauma,
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.800]   again, small or large,
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.120]   you find yourself swimming or drowning
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.200]   in a soup of negative emotion?
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.040]   What do you do?
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.720]   What do you do with that emotion?
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.040]   I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma,
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.880]   as I think the interesting thing is,
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.840]   you know, any one of us throughout the day
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.160]   can find ourselves taking a bit of a dip
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.480]   in the pool of negative emotion.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.800]   What do we do with that?
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.960]   - The first thing is to separate how we feel
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.880]   from what's true,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.240]   'cause we don't do a good job of that as humans.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.360]   If I feel bad about myself, it's very easy to,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.880]   then I conclude, like, I'm bad, right?
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.080]   If I feel ashamed of myself,
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.320]   I conclude I'm a terrible person who's shameful, right?
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.440]   This is the, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.600]   of what they used to call an observing ego.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.760]   It still gets called that.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.120]   It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right?
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.840]   It's the ability to step outside and to see ourselves, right?
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.040]   So that's what lets us keep the difference
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.560]   between our feelings, right, and what we know to be true.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.960]   Like, we can be very angry at someone.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.240]   So I think that person's terrible.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.640]   I think that person's stupid.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.560]   I think that right now,
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.960]   because, like, something negative just passed between us.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.320]   This inside of me, it's just because of how I feel.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.800]   Like, when I can separate that,
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.160]   how do I actually think about that person, right?
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.040]   And, you know, we get driven so,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.920]   so frequently by how we feel,
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.800]   because how we think, therefore what we believe, right,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.300]   just kind of comes on its heels,
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.760]   as if the feeling is dragging it along.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.440]   And I've been struck by that.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.440]   It's one of the things that has struck me so,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.360]   the most, right, among the very most
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.040]   in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.280]   is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions,
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.560]   as if they are truth.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.360]   And then they create truth,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.920]   because we embrace what they're telling us as true.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.040]   And that is, I think, incredibly,
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.680]   I think it's how people learn prejudice.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.160]   I think it's how people learn self-hatred.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.200]   I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.960]   And then the blinders on us come in
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.080]   more and more and more and more.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.360]   So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel,
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.920]   unless we understand that what we feel
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.280]   is different from what we know to be true,
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.440]   or what we can decide on one way or another.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.960]   - And that requires realizing
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   and catching the emotions themselves,
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.840]   realizing that it's an emotion.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.120]   A feeling comes into your mind,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.840]   overtakes you, a feeling of anger,
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.000]   dislike, hatred, all of that, it just comes in.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.520]   It's like, why did that person just cut me off in traffic,
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   or something like that, that feeling.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.120]   So what, you just kind of take it as a feeling
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.080]   and realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.440]   some deep reality about the world that's fundamental,
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.440]   or you, that you just kind of watch it and let it pass,
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.800]   which is the natural way of things.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.080]   - Yeah, or decide if it means anything.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.240]   You know, if I'm mad, right, someone cut me off,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.200]   and I feel hatred, and I want to destroy them, right,
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.600]   to stop and think, look, I've got that in me.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.840]   Are the stressors running too high in my life?
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.680]   Like, is it really good?
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.360]   Should I be on this road 10 minutes behind schedule?
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.200]   What am I really doing?
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.880]   So we can learn, but yes, it's an observation skill,
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.160]   and it's an observation skill that we can develop.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.480]   I often think of something called the tapestry theory,
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.160]   which I think initially was a theodicy of explaining,
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.440]   I believe this is true, I'm not sure of this,
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.120]   that the idea was that, oh, we don't see God's plan
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.520]   because we're up too close to it, right?
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.120]   Like, as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall,
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.440]   and we're standing right up it,
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.560]   we're only gonna see one part of it.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.960]   We need to stand back from it.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   And I remember learning that in a religion studies class,
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.600]   being really fascinated with that at the time,
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.560]   and I think that there are a lot of things
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.600]   we do that about, right?
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.200]   And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.120]   what we're saying is, hey, just the busyness of life
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.920]   or my own impulses or the pool of emotions
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.600]   are trying to pull me up right close
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.080]   to whatever tapestry there is there,
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.240]   and I wanna sort of resist that.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:47.520]   I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it,
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.300]   and then I make a choice if I wanna come close to it.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.200]   If there's some really positive emotion,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.600]   it's friendship or it's love or it's nurturing,
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.120]   you know what, let me come right up to this, right?
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.540]   But I wanna choose when I'm doing that.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.840]   I don't want some drive.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.240]   I didn't decide to take me by the back of the head
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.280]   and put me up against that tapestry.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   - So the interesting exercise for me,
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.560]   and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.200]   is the internet with social media,
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.240]   that it's almost like going to the gym
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.080]   or something like that.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.560]   At least that's the way I see it,
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.960]   because there's a bunch of forces on social media
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.840]   that are trying to make you feel things.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.480]   Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings,
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.840]   because there is actually a strong gravity pull
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.640]   to negative feelings for some reason,
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.560]   and the brain notices them more.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.000]   I don't know what that pull is, but it's there,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.640]   and you get to observe it on social media.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.400]   Like if you actually just scroll through social media,
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.560]   you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.400]   And I just see it as a kind of exercise of like,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.320]   you feel the pull, just like when you go to the gym,
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.920]   there's a resistance, and I practice like stepping away
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.000]   to look at the tapestry, right?
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.240]   And there's different mechanisms
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.080]   I think all of us have to learn.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.440]   For me, there's a kind of,
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.680]   you mentioned gratitude and humility.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.000]   So like if somebody, if it's me personally,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.960]   I've recently gotten attacked a few places here and there,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.280]   if they're saying that they're much smarter than me,
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.040]   I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned,
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.000]   and I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.840]   Those things help me to kind of like pull away,
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.120]   and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   Like I don't take their sort of negative comments to heart,
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.560]   but I imagine the human being,
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.360]   and that they might have a lesson to teach me.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.440]   And in general, when it's more amorphous,
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.640]   kind of negative feeling,
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.120]   I think the other thing is the gratitude.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.720]   Just like different versions,
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.560]   almost meme-ifiable versions of like,
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.960]   oh, this is pretty cool.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.520]   Like we got a thing going here.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.760]   There's like human civilization,
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.120]   like bickering and having a little fun,
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.880]   like lunch food fight.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.040]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.900]   Like we get to interact in this way,
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.640]   and there's a bit of humor.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.880]   It's like Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.120]   Like Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.560]   if you're arguing about politics,
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.960]   it can feel like really intense.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.240]   Like I can't believe you said this,
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.600]   but if you zoom out, it's like family.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.480]   This is like, this is amazing.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.480]   So that kind of feeling really helps.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.800]   But it's like, it really is like going to the gym.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.880]   It's like building up a muscle
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.040]   to be able to pull away from those emotions.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.440]   I don't think I get to practice that kind of emotion
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.000]   in regular day-to-day life.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.440]   'Cause like, it's hard to get those reps.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.480]   On social media, you can really get the reps in.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.320]   It's kind of cool.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.560]   Like that's the way I see social media,
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.600]   is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.160]   of like, of gratitude, of humility,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.080]   of loving other people in the face
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   of this negative emotion, all that.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.840]   - Yes, and there's a certain kind of psychotherapy
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.120]   that talks a lot about this idea that like,
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   oh, everything is as it should be, right?
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.520]   Which doesn't mean from some moral or justice point.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.080]   It's just that often if you look at things,
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.960]   one thing leads to another, to another, to another
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.980]   in a way that's actually very, very predictable,
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.520]   even though we might be surprised about it, right?
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.000]   And so an example,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.960]   so I would say that gratitude often does come along
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.120]   with a healthy pride, right?
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.160]   So you could say in the example you gave,
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.280]   hey, I'm being assailed on social media, okay?
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.120]   So you could say, well, there was a time I sat at,
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.520]   I set forth to impact people, right?
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.240]   To be able to reach people and to impact them, right?
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.360]   And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.560]   that I've done that, right?
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.640]   'Cause look, you did it because of your effort, right?
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.360]   Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts,
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.400]   like you're responsible for it, right?
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.320]   But also you feel gratitude because any one of us
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.980]   who's here and has any opportunity
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.160]   has reason to feel immense gratitude, right?
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.640]   So then you can say, okay,
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.520]   what's actually going on here is something successful.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.540]   I set out to do something and I'm doing it, right?
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.340]   And what it brings with it
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:19.120]   absolutely includes being assailed.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.520]   There's no surprise there, right?
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.920]   That because people who have anything good
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.080]   serve as lightning rods for envy.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.800]   So then, yes, there will be people who wanna make up lies
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.920]   or whatever they wanna do
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.420]   because you become a lightning rod for envy
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.320]   about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude,
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.160]   right?
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.480]   And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.180]   I mean, you're still gonna make decisions about it,
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.040]   but it makes sense then.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.840]   Like you have a mechanism of understanding it
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.280]   that not only makes sense to you,
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.400]   but reflects the truth of what you actually have done
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.840]   and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.040]   - Well, I wonder if we're all kind of
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.200]   a little bit unique in this because for me,
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.360]   I mean, maybe it's useful to kind of talk
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.220]   through my own experience of it,
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.960]   is for me, I try to avoid,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.640]   especially in those situations, to feel pride
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.440]   because I'm just looking empirically.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.040]   I feel way happier if I focus on humility.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.760]   If I ever think of like, oh yeah,
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.200]   when you do something meaningful
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.880]   or you become more popular,
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.480]   you're going to experience these kinds of,
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:36.000]   I feel the attacks more and it's like me versus the world.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.560]   That's the feeling that you start getting
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.920]   and that does not create a pleasant feeling.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.800]   So to me, the pleasant feeling is like stepping away,
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.040]   like kind of laughing at it all, like with a smile
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.120]   and not like in a negative, like laughing at people,
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.000]   but just like laughing at the theater of it,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.320]   the circus of it, like this whole absurd existence
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.320]   we've got going on.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.640]   And then just having a humility in like,
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.120]   everybody has a lesson to teach me.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.440]   It just makes me feel good.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.660]   The pride thing, I do like feeling
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.700]   when in a positive pool of emotion.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:11.120]   So if I'm building a trinket and I finish it,
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.560]   I'm like really happy with myself.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.720]   Like I finished this thing
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.800]   and I usually actually like to do that alone.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.480]   Like I don't need an audience for pride.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.240]   I like to sit there and just like, ooh, this is cool.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.920]   I did that, you know?
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.820]   But I just, I find that in social interactions,
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:31.240]   pride is just a danger, it's a dangerous drug for me
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.080]   because it's such a small,
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.820]   it's a small step away from then losing all the humility.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.360]   And then you start getting very defensive
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.560]   and that's not going to,
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.480]   that's just, it starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.680]   But I also, I mean, with everybody,
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.520]   you've mentioned this,
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.020]   we'll probably sneak up to it in different directions.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.320]   I do think there's different brains that we all have.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.020]   Like my brain is exceptionally self-critical,
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.640]   like nonstop.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.160]   It's like an engine that's always there.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.280]   But at the same time, I'm able to zoom out
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.160]   and have gratitude.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.000]   And it's just, there's like two brains
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.320]   and they're like cohabitating happily.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.440]   And I can, the better I get at this,
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.880]   the more I can use the one that's self-critical
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.400]   when I'm trying to be productive
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.000]   'cause naturally I'm super lazy.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.320]   So I'm trying not to be less lazy, I'll be self-critical.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.680]   And then when I'm not being lazy,
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.280]   when I just, there's a special moment,
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.280]   I want to enjoy that moment,
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.600]   I'll turn on the gratitude engine.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.720]   I feel like generic advice that people would give,
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.440]   if your brain is self-critical, that's not a good thing.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.360]   Like you should probably get rid of that.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.760]   I don't know about that.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.600]   'Cause it seems to be working.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.920]   Like I kind of like it.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.560]   I kind of like this grumpy old man that's in there
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.700]   that's like, that thing you did, that really sucked.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:01.800]   I was like, and I kind of,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.120]   there's a movie, "Grumpy Old Man."
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.000]   Like I like that grumpy boy, the grumpy cat is in there.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.060]   And it's nice, but yeah, it can have bad effects
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.320]   on relationships and on maybe my wellbeing,
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.040]   maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.920]   So you have to monitor all this kind of stuff.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.400]   But I don't know, I don't know which one,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.200]   it's like, 'cause you've kind of highlighted,
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.000]   it's good to have gratitude and humility,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.640]   but it's also good to have a little bit of pride.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.780]   I wonder what that like set of ingredients
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.800]   for a healthy life looks like for each of us.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.280]   Whether we have to customize and figure out what that is.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.240]   Some of the cake is already baked is the problem.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.520]   And because of the trauma, like if I was like eight years old
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.160]   maybe I could be a little more flexible.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.960]   But at this point, like you got the thing you got
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.800]   and it's hard to like fix it.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.960]   - You can do a lot with it.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.800]   - You could.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.320]   - It may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   and a lot of pliability there.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.560]   - Across all ages.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.300]   - Again, people are different and there may be idiosyncrasies
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.120]   of why one person is in a different place.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.920]   But as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.580]   I mean, people have evolved and I've worked with people
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.560]   who've really changed themselves
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.480]   and broadened their conception and understanding.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.560]   You know, they're in their 80s.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.480]   I think we can do it at any stage of life.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.320]   And I would make a case for intrapsychic.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.900]   So not between people necessarily, right?
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.440]   But inside of oneself for the feeling of pride.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.120]   And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right?
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.280]   Let's say we call it self-esteem, right?
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.800]   Or we could call it healthy pride.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.280]   We could put either word to it.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.120]   But if you think about what we're trying to avoid,
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.680]   is say a sense of inadequacy,
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.020]   then it is good to sort of own what's ours.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.760]   We can put ourselves a little bit out of balance,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.640]   either in terms of building up resentments
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.600]   or in terms of decreasing self-confidence, right?
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.120]   If we're not owning everything that's ours, right?
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.860]   So a thought I would have about,
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.680]   let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.780]   Is it can work against vulnerability, right?
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:06.120]   Which we know can also in some situations
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.240]   push us towards jumping the boundary into envy
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.080]   and all of that.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.260]   So think about vulnerability.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.700]   If you conceive, okay, people are assailing me
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.860]   and you just go to a place of gratitude,
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.340]   it can send a message that, okay, I'm just lucky
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.820]   and I hope I continue to get lucky
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:29.020]   as opposed to like, that's not true, right?
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.620]   Like there's ability inside of me
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.060]   and discernment inside of me that tells me
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.220]   I can have a greater sense of confidence
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.820]   that I'll navigate what comes my way, right?
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.040]   So because the pride or the self-esteem part
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.000]   is owning what we've contributed
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.160]   to the goodness we've created, right?
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.720]   Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.560]   and it also helps us feel armed against say,
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.120]   the slings and arrows of whatever outrageous fortune
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.000]   may come next.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.840]   - I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.720]   Again, disagreeing with an expert here.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.920]   Yes, I think that's generally good advice
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.460]   but I think you mentioned vulnerability.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.540]   I think it's like, I've just been doing a lot of research
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.860]   on rocket engines and fuel.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.740]   Speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:20.180]   from being vulnerable because vulnerable leads to intimacy
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.060]   in friendships and relationships.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.620]   I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:29.160]   just on a friendship, on like a ideal level
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.040]   in conversations and so on.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.040]   And so I would rather err on the side of vulnerability.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.560]   Okay, to me, pride is destructive.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.480]   I think I already,
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:46.060]   yeah, I already have a pretty good engine that says like,
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:49.200]   life is awesome.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.920]   I don't need help for that.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.560]   That's fine, that one is working.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.560]   I just feel like the way to face the world
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.120]   that's full of uncertainty, that could be full of cruelty
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.880]   is with humility and gratitude.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.120]   I don't know, this pride thing,
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.740]   it feels like, I know that for a lot of people,
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.740]   it's really important to really work on pride
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.880]   to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.100]   of like, they don't give into this insecurity
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.180]   that destroys them.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:25.140]   But I just, for me, empirically speaking,
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:29.060]   I seem to be happier facing the world with humility
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.100]   and just being grateful.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.980]   The pride I'm really worried about,
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.940]   it feels more destructive than anything.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:38.020]   - See, what I think, as you're telling me that,
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.100]   I don't wanna be presumptuous,
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.100]   but I make some thoughts or some conclusions that tell me,
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.500]   hey, you're in a pretty healthy place.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.540]   The reason I say that is because
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.700]   I agree completely about vulnerability.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.020]   I mean, think about humility and gratitude
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:51.860]   make us vulnerable.
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.580]   If you're like, wow, I'm grateful, thank you,
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.940]   I'm grateful for you, we could get shot down
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.460]   or something bad could happen,
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.100]   something could make us feel bad.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.860]   So yes, we need vulnerability.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.840]   If we try and eliminate vulnerability,
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.180]   we're living miles into the envy land.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.420]   So you're describing a healthy vulnerability,
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.180]   but then my brain says that's because
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:16.280]   on the other side of the seesaw, so to speak,
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.940]   has to be a healthy sense of self,
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.280]   whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.320]   And then I'll cite what I think is the evidence for that
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.220]   is you described the negative voice
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.560]   as like the grumpy cat.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.240]   But that's a good negative voice to have,
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.660]   because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.580]   Like, come on, do better.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.420]   You can do better.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.100]   There's a negative voice in some ways,
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.420]   but it believes in you.
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.700]   Where that voice could be,
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.100]   it could be a negative voice that says,
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.300]   no, you didn't do that well because you suck.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.900]   You don't deserve anything good.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.700]   Why should you even be alive?
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:59.020]   That's the negative voice that can gain so much force
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.280]   if there isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.540]   So I think because you're well-balanced,
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.660]   you have what you need,
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.220]   and then having more of it seems like,
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.500]   oh, that's not so good.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.080]   But there are people whose negative voice
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.620]   isn't the grumpy cat.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.500]   It's hateful, right?
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.260]   And then that's a person who needs to bring that
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.140]   into greater balance.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.260]   - Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.820]   that's like a French existentialist,
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.780]   maybe a little bit of a nihilist,
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.180]   but just kinda is--
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.200]   - Sartre's cat.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.860]   - Yeah, Sartre's cat.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.700]   So it doesn't get hateful.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   It's not like a Hitler cat.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.460]   So it's a little more,
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:40.660]   yeah, I guess there is kinda like this line
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.720]   that we've come across a couple of times
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.120]   between the benign and the malignant.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.900]   But of course, you have to monitor that line.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.540]   I think you have to be careful
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:53.700]   when you face really difficult situations
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.900]   of as you go on through life,
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.900]   more and more difficult,
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.900]   so you face a lot of loss and suffering,
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.180]   especially later in life.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:05.100]   You have to be careful with that voice.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.540]   That grumpy cat can get awfully confident.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.180]   And then if you don't have any source
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.820]   of positive emotions in your life,
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.380]   you can become too heavy of a burden.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:16.780]   - Yes, which I think this leads us to,
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.540]   well, I think it's a really important fact, right?
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.860]   That there are some people,
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.100]   like a significant subset of people,
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.900]   who get happier as they get older.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.500]   They have more contentment, a stronger sense of self.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.820]   We might think, how could that ever happen?
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.500]   We're getting closer to death,
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.540]   we're accumulating insults, right?
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.380]   Everything hurts a little bit more,
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.500]   and we have less energy,
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.500]   and we accumulate losses and traumas.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.900]   Why would anyone be healthier across time,
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.620]   be happier across time?
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.220]   And what we see is it's linked
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.260]   to the things that we're talking about.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.300]   It's linked to, let's say, vulnerability versus pride.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.460]   There's a good balance there.
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.660]   There's a lot of humility.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.340]   There's a lot of self-esteem.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:56.780]   The person is spending a lot of time
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.860]   standing back from the tapestry and looking at it.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.740]   And what can come into people
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.460]   is in sort of a sense of equanimity.
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.660]   Like, I sort of understand,
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:08.740]   I'm being the best person I can be.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.460]   And that's not always even great,
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.180]   and there are things that I don't feel great about,
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.540]   even while I'm trying to do that.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.780]   But look, I'm being who I'm choosing to be, right?
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.620]   And that doesn't have to be in some big way.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.380]   I'm not saying that means any one specific thing.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.620]   That can mean the person who's taking care of their cat
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:25.900]   and tending their garden.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.780]   That's enough.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.900]   We have to have love,
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.380]   the ability to put good things out in the world,
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.820]   and to put our ability to work
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.260]   and to make things different out into the world
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.500]   and make things better.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.220]   And if we're doing that,
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.460]   we get happier across time
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.420]   because we come to a sense of peace with ourselves.
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.660]   I'm not supposed to be everything.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.820]   I'm not supposed to do everything.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.860]   I'm not supposed to fix everything.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.540]   I'm also not supposed to suffer all the time
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.420]   for the things I haven't gotten right.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.460]   You know what?
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.300]   I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott,
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.380]   the British physician,
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.900]   of I'm good enough.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:05.300]   And that seems to help people feel happy,
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.460]   contentment and be generative and productive
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.380]   into later life.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.940]   It's like that's what we all should be wanting.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.660]   But it's even, it's kind of an afterthought, though.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.460]   Some people are like that as opposed to,
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.020]   wait a second, right?
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.780]   What's going on with them?
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.060]   And let's do all of that.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.620]   Albert Camus writes in "Myth of Sisyphus,"
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.100]   quote, "There's only one real serious philosophical problem
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.180]   and that is suicide.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.860]   Deciding whether or not life is worth living
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.580]   is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:38.340]   All other questions follow from that."
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.240]   So basically, to be or not to be.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.060]   Do you think there's a truth to that statement?
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.840]   This question of why live at all?
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.880]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.840]   Do you think there's truth to that statement
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.400]   being a really, really important question for us to answer?
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.080]   - Yes, yes.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.720]   - And what's the answer?
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.680]   - I think the answer is yes.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.680]   And I think Camus answered it yes, too.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.120]   You know, I love his writing,
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:11.120]   and I think there was a streak of nihilism
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.360]   that I think grew in his writing over the years,
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.280]   and the thought is, I think, that Camus died by suicide.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.360]   I think we're not sure of that
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.520]   because it was a car accident.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.400]   But I've always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.000]   And I think it's interesting that after his death,
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.760]   a book called "The First Man" was published,
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.760]   which I don't know if he had intended to publish.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.280]   I don't remember the specifics about it,
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.560]   but it's about him as a child, right?
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.280]   And it's interesting, the first man.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.440]   He was the first man in his existence, right?
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.480]   The most, you know, the one that felt
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.960]   and experienced everything.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.680]   And there's sadness and distress and all in that book,
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.240]   but there's a beauty of life and living and experience.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.040]   And I think to compare that beauty,
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.720]   like that's life,
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.800]   even if something's difficult and scary and sad.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.400]   Like there's something beautiful around the corner,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.760]   and here's a kind person and a new discovery.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.160]   You know, more what was in him as a child.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.480]   And I think that we can get jaded,
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.440]   as you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.080]   We can accentuate the negative and foster the negative
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.880]   and come to a place where we're looking for
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.440]   some in-depth philosophical answer, you know,
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.120]   some thick book, you know,
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.040]   that's gonna explain all that to us
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.560]   instead of the simplicity that we've been talking about.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.800]   I think humility, gratitude,
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.360]   helps us have just simple positive experiences,
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.400]   feelings of contentment,
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.240]   feelings of connection with another person,
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.640]   learning, discovery.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.200]   And I think the answer to Caymu's question is yes,
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.380]   and I think it lies in his writing
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.280]   about when he was a child,
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.880]   which I think he saw as less important
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.760]   than his later writings and the intellectual heaviness
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:52.280]   when I think maybe he had lost his way a little bit
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.800]   from the things he understood when he was younger.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.840]   - So another way to talk about it,
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.860]   and I'd love to hear what you think,
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:02.360]   is about these broad categories,
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.280]   let me be started with Kierkegaard,
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.920]   of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.140]   And I think Caymu considered himself an absurdist,
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.740]   not actually an existentialist.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.780]   It's kind of a middle ground where I think existentialists,
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.020]   I don't want to characterize it in the wrong way,
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:22.460]   and there's a lot of different definitions,
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.740]   but I think existentialists ultimately
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:29.180]   do think that there is meaning
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.260]   in sort of pursuing the passion of life,
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:35.900]   like pursuing the, like in living life.
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.180]   That's where you discover the meaning
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:41.640]   at that individual level of fully embracing life.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.780]   And I think sort of nihilism is,
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.060]   again, it's kind of like a spectrum,
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:52.060]   but nihilism basically says there's no meaning,
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:56.520]   and it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.500]   I don't even know, but somehow that lands you
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.860]   in a place that's totally uninspired.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.500]   Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:08.260]   Maybe there's a way to live a creative life
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.220]   in a nihilistic mindset.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:14.540]   And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:19.540]   where pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.860]   So kind of I think existentialists say
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.540]   you should be looking for meaning,
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.060]   and it's to be discovered in your own actions,
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:30.140]   in your own life, in the moment.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:34.440]   And absurdism says life is absurd, nothing makes sense,
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.620]   don't look for the meaning, just live, just be.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:42.620]   I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of philosophy.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.320]   I don't know if you can sort of comment
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.340]   on these kind of nuanced ideas here.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:52.340]   If there is no religious guide to your life,
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:56.820]   what do you think about this kind of search for meaning?
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.460]   Do you see that there's some wisdom
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:01.620]   in the existentialist perspective of discovering it
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.680]   in your own life, in this passion,
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.220]   in this kind of day-to-day existence,
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.120]   in the moments of your life that bring you joy,
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:08.960]   that kind of thing?
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.720]   - You're bringing different sort of perspectives
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.200]   and trying to tease apart, like, well, wait,
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.480]   what are the differences in those perspectives?
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:17.040]   And I think what it points out is that,
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.720]   okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings,
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.120]   and to take two different things
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.680]   and try and make them into one.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.800]   But we also, I think, on the other end of the spectrum,
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.960]   get very overly reductionist.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.340]   And I think that when we get too overly reductionist,
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.360]   we lose the ability to learn from anything
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.200]   or to generate meaning.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.000]   I mean, think about Sartre,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.120]   who the thought of existentialism
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.640]   is so consistent with him,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:43.120]   who, on the one hand, wrote about very clear terms,
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.600]   like this is what it is and this is what it isn't,
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.960]   and here's how you're gonna make your meaning
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.800]   in a very academically proscribed way.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.320]   But he also wrote short stories like "The Wall,"
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.920]   where something totally absurd happens
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.360]   as part of the story.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.720]   So I think what ends up happening
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.240]   is people either reduce themselves
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.160]   or get associated with something,
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.140]   that by being overly reductionist
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:05.900]   takes us away from meaning.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.640]   The idea that, look, we don't know
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.200]   if there is an overarching religious meaning
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.800]   or what we call a religious meaning or purpose.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.960]   We don't know that.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.720]   So, okay, if we take that as a given,
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.440]   that people who say that they know are having faith,
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.080]   like how Spinoza described faith.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.120]   Faith is that you don't know, but you believe anyway.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.100]   It's not because you have faith
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.760]   now you know something, right?
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.840]   Because I think that's a slippery slope
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.200]   to the persecution of others, right?
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.520]   So if we say, okay, we don't know,
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.360]   then we're left either deciding,
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.160]   okay, well, then to hell with everything.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:46.280]   There's that movie "A Strange Brew," right?
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.880]   Bob and Doug McKenzie, where the brakes don't work
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.280]   on the car and one of them says,
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.080]   "Oh, why bother steering?"
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.600]   So if we don't know that there's meaning,
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.440]   like why bother steering?
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.920]   Let's just give up the ghost, right?
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.160]   And I don't think that's even what the nihilists said.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.760]   I mean, I think Bakunin said,
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.740]   we should get rid of everything that we've ever created
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.520]   except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.140]   and start over from there.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.300]   But so even people who are very nihilistic
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.040]   or associated with that,
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:12.500]   a lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right?
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.700]   So if we accept that a lot of what we have built
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.720]   as humans inside of us and outside of us
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.980]   is really counterproductive and doesn't help us,
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:23.080]   and that absurd things happen in the world, right?
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.780]   And that often the way social structures
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:27.980]   and systems build up, build themselves up is absurd.
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.560]   I think our healthcare system
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.060]   operates in a way that's absurd, right?
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:34.500]   So if we accept that there are absurdities
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.580]   that we don't know if there's truth,
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.760]   then what are we left with?
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.740]   But like, well, let's try and make meaning, right?
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.660]   Ortega y Gasset said,
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.740]   "Yo soy yo en mi circunstancia," right?
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.820]   I am myself in my circumstances, right?
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.160]   Which is like, look, we can't control everything.
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.940]   We live in circumstances around us,
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:54.020]   but within those circumstances,
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:57.980]   we can make decisions and define ourselves.
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:59.660]   And I think the brilliance of that,
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:01.800]   and I think tying it all together, right,
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.020]   in a way that's not trying to be,
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.240]   in a sense it ties it all together
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.160]   by not trying to answer everything concisely,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.860]   that yes, we can make meaning.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:10.700]   Like, we see that.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.500]   If someone trips in front of me,
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.320]   I could walk around them or I could help them up.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.700]   I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter what I do.
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.860]   I absolutely reject the idea that,
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:22.180]   oh, I could step over them or on them,
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.060]   or I could help them up and it doesn't matter.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.300]   Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground, right?
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.540]   So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances,
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.140]   and there are absurdities both within us
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:36.420]   and outside of us in our social structures.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.660]   And there are a lot of things
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:40.020]   that pretend to have meaning that don't,
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.060]   and there's the shades of nihilism,
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.300]   but ultimately there's something going on here
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.580]   that's doing the best we can
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.340]   in the context of just not knowing.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.500]   - Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic,
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.820]   I think, I tend to think just observing the internet,
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.320]   the number of memes there are,
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.860]   I think many other people are like me.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:01.900]   I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.900]   I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:06.300]   I see the Kafkaesque nature of society,
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:07.860]   different aspects of society,
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:11.300]   and just kind of notice the magic with a smile.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.780]   And just laugh at the circus of it all.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.860]   'Cause it is magical that the circus all comes together.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:20.100]   It's like a little bit out of sync,
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.380]   and then there's a guy playing trombone,
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:24.260]   but overall it's pretty good.
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.100]   It's pretty good.
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.060]   - Right, and we can look at that and just kind of marvel,
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:30.500]   go, huh, which I think is a relation
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.420]   to at least a lot of what we, in the Western world,
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.340]   think of as Eastern, as non-attachment.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.580]   Because then if there's something absurd,
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.580]   and it's not good for me, then I accept that too,
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.780]   instead of getting angry about it, and railing about it,
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:47.080]   or seeing some cosmic meaning in it.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.060]   I think there's also a healthy non-attachment
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.580]   in what you're saying too.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.340]   - So there's, you mentioned Eastern thought,
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.180]   there's Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, but also Buddha,
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:00.420]   have kind of spoke of life as suffering.
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.960]   Do you think there's truth to that,
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.060]   that suffering is a fundamental part of life?
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:08.620]   - I think it is a fundamental part of life.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.820]   I don't think that means that life is suffering.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:14.780]   If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing?
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.900]   That I'm trying to erase from my mind
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.420]   the birth of my children, right?
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.940]   Things that were filled with joy, right?
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:23.500]   Life is not entirely suffering,
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.060]   but life brings a lot of suffering.
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.140]   And for some people, it brings such disproportionate
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:31.500]   suffering, and the people don't survive the suffering.
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.260]   And I think when people are conscientious and empathic,
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.740]   that really bothers us, right?
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.060]   The suffering in our own lives,
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.920]   and the fact that others at times could seem to be
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.420]   so overwhelmed by suffering,
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.060]   that they don't even get a chance to see good.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:48.020]   And I think that there's, I do think there's truth to that,
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:50.260]   and there's sadness and distress to that.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.860]   But to say, therefore, life is suffering,
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.780]   I think is completely untrue.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:58.340]   And it ignores the fact that someone even made a trombone,
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.180]   right, let alone that there's a little bit out of sync,
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.740]   and someone's playing the trombone.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.340]   That's cool, there's elements of the absurd
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.980]   that are neat and interesting.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.620]   And if we start accepting that we can't understand
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.300]   or control everything, then we can accept,
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:17.900]   and I think really love and foster the beauty in our lives.
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:21.500]   - Yeah, I think the word suffering
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:24.060]   is doing a little bit too much work,
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.260]   'cause I think it's probably referring
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.920]   to the philosophical concept of that,
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.820]   yeah, that it's absurd, the absurdity.
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:32.660]   - Right. - That stuff
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.840]   just happens randomly.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.580]   Evil people succeed, good people fail.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:38.940]   - Right. - There's a seeming
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:41.540]   random injustice on occasion.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.060]   - Right. - And on occasion,
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.660]   there's justice in, yeah, all of it
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:51.140]   that feels like, and maybe because it,
[01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:52.980]   often there's a lot of loss,
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:57.980]   and then there's a kind of matching complementary aspect
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:02.600]   to any good feeling that all comes crashing down,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:06.780]   like every hello from a physics perspective
[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.000]   ends in a goodbye.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.180]   Like, that's a really sad thing,
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:19.700]   like I've, all the amazing people I get to meet in my life,
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:23.500]   all the amazing experiences, eventually they have to end,
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:26.180]   and that's part of what makes them amazing.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.780]   - Why is that sad?
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.380]   Is it because we're taught to think that it's,
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.340]   look, at some point, you and I are gonna say goodbye today,
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.820]   like I hope we're richer for it,
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.700]   and then we take that goodness off with us.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:38.140]   Like, I wanna celebrate that
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.860]   because it's all part of the goodness.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.660]   I think we're taught to think, oh, that's so bad,
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   and it equates to death and misery,
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:47.420]   and I think it's often not that way.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.660]   - I think there is a sadness to it,
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:53.380]   but I also don't think that sadness is a negative thing.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:56.280]   It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing,
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.260]   so there's a melancholic nature to it,
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:01.140]   something passing of it leaving.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.580]   I mean, it's that old Louis C.K. thing
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:07.020]   that I go back to over and over from his show "Louis,"
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:12.020]   where he was all heartbroken that he just broke up
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.420]   with somebody he loved,
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:18.940]   and he told about that to an old man,
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.620]   and the old man said, "You're a fool.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.820]   "That's the best part.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:24.220]   "I missed that part,"
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:27.180]   where you sort of are lingering in that loss.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.940]   You're feeling the pain of that loss
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.920]   because that lasts the longest.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.220]   It's the most intense.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.740]   It's the most reliable,
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:37.020]   and it's a kind of celebration of the love you had.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.720]   Like, losing the love is still a celebration of the love.
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.900]   I think you don't wanna over-romanticize that,
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.220]   but there's some aspect of truth to that.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:51.860]   Like, that melancholic feeling of remembering
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:53.980]   a beautiful time that's no longer there
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:57.340]   is a kind of celebration of it
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:59.340]   and is a kind of joyful experience,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:04.340]   even though it's very easy to experience it
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.260]   as a negative emotion.
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.540]   I think it's just like you said.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.420]   I mean, it's up to our mind to determine
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.300]   how that emotion is really felt,
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.420]   but it's a tricky one 'cause it's like heartbreak
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.380]   to experience that as a positive thing.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.900]   - People can reminisce at funerals, right, and laugh
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.780]   because people can be very, very, very sad
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:23.220]   and perceive that this person has died
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.000]   and perceive the sadness of it,
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.980]   but in perceiving that and really living in it,
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.820]   then you can have people who wanna remember that person
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.620]   by telling a funny story.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:33.460]   Why?
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:35.300]   Because each of those people carries that with them.
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.020]   So I think what you're saying is consistent
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.260]   with healthy function as human beings
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.540]   because we're gonna encounter sadness and loss.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.360]   What do we do with that, right,
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.220]   and do we do things that ultimately create some redemption
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.520]   or even reparation inside of us?
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.380]   And reparation's a big word in psychology, right?
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.140]   It's how we repair damage and loss.
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:56.260]   So if we lose someone and we're sad,
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:59.580]   can we, by telling funny stories about that person,
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.720]   remind ourselves that, hey, they're still inside of us.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.320]   Whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know,
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.700]   but I can call that person of mine inside of us
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:08.240]   and then we have something that's good and beautiful
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:09.420]   that comes of that too.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:15.220]   - In the introduction to your book on trauma,
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:16.660]   Lady Gaga wrote it.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:18.360]   She wrote the foreword, the intro.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.420]   She said this about you, quote,
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:26.180]   "I can now say with certainty that this man saved my life.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:29.140]   "He made life worth living."
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:31.100]   This goes to our discussion about
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:36.380]   the myth of Sisyphus, Camus question about why live.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.600]   So I think, at least to me,
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.160]   she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:47.400]   So it's a difficult question, but a question of creativity.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.400]   What role does trauma play in somebody like that,
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.860]   in this artist that has created some incredible things?
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:02.860]   What positive, constructive role does trauma serve
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.160]   and what limiting role does it serve
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.980]   in preventing that person from flourishing more?
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:15.260]   - Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity,
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:19.000]   even to push against or to protest against
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.040]   what the trauma tells us.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.220]   Trauma tells us lessons, like nothing matters
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.680]   and you don't matter and nothing will ever be good
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.160]   and nothing is beautiful and we can push against trauma.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.720]   There is life in me, there's something,
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.880]   there's goodness for me to spread in the world,
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.480]   to express and spread.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.680]   So I think trauma fuels creativity in many, many, many ways.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.320]   Trauma also shuts down creativity.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.320]   People who are, one example,
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.360]   trauma that escalates to the point
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.880]   where now the person is soothing it with alcohol,
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:52.440]   one example, and now the impact of the alcohol
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.960]   shuts down any creativity.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.520]   So can people be creative
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.600]   and outward thinking without trauma?
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.560]   I think sometimes, if I remember correctly,
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.640]   people will use Immanuel Kant as an example,
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.280]   someone who I think hadn't traveled much
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.960]   and didn't have trauma and look at what he knew.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.880]   So okay, there are gonna be exceptions,
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.760]   but a lot of our creativity is in some ways
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.780]   fueled by our suffering, although it's complicated
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.040]   because it comes from generative places in us.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:20.000]   So those places are there, they're not created by suffering,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.760]   but maybe suffering makes an incentive
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.880]   or a passion inside of us.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:28.360]   And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to,
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.120]   is just such an incredible, astounding creative force.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.120]   And sure, some of that comes from trauma,
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.440]   some of it comes from trauma
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.560]   fueling the generative creative places in her.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.960]   But what I helped her to do,
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.560]   she's very generous with her words,
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.360]   but what I helped her to do was to see
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:51.120]   all that she is and all that the creativity in her is
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:53.920]   and all that there is to create
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:58.840]   through love and caring and compassion
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.640]   and to again, see that.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.240]   I mean, a lot of time, that's what I'm doing clinically.
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.640]   I think it's what good psychiatrists
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:06.120]   or mental health professionals do
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.600]   is we help people see the beauty that is there, right?
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:13.040]   Because oftentimes we're way too close up to that tapestry
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.680]   and what brings us close is often the sad thing.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.300]   So we're up close and all we see is the negative.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:21.120]   I mean, it's easy then to get classically nihilistic,
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.680]   but by helping someone take a step back
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.640]   and to see who they are and what's in them,
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.280]   that's how people get better
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.320]   and it's how people re-engage in life.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.320]   - It's such a difficult thing
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.720]   because if you were to,
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:38.120]   from studying human beings,
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.560]   it seems like the optimal trajectory
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.020]   is having some trauma that doesn't destroy you,
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:50.600]   that forces you early in life to really struggle
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:54.040]   with the intricacies of the human condition
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.600]   and then later in life, as you form
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:00.000]   and you build an expertise around and mastery,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.320]   start to do exactly what you said,
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.680]   which is step back and look at the tapestry.
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:08.640]   So if you don't have the trauma,
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.680]   it seems like just empirically speaking,
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.600]   there's of course just a huge amount of data
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.360]   and all kinds of anecdotal evidence,
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.880]   but I wanna be careful here
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:22.600]   'cause maybe I'm romanticizing hardship,
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.880]   but it does seem that hardship in childhood,
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.480]   if it doesn't break you, can be constructive.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.440]   It's like you said, having that trauma,
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.920]   one of the ways to fight it is to say,
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.400]   I am worth something.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.720]   David Goggins talks about this.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.520]   I am somebody, I can be somebody special
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.640]   and I'm gonna prove it to you, I'm gonna do this,
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:49.920]   I'm gonna do this big thing.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.240]   It's this engine that drives you forward.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:56.440]   Yeah, comment on that because from a parent's perspective,
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:01.440]   you want a child to have an easy life, right?
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:05.280]   You want them to not have hardship,
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.740]   certainly not have trauma,
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.360]   but that's such a difficult dance
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.400]   because in some ways, a little bit of hardship
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:17.280]   and a gradually increasing amount of hardship
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.760]   that doesn't break you can really develop you
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.800]   into a really interesting, complicated person
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.280]   and it helps you flourish as a creative being.
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:29.000]   I don't know if there's a question.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.040]   I just keep saying random things.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:34.600]   - No, I think it makes good sense to me.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.120]   I think you're trying to get at,
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.800]   do we need trauma and how are we defining it?
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.840]   Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.800]   I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart,
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.000]   say and differentiate things that are difficult
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.400]   but that are overcomable versus things
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.960]   that we could use the word trauma this way,
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.960]   if we chose to, that are just entirely negative.
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.200]   Like someone saying, oh, you can't do that
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.080]   and you'll never succeed because,
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.680]   and then they tell you something about yourself,
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:07.600]   because you're from here or you're this race, religion,
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:08.640]   whatever it is, right?
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:11.440]   We think, well, that could make someone say,
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.760]   hey, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna overcome, right?
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.880]   But then they're overcoming something bad, right?
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.280]   Like it's just like there's nothing good
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.520]   or helpful about that, right?
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.360]   If someone's saying that,
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.160]   so the person has to overcome it.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.800]   That's different than something that is placed
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.600]   in front of a person where the whole conception
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.480]   of it is something positive
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.240]   that you can make through effort, right?
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.760]   So, I remember, I don't know, I think I was 15 years old.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:40.160]   There was some rule like where you could then go,
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.160]   I don't think it was picking raspberries or blueberries,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.960]   right, and I think, and my parents wanted me to see,
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.680]   like, hey, go see how that works,
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.800]   and now you got 50 cents at the end of it, right?
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:50.120]   And then you think about that when you wanna buy
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:53.600]   baseball cards or you think about it and you work hard.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.440]   And I can remember like it was hard
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.920]   and I was sweating and I was tired,
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.160]   but I learned from it.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.760]   I mean, it's the reason I remember it today.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.240]   So, yes, parents might want their kids
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:04.480]   to have like a good life, right?
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.560]   But not necessarily an easy life, you know?
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.920]   And I think that was done,
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.760]   they took me to do that so I'd have
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.120]   a greater sense of responsibility
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.000]   and a sense of like hard work is meaningful
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:14.840]   and it's important.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.280]   And I think that that kind of thing is good,
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.320]   but if we separate that from something
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.480]   that's just denigrating, prejudicial,
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.320]   like I think those things aren't good,
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.680]   but they're unavoidable.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.320]   So, it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.600]   I would look at it more that some trauma's unavoidable.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.440]   I mean, you know, it's hard to,
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.960]   how do you go through life and not have any losses
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:38.000]   or anything negative or anything sad?
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.040]   And then people are people.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.040]   There may be people who have not a lot of that
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.800]   and then there's a sort of complacency
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.800]   and they don't do as much as they could
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.160]   or feel as good as they could.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.320]   You know, then there's other people
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:49.040]   who have a highly attuned emotional,
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.000]   so there's people with very highly attuned
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.560]   emotional compasses for which a little bit
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.960]   of trauma becomes so intrusive.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.320]   So, it's so much of it is person-driven,
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.160]   but I do wanna distinguish between things
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   that are just purely bad that we might overcome
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.800]   or find some fire in our belly about
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.280]   or whatever the case may be,
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.760]   and things that may be boundaries or barriers
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.960]   either purposely placed or not that, in a sense,
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.080]   invite us or inform us of the possibility
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.520]   of striving and overcoming.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.600]   - Finally, in tuned emotional compasses,
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.920]   it's so true that there is, that's a component of it too.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:29.400]   It's almost genetic, how sensitive you are
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.360]   to particular trauma.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.640]   So, little things can have a huge impact
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:37.280]   or gigantic things, serious abuse in childhood
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:40.920]   can be, by some people, overcome more easily.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.760]   It's so interesting. - It's not just
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:42.600]   what's the trauma.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.760]   What's the trauma that makes certain problems?
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.720]   You have to match the trauma to the person,
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:48.400]   and a big part of what you're matching to
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.440]   is that genetically-based characteristic
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.800]   of how finely attuned is that empathic attunement
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.680]   to that compass.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.760]   - So, when you think about, let's just return to childhood.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.800]   When you think about trauma in childhood,
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:06.800]   what can we say about the impact of child abuse
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:13.240]   on the development of a human being?
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:18.240]   I think the impact of it is so disproportionately bad,
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:26.400]   hurtful, compared to things that happen
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.560]   when we're not children.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.960]   And I wanna be very careful about how I'm saying that
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:34.120]   because people can, through their strength and resilience
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:38.200]   and human interconnectedness, can overcome that.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.200]   I don't mean to say that anyone who's experienced
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.960]   those things can't make it through it or over it.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.120]   That part is not true.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.800]   But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.480]   to anything else that can happen
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:56.240]   because the brain is formulating.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.280]   So, both, if we say psychology
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.720]   is like applied neurobiology, right?
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:05.720]   And we look at both of those as different ends, right?
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.800]   Even though there's a lot of gray in the middle,
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:10.440]   you know, the neurobiology is changed.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:15.120]   So, just one example of a much greater salience
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.120]   of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection,
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:24.720]   mechanisms that can make a person feel more fear
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.640]   and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:28.920]   and not trust the world.
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.920]   And I mean not trust the world even enough that,
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:33.560]   oh, I'd like to have a better job
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:36.520]   and another one is here that I could take,
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:38.240]   but maybe it could be worse.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.280]   And then being afraid of that, right?
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:43.080]   There are all sorts of ways in which
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:46.080]   the changes to those pathways impact someone.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.680]   And that's just one of,
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.720]   you know, we could bring trauma experts together
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.360]   that could talk about that for days, right?
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:54.000]   Like, what is the impact upon the brain biology?
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.640]   So, that then gets changed inside the person.
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:00.040]   And from the perspective of those changes,
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.880]   the psychology on top of it changes.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:03.280]   Like, what do I think about myself?
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.960]   Do I think that I'm worthwhile?
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.280]   You know, even in my mid-20s after,
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.800]   without formative traumas and a pretty strong sense of self
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.840]   and some achievements, there's a big trauma then
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.480]   with the death of my brother and I start questioning,
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.520]   am I cursed, am I worth anything?
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.920]   I mean, I was 20-something years old
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:23.760]   and doing reasonably well at the time.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.600]   You know, how does this impact a child
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.800]   of six, seven, 10, 12 years old, right?
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.340]   We're sending such powerful messages
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:37.440]   that then change conception of self
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.840]   and that negatively changed conception
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.400]   sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.360]   And I think if we really thought,
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.840]   hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general,
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.760]   for the human race, for species in general,
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:52.520]   is we would handle children and caring for children
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.360]   so much differently in terms of protection mechanisms,
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.560]   intervention mechanisms.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.080]   How many times do you see where,
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.360]   where like now there's been some tragedy
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.480]   and the child gets a little bit of support
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.880]   and they had some therapy that was provided
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.200]   by some insurance carrier, you know,
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.680]   that they got once a week for 16 weeks or whatever.
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:16.560]   I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.360]   around children, but we don't use our resources well.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.160]   You know, I was just reading, it's a little bit of an aside,
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:26.000]   but about 300 and something billion dollars a year
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.400]   in cost to the US economy just from schizophrenia.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.720]   And you think, it costs a fraction,
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.080]   what do we actually put into caring for people
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:37.360]   who have schizophrenia?
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.760]   So first there's a moral imperative,
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.160]   but let's say we put that aside
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:43.880]   and we only care about the economy, right?
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.040]   Because there are mechanisms of thinking
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:46.880]   that look at it that way.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.560]   How could we not amend that, right?
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:52.560]   But we are so reckless with our resources
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.360]   and we're tripping ahead of ourselves
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.280]   that we don't think, oh my goodness,
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.160]   there is no better place on God's earth
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.160]   for prevention than here,
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.920]   prevention in terms of human suffering
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:05.240]   and also where do people like that go?
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.440]   I mean, more often people like that go
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.960]   to a place of increased suffering,
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.640]   inability to take care of themselves
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.360]   or to be in supportive relationships.
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.640]   Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that,
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:18.120]   but we're also creating the pool of people
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:21.640]   through which the envy, the narcissism,
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.840]   the sociopathy, the destruction arises.
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.960]   So again, if we care about people,
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:29.400]   we would be so focused on that.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.200]   If we don't care about other people
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.200]   and just ourselves or just economic costs,
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.840]   we would still be so focused.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.520]   But we're not and we tend to just kind of call it good
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.000]   because we don't see anything disastrous
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.240]   happening at the moment.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.720]   And I think there's a societal negligence there
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:47.320]   to the shame really of all of us
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:52.440]   when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.240]   and psychologically is potentially
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.160]   the greatest cause of suffering directly
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:59.200]   and indirectly on the face of the planet.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.800]   - How much does trauma of that kind
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.800]   and later in life affect your ability
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.920]   to love another human being,
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.800]   say inside a relationship,
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.360]   connect with another human being?
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.840]   - It can impact it a lot.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.120]   And again, I wanna say, can people overcome
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.800]   and be as loving to a partner or a child or anyone else?
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.720]   Yes, but we're talking across society, right?
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.680]   How are we setting the odds, right?
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:29.080]   We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance,
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.600]   a decreased sense of self-confidence,
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.800]   an increased sense of vulnerability, right?
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:36.600]   A decreased comfort interacting with others, right?
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.240]   What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.800]   and misery and depression and resentment.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.400]   I mean, those factors push towards that.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.480]   We know that the research is so strong
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.120]   that adverse childhood experiences,
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.760]   that these things that happen,
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:53.540]   the more the worse, the more prolonged,
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.020]   the more that person is up against
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.520]   as they try and navigate life.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:03.260]   - And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.440]   like what we're talking about is vulnerability.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:11.440]   And maybe there's a, is there a fear of being vulnerable,
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.240]   of being hurt again?
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.080]   - Sure.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.320]   - Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy?
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.240]   - Yeah, if you're taught a lesson that says,
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:21.440]   the world is not safe,
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:24.240]   and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe,
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:27.280]   and you're not strong enough to keep yourself safe,
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:28.880]   that's a final common pathway
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:32.120]   of the vast majority of child abuse, right?
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.120]   Is telling those lessons to people,
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.720]   then how can that not change the lay of the land
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.840]   against openness, against the ability
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.420]   to rationally consider trust and mutuality
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:47.600]   and to protect oneself, but also take chances
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.920]   and do the things that we have to do
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:52.820]   to create the greatest happiness in our lives.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:56.160]   We set the odds so much against that.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.200]   - There's another pathway,
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.360]   which I think is really interesting
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.800]   because I've seen it in people,
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:05.600]   is this kind of ability to detach yourself
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:11.480]   from feeling any emotions, to protect yourself.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.240]   It's almost like you're not quite there.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.360]   - There's a word for this, isolation of affect.
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:17.840]   It's a defense mechanism.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:18.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.500]   - Isolation of affect.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:20.320]   - Yeah.
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:21.320]   - Is that a common way,
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:24.960]   another common way to deal with trauma?
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:28.440]   - Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.960]   So if there's been a major trauma,
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.000]   let's say someone has seen something terrible
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.840]   and they're isolated from their affect.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.120]   And at one time it was thought,
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.320]   well, maybe that's good, right?
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.520]   They're not hysterical, they're not distraught,
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.420]   but we see that is not good, right?
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.920]   Because what needs to be held, processed,
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.040]   we need to get our arms around in some way, shape, or form
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:51.480]   has just been separated off, right?
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.760]   So we know that is not good, right?
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.720]   But isolation of affect can also serve us very well.
[02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:00.600]   When I think back to being an intern,
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:02.360]   a medical intern in the hospital,
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:06.880]   and you might have to go and pronounce someone dead
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:11.160]   with hysterical family members.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:14.880]   And then 10 minutes later, five minutes later,
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:17.080]   maybe two minutes later, really,
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.220]   you have to go to another room
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:21.520]   and you've got to maybe do some procedure
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:25.260]   that involves having your focus on a certain thing
[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.260]   and making sure your hand movements are the right way
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:30.160]   or talking to a person in a way that is,
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:32.040]   that's very different than where you just came from,
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.040]   that's very hopeful.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.480]   And so then you have to isolate affect
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:36.880]   of what's going on around you.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:39.960]   And it happens not just in, it's just one example,
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.880]   but we have to do it in life
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:45.760]   so that we can put affect aside to process later
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.200]   or not feel the full weight of affect
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.400]   where we know the meaning.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.000]   Like I knew the meaning of the tragedy
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.960]   of the person I just pronounced dead,
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.720]   but I want to separate that from myself
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.680]   'cause I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.280]   so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.980]   and go do the next thing that I have to do.
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.520]   So that I think can cut both ways.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.360]   - Right, but then you have to reattach it,
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:11.300]   understand that it's good to be close with emotion,
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:14.440]   even painful emotion, right?
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.240]   Because that's the human experience.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.260]   I feel like if you build up a skill
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.700]   that you can detach yourself from emotion,
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:25.720]   I think that can become its own kind of--
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.240]   - Yeah. - Addictive qualities.
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:29.200]   - It can become too easy to do it, right?
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:30.520]   And to reinforce.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.320]   That's when people are suffering too much
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.760]   over too long a period of time,
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:38.360]   then we're creatures of habit, right?
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.160]   And even though our brains are,
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.080]   you can talk about our brains are sitting on the shoulders
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:46.040]   of the giant of the maybe thousand levels of emergence
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.680]   that come underneath of them,
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:51.960]   our brains also work in very simple habit-based ways.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:54.200]   Like if you and I chose a word right now
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.860]   and said it 500 times, we would know,
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.360]   it's just a silly experiment,
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:01.080]   but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:03.560]   Because our brains are also creatures of habit.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.700]   So if you over and over and over
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:08.240]   have to isolate yourself from affect
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.680]   and you develop those mechanisms,
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.520]   well, you develop those mechanisms
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.640]   and they don't go away any easier
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:17.160]   than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:19.260]   We won't forget no matter what we decided.
[02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:23.000]   - So how do we find our way back?
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:27.200]   How do we overcome trauma?
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.480]   What are the different pathways?
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.600]   - The first thing, the very first thing
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:35.560]   is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.760]   which might be one other person,
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:39.680]   it might be in words, spoken, it might be written,
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.360]   what the trauma has been, right?
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:47.360]   Because the lessons of trauma, the evil lessons of trauma,
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.600]   and I'll use the example of my own life,
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:54.320]   the lesson that told me that I was shameful,
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.720]   cursed, and hopeless, right?
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:00.720]   It's a very evil lesson, right?
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.640]   But my brain will say it over
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.160]   and did say it over and over and over to me.
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.960]   And if that just sits inside, that's how trauma festers,
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:12.320]   that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:16.040]   So being able to say to ourselves and to another,
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.520]   like, this is what's happened, right?
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.600]   Okay, this is what's happened.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:22.520]   We're built to massage words
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.320]   and to create meaning through words, right?
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.640]   Like we don't massage pictures, right, images.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.080]   We talk and massage meaning with words.
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.880]   So when I finally went to see a therapist
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.820]   and I could say, you know,
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:38.240]   my brother, whatever words I would have said,
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.240]   like he killed himself and I can't accept it
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.600]   or I can't imagine it and like, I let it happen.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.440]   Like, so I had to say those things, right?
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.680]   So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it.
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.560]   You know, and it was a long time ago,
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.200]   but the therapist probably said something like,
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.440]   okay, probably sees on you, you let it happen.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.280]   It's your fault, right?
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:09:59.960]   'Cause you gotta get at those things
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.740]   so that one can begin to bring into focus
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:06.920]   what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean?
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.080]   I mean, a classic example is the,
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.920]   what would you say to someone else example?
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.440]   You know, you'll say, well, I,
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:14.080]   now how many times have I,
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.200]   it's just, I could cry if I stop and think about it.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:17.920]   Now if you stop and talk to someone
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.280]   who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own,
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.820]   who comes in and tells the story
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:25.040]   they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:26.160]   They should have walked home a different way,
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.040]   they should have dressed differently,
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:28.560]   they should have left earlier, right?
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:31.440]   I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.080]   Now you have a person who,
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.180]   let's say you take a person who's intelligent,
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:38.400]   engaged in the world, who's like capable of understanding
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:39.680]   lots and lots and lots of things,
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.200]   but doesn't understand that, right?
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.020]   If it were someone else,
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:44.320]   that person would understand in a moment
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.520]   that's not that person's fault, right?
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.680]   So what you wanna do is overcome the fact
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.080]   that the negative emotions,
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:52.740]   the hijacked emotion systems of trauma
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.640]   are telling that person a lie,
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:59.400]   and they're telling them so strongly and so awfully,
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.400]   so meanly, that the person just takes it inside
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.560]   and starts to see it as true, right?
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.680]   So you begin to hold that up to the light of day.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:08.960]   And again, one example could be,
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.480]   oh, okay, so someone,
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:11.920]   the person who's coming in next
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.560]   has actually been through something similar, right?
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.160]   And do you mind, can you stay
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.880]   and just tell her how it's her fault, right?
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.480]   And like, oh my God, no, oh,
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.960]   because I could never, like, then they see, right?
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:23.760]   And again, this is not always how you do it,
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.000]   but sometimes you can get a person to see, like,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.360]   well, that would be the most horrible,
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:29.880]   how could you do that, right?
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:31.000]   And the person can maybe commit
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:31.960]   to doing it to themselves.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.400]   So you begin to put words in a structure and say,
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.360]   okay, let's look at what's going on inside of you.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.200]   You don't have to be scared
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:40.600]   of anything you're thinking and feeling.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.840]   In fact, the fear is in not exposing it
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:44.840]   to the light of day.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.600]   That's where it gets the best of us.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:48.800]   And now, like, everything is different.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.640]   And whether that involves use of medications
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.880]   for intrusive thoughts and depression,
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:56.080]   or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing,
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.800]   like, whatever it may be that comes next,
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:00.760]   the whole world has changed
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.120]   when the person has acknowledged what's happened,
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.840]   exposed it to themselves and to trusted others around them,
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:11.480]   and begun to look at it in some way
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.120]   other than the stuffed-in-an-evil-box place
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:17.880]   that the trauma initially puts us
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:20.480]   through the reflexes it creates in us.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.960]   - It's interesting that there's power
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.600]   to just saying it out loud.
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:24.560]   - Right.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.800]   - So first saying your perception of it out loud,
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.080]   then in that case, that might be your fault.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.880]   And then working out loud,
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:38.360]   working through that it may not be.
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.600]   - Any experienced therapist will tell you this,
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.000]   that every now and then it will happen
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.640]   that someone will come and they'll say something.
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:48.760]   Usually it's very early on in the process.
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.600]   They'll say something they've never said before,
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.920]   and they immediately are in an entirely different place,
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.840]   and they may have been for decades.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.920]   Right, and I can remember a person saying
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.840]   that a coach had raped him, and just saying it.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.840]   This was decades before, and everything was different.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.720]   I'm not saying everything is now as perfect,
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:10.000]   but his life was in a different place.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.160]   As soon as he said it, he could see how dare,
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:15.200]   like he thought that person did that to this child.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.440]   The child was me.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.520]   He never thought it until he said it out loud,
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.020]   'cause his mind was going over and over
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:22.680]   with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it,
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:25.920]   how he kept going back, so it must be his fault.
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:28.080]   It was in it, as soon as he put words to it,
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.800]   he saw the truth of it, and it was a bifurcation
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:32.920]   in the path of life then.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:35.340]   And any therapist has stories like that,
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.880]   which just shows the immense power
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:40.280]   that it can even be that just uttering the words
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:44.120]   makes just a cascade of change all at once.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.580]   - Just saying those words to another human being,
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:51.560]   it makes you wonder about that compulsive loop
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.200]   that happens in our heads.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:58.800]   Until it's brought to the surface, it's so interesting.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.600]   - Entirely non-productive, the loops,
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.040]   and sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.520]   Let me write it down, it can get rid of those loops
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:09.560]   in our brains, any even thought of outward expression
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:11.800]   is the enemy of those internal,
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.240]   persecutory negative thought loops.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:16.000]   - How do you find a good therapist?
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:22.320]   I tend to think of, listen, I'm a fan of podcasts,
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.720]   I'm a fan of conversations, it feels like a,
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.120]   it's like finding a good friend, or something.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:30.780]   It feels like a difficult journey.
[02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.520]   Maybe I'm wrong in that, but it just feels like such a,
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.560]   it feels like a partnership, a journey together,
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:43.560]   versus some very simple clinical procedure.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.880]   - Well, the first thing I would say is
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.840]   to change the entire paradigm.
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:50.120]   Most people, like okay, I need a therapist,
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.760]   so people feel often like they're in a weakened position
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:56.000]   because they need, quote unquote, a therapist.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.880]   Then therapists are rationed, right?
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:03.080]   I mean, how many insurance panels have lists a mile long
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:06.080]   of qualified therapists who could be
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.440]   on that insurance panel, but there's a certification process,
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.520]   like this just makes no sense, right?
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.660]   The state's already certified the person, right?
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.360]   But there's so many barriers to entry
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.840]   that now we're rationing this resource,
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:19.000]   which we should all stop and pause for a second
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.320]   and think like, we're okay with that as a society,
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.280]   and by the way, everything else is like that too,
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.440]   when we're trying to get help for our health.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.800]   So let's step back from that for a second.
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:30.840]   Now it's a resource that's not in great supply,
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:33.040]   and then a person begins to think,
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.760]   you know, essentially, I'll take what I can get,
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:35.720]   like I just gotta get somebody,
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:37.880]   and I don't know enough to know anyway, right?
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:40.520]   And those are very disempowering thoughts,
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:41.960]   as opposed to saying, look,
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:43.600]   I'm gonna be an empowered consumer,
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:47.560]   and I need to choose someone who gets over
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:49.760]   just some basic hurdles of what I think
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.960]   are reasonable human interaction, right?
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.640]   So like, is the person making eye contact?
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:55.040]   Do they seem interested, right?
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:57.600]   Like, these are basic points about any human interaction,
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.400]   including a therapist, right?
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.120]   Then you can say, okay, is there word of mouth?
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.280]   Anyone else has something good?
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.160]   Nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.920]   from someone you trust, right?
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:07.800]   Or anybody can have a good website,
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:09.120]   but you say, let me look at the website.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.840]   What is it saying if there is one, right?
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.480]   Does it resonate with me or not, right?
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.000]   But after all of that, then you go to see the person
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.720]   with the idea that you're interviewing them, right?
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.960]   The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me,
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.760]   and if so, great, I'm with the program,
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:27.120]   but I'm thinking about it.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.640]   Do I want this person?
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:29.760]   Do I feel heard?
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:31.480]   Do I feel cared for?
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:33.360]   Which doesn't mean, is it easy, right?
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.680]   It might mean, is it hard?
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.240]   And I leave, and I feel like,
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.960]   emotional for a couple of days,
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:41.640]   but I see that I'm facing new things.
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:43.720]   No, this process of assessment
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.760]   so that one isn't settling for something
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.920]   that is formulaic, over-packaged,
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:51.160]   and I'm not trying to be overly critical of therapists.
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.080]   I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.200]   and people who don't do their jobs well,
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:58.600]   but most therapists are working in systems
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.720]   that push against doing the job well, right?
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:03.000]   Because they're rationing care,
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.520]   and there's an allotted number of sessions,
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.080]   and there's enough such time before a person can return,
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.160]   and so often, it's an uphill battle
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:10.920]   because we're trying to be helped
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:14.280]   within systems we've created and tolerate
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.600]   that are pushing against helping us.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:23.000]   - Yeah, but that interview process is tricky.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.360]   I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally,
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.240]   just like with any kind of interview,
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.980]   it's hard not to think that a failed interaction,
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:37.400]   failed interview, there's something wrong with you.
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.760]   - Sure, right.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.960]   - There is an authority to a therapist, I think,
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.080]   where you think, like, they've got it all figured out.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:44.920]   - Right.
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:47.660]   - And I'm a mess, and therefore,
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:50.520]   if there's something off, it's all my fault.
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:53.000]   All right, so it's a very tricky,
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.320]   and it's easy to then give up,
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:57.760]   and then, 'cause that step to try to get a therapist,
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.120]   the first step, to get help,
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:01.880]   if I get a therapist, any kind of help,
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:04.040]   that's a big leap to take,
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:05.680]   especially when you're in a rough place.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:06.880]   - I agree completely.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.920]   We should not make people swim against
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:12.880]   such a strong current to get their needs met.
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.200]   I mean, we see this in such obvious places
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.280]   where an elderly homebound person
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:20.120]   who can't get their medicine
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.480]   because, oh, there's been some change,
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:22.520]   and they didn't put the new number
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.880]   into the form, or Lord knows what.
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.720]   I mean, it's incredible how we force people
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:30.800]   to swim against strong currents
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.960]   to get things that are just basic,
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.960]   at times, for their survival.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:38.260]   And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:41.960]   for where healthcare is at, or where mental health is at.
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:44.600]   The field that I work in has accepted
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:48.960]   all sorts of aspects of how things go,
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:50.360]   someone else controlling,
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:53.480]   how long the interaction can go on,
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:55.000]   how the interaction is bounded,
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.100]   what can be said and done,
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.120]   what medicines can be prescribed.
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:00.780]   There's so many external controls
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:03.940]   in the systems we work in that we,
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.880]   and I say me included, like all of us in the field,
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:09.760]   have let it get to a place
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:13.200]   where it's obscenely difficult to get help,
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.000]   obscenely difficult.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.880]   And we should say that's not okay.
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:21.780]   I think psychiatrists and therapists
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:23.920]   and master's level social workers,
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:25.600]   psychologists, and you name it,
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:29.440]   I think we should all say this is not okay,
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:32.080]   and then we as a society should be saying this is not okay.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.240]   Otherwise, what you're saying,
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:35.360]   which is, I think, completely true,
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:38.600]   will only become worse as there's more and more barriers
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.040]   to getting the help a person needs,
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:42.200]   and each time a person isn't helped,
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.560]   it sets the odds against them getting more help.
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.700]   I should say, Hugh, that when I started working,
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:50.120]   there were times I would send people to an emergency room,
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:51.800]   right, if there was some emergency,
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:54.160]   emergency in their mental health, and they were at risk.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:56.480]   And there were times I'd send somebody to an emergency room
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:58.160]   where if you stopped and looked,
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:01.320]   it would have been malpractice not to do that, right?
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.320]   Now, it's not just me who has an incredibly high threshold
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:09.880]   for sending someone to an emergency room
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:12.520]   because you send someone who's in a lot of distress,
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:15.420]   and oftentimes, they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway,
[02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:17.440]   or they're locked in a small white room,
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:18.840]   and all they had was depression.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:20.680]   You know, they're just scared when they go in,
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.320]   and 36 hours later, oh, they're feeling a little better.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:24.160]   Why?
[02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:24.980]   Because they're desperate to get out of there,
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:26.240]   and someone sends them home.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.800]   I mean, so our systems have shifted so much
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.160]   that we tolerate now, en masse,
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:35.340]   what is egregious to the individual.
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:39.640]   - So you are a psychiatrist.
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:43.720]   In terms of doing therapy, psychotherapy,
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:47.240]   what does the successful interaction look like?
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:50.600]   Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:51.840]   What do you think of the psychiatrist,
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:55.360]   Sean and Goodwill Hunting, played by Robin Williams?
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.120]   So what is the full range of interesting interactions?
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:20:59.800]   Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.560]   a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:09.320]   of, you know, 30-minute session once a week or whatever,
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:14.320]   versus like a really kind of deliberate, long-term project
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:17.720]   that cares about the well-being of a person
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:20.200]   across the months and years?
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:24.680]   Or what can you say about a successful interaction
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.920]   between therapist and patient?
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:30.160]   - I think we're much better served by the latter, right?
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:32.280]   And again, it doesn't have to be over years.
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:34.920]   I mean, maybe a person might need that over weeks.
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.020]   They might need it over months.
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.720]   They might need it over years.
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.760]   But if I'm understanding correctly,
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:41.960]   you're describing something that is
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.520]   like a real human engagement, right?
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:49.120]   And I work in a field that for years and years and years,
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:51.480]   the patient didn't get to see, right?
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:53.200]   The therapist was sitting in a place,
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:54.920]   sitting behind the person, right?
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.400]   So that's not, of course, the only tradition,
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.400]   and there are aspects of that tradition
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:01.000]   that can be very humanized.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.560]   But the idea that we're supposed to not be human,
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:06.520]   I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right?
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:07.760]   That the doctor's supposed to be God
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:09.200]   and it protects the doctor.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:11.120]   And that makes its way into therapy.
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:13.560]   And the idea of the superiority,
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:15.040]   the therapist knows more.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:18.400]   I mean, in some ways, yes,
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:21.640]   but the idea is to know more about mechanical things,
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:25.040]   right, to know more about facts and knowledge,
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:26.680]   not as a human being, right?
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:30.720]   If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor,
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:33.100]   right, where if we're gonna do it together,
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:35.320]   of course I'm gonna learn from you too, right?
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:36.640]   I mean, we're two human beings
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.240]   and we're talking about things that are deep
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:39.360]   and personal and intimate,
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.960]   and I'm not gonna participate in a way
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:45.200]   that makes it about me as much as it's about you,
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:47.920]   but we're two humans and what's going on in me
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:50.440]   may have relevance and sharing it may have relevance.
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:53.580]   And at times, you doing something back for me
[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.680]   may have relevance.
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:56.000]   I'll give you an example of a person
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.560]   who would not let me help him.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.560]   It was a young man, so when I was in training,
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.920]   who was very, very sick and needed to change
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.760]   certain choices and habits,
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:07.520]   or he was not gonna survive.
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:11.600]   And I had no ability to help him whatsoever.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.280]   And I went and I saw a supervisor
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:14.760]   who was existentially trained,
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.840]   where here it's different from existentialism
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:17.880]   in the classic sense,
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:20.400]   but it's about really human connection, right?
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.240]   And the guy was always wanting to teach me something,
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:25.100]   right, 'cause I can get by in Spanish,
[02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:26.360]   but he was fluent in Spanish.
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.840]   And he wanted to, oh, you traveled here
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:31.520]   and he'd say a word to see if I knew.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.000]   And I was always directing back
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.260]   to what I was supposed to do, right?
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:35.680]   And the supervisor, I'll never forget,
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:37.840]   he said, "Let him teach you Spanish."
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:39.280]   Like, okay, come on.
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:41.160]   So we had a couple sessions where if you look
[02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:43.000]   from the outside, you say, what is going on there?
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.880]   Like, right, like, they were Spanish lessons to me, right?
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:49.360]   And then at some point, he brought in his mother
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.400]   and we hadn't brought her in yet,
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:53.760]   and he was in part showing off
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:55.120]   that he taught me something, right?
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:58.120]   And I said a couple things and he felt more powerful.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.080]   Like, he was younger than me
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:01.340]   and he felt sick and disempowered,
[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:03.920]   but he didn't feel that way once he taught me something
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:06.160]   and we showed it off to his mother, right?
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:07.860]   And his behavior started to change.
[02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:10.040]   He started taking better care of himself.
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:11.920]   He could see a little more what I was saying.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:13.320]   It was like, you're a wonderful person.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.840]   Look, you love your mother and your aunt and they love you.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.360]   And like, he could start seeing that about himself.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:20.120]   But that came from humanness.
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:23.720]   And I think that's the way we help people.
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:25.760]   I don't understand why we don't do everything that way.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:27.640]   It's like, we're two humans,
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:29.120]   but if you're doing something for me,
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:31.400]   then there's something, you have an expertise and I don't,
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:32.800]   that's why you're doing it for me.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:34.020]   The reverse could be true,
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:36.300]   but it doesn't mean we're not just two humans
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.720]   doing something together.
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:39.800]   - And the healthcare system and the legal system
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:40.880]   should not get in the way of that.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.440]   I mean, there's liability and all these kinds of things
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:48.340]   that can get in the way of the humanness.
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:50.680]   I mean, some of that is justified.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:51.560]   You have to be careful.
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:52.760]   You have to make sure there's--
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:53.760]   - Of course.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.440]   - Irresponsible, but a little too much
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.880]   can destroy the humanness.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:00.760]   - I'll use a way to usually say something is insane.
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:02.480]   Like, it's not consistent with sanity.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.320]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:06.520]   - And the presence of the legal system,
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:09.280]   look, I'm all for, of course, physicians have to be held,
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.080]   but to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:15.080]   and people have to be accountable for their mistakes.
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:18.980]   I understand all of that, but what we see now,
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:23.980]   it's so absurd that, oh, like everyone is frightened.
[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.080]   - Yeah.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:26.800]   - Everyone is frightened and just looking to,
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:28.240]   like, how do I slot into the box,
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:31.000]   check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.620]   and not get in trouble?
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:36.180]   You know, people get sued because someone was
[02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:38.600]   at that hospital and that doctor touched their care.
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:39.760]   This happens in the VA system.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.520]   It happens in other systems, too.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.840]   So you might have touched their care
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:44.520]   and no one's even saying you did anything wrong,
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.960]   but they say the next person did.
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:47.640]   Oh, someone settled on your behalf
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:49.360]   and now you have a malpractice.
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:51.820]   Ding, and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else.
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:54.800]   Like, doctors are terrified and they're terrified
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:58.480]   for good reason because the same society
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:00.480]   that has given doctors, in many ways,
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:03.440]   too much power over time and treated doctors
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.800]   maybe too much like gods, now is, I think,
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:08.920]   enacting some of society's anger and envy
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:10.600]   out on the physicians.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:13.760]   Even the idea that, like, a person would know what medicine.
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:16.440]   Like, I saw a couple TV commercials, give me this.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:18.600]   Like, it's interesting, right?
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:21.600]   Because even if, let's say I take my self-advice,
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:24.520]   it doesn't feel good, obviously, but it's like, wow.
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:26.560]   Like, I went to school for like eight years for this
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.520]   and you don't even wanna hear my opinion, right?
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:30.400]   You're not taking good care of yourself, right?
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.440]   It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:35.240]   'cause I said it, but people then don't
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:37.640]   have an understanding of, like, what is expertise?
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.120]   What do people learn?
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:42.760]   How can people help us understand and make better decisions?
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.480]   It kinda goes out with the wash
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:47.560]   and then the position of the expert,
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.920]   I mean, a lot has been written about this, right,
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.840]   gets diminished over time very much to our own peril.
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.080]   And then often with aggression in the medical world
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.880]   coming back towards the alleged expert.
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:01.880]   - Yeah, expertise is a tricky one.
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.920]   It's such a tricky thing
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.920]   because coupled with expertise,
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:12.960]   the attention is this arrogance
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.880]   that can come with expertise.
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:18.040]   The arrogance can make the expert feel
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:19.600]   like they're more of an expert.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:22.040]   And it's a vicious cycle.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:25.000]   And then the arrogance in the current, in the 21st century,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:25.960]   especially with the internet,
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:29.640]   the arrogance can completely force the public
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.800]   to distrust the expert 'cause it always sees
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:33.960]   the arrogance versus the expertise.
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.720]   So ultimately you have to have, I think,
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:41.080]   the greatest experts and masters I know
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:44.280]   are the ones that have complete humility.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:45.800]   - Right, humility and gratitude.
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.240]   - And gratitude. - Leads us back.
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:49.400]   - Which is usually a really good sign
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.240]   that somebody is at the top of their field.
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:54.520]   - Right, and they'll acknowledge
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.600]   that they don't know everything.
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.320]   - Right, which is hilarious, right?
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:00.200]   So like the best experts I know
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.200]   are the ones that will say that they don't know.
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:06.400]   - Right. - They will not
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.080]   call themselves an expert.
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:09.200]   - Right, right.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.040]   It's very confusing.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:12.200]   - Or know that they know a lot
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:13.400]   but don't know the answer to this.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.560]   You see that a lot in medicine.
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.640]   That person knows they're an expert surgeon,
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:18.440]   but they also acknowledge they don't know
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:20.200]   if this is the right time to operate.
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:21.720]   That's how you get to the best answer
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:23.200]   instead of someone who is an expert
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.520]   and always knows the answer.
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:27.000]   - Yeah, if we actually rewind
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.880]   to the beginning of our conversation,
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:31.520]   we talked about, you mentioned something
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.320]   I wanted to return to.
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.480]   So there's layers that are,
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.800]   there's an emergent novelty,
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:40.640]   and you mentioned that we as human beings,
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:43.920]   and we introspect on our own mind,
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:46.140]   we really can't know most of it.
[02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:50.080]   Which of course makes me think of this,
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:52.480]   the unconscious mind, subconscious mind,
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.520]   and Carl Jung, how much is hiding there in the shadows?
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:58.880]   You've investigated a lot of trauma.
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.800]   How much is there in our mind
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.440]   that's not directly accessible to us?
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:06.440]   Like what can you say maybe philosophically
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:11.440]   about how much is there lurking in the Jungian shadow?
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.800]   - I think there's a tremendous amount there,
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:18.960]   but I wouldn't, I don't immediately go
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:21.880]   to an ominous perspective, right?
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:23.360]   Because if it's lurking there, right,
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.640]   it can come get us, right?
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:26.720]   And to some extent, that's true, right?
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:28.280]   You can say that the seeds of evil are there
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:29.920]   if we want to plant and nurture them.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.120]   - You think good things can't lurk?
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:32.960]   - I guess, I was--
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.800]   - I was being poetic.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:35.880]   But you're right, you're absolutely right.
[02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:37.440]   And the Jungian shadow is supposed
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:38.600]   to not just be dark things,
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:39.440]   it's supposed to be everything.
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:42.040]   It's supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:43.680]   - Right, which I think brings us
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:46.000]   to self-knowledge, to truth,
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.240]   where I think the opposite of envy,
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:53.480]   narcissism, sociopathy, I do think is all rooted in truth.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:55.880]   It's both the truth of the good things about us
[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:59.080]   or the ways we're not blameable,
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:01.200]   blameworthy for the things we're blaming ourselves for,
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.680]   et cetera, but the self-knowledge and the truth
[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:08.400]   and getting away from the reflex of anger,
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:12.100]   frustration, envy, shame, what I think happens then
[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:14.260]   is all of that underneath the surface.
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.800]   If we look at the consciousness as the top of the iceberg,
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:19.660]   you know, outside the top, outside the water,
[02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:22.240]   so is what's underneath shifting
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:24.120]   and it can pull the top under, right,
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.040]   or is it supporting the top?
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.200]   And really, I believe is honesty, truth,
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:32.080]   self-knowledge, humility, gratitude,
[02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:33.320]   all this simple stuff.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:36.560]   Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:39.560]   You know, humility, gratitude are easy things to say.
[02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.240]   Like, we know what that is, right?
[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:42.640]   We understand what that is.
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:46.360]   Soothing envy by having immense power
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:49.000]   and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated,
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.520]   right, what that is and how that plays out.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:54.160]   So if we are in touch with ourselves,
[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:57.240]   if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours,
[02:30:57.240 --> 02:30:59.640]   we don't try and own what's not ours, right,
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:02.320]   what happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:06.720]   to sort of jump us with some new fact of self
[02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:08.380]   or challenge of self, right?
[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:10.760]   Then I think what happens are phenomena
[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:13.440]   like intrinsic learning, like the way that so much happens
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:15.520]   inside of us automatically, right?
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:18.840]   How people who have high levels of expertise
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:23.760]   know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right?
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:25.720]   It doesn't take them longer to think through it,
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:27.440]   but they have more knowledge to think through.
[02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:30.580]   It's that more happens rapidly and unconsciously,
[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:33.300]   so they know the more complex answer
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:35.180]   more quickly and readily, right?
[02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:37.040]   And we can build that in ourselves,
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.440]   not just in terms of factual knowledge,
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:42.240]   but in terms of how we respond to things, right?
[02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:45.760]   If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame,
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:47.600]   right, if I see someone has something I'd like,
[02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:49.120]   how do I respond?
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:51.760]   We're more in accord with ourselves
[02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:56.440]   and then the automaticity in us is serving us better.
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.480]   - So that's in the positive.
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.320]   Do you think, do you draw some wisdom
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:03.780]   from the early pioneers of psychotherapy
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:05.800]   like Freud and Jung?
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:06.640]   - Yes.
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:07.600]   - That there's some repressed,
[02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:12.400]   there's some stuff to work through
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:15.720]   that is in the unconscious mind.
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:17.800]   - Yes, I think there's always,
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:21.400]   like 100% of the time, if you have a living human,
[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:24.380]   you have things to work through in the unconscious mind,
[02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:26.520]   right, there's too much that goes on around us
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:30.160]   that we might find unacceptable and suppress, right?
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:33.760]   There can be smaller but important examples, right?
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:38.480]   Someone who feels that they're not a good enough parent
[02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:43.480]   and they, I don't know, they drop the child's plate, right,
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:48.680]   and there's a feeling about that of badness in them
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.440]   that the person can't tolerate and pushes away, right,
[02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:55.440]   and maybe they become a little bit less confident,
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.120]   a little bit less assertive.
[02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:59.640]   Those small examples are important
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:01.160]   because they may be low valence
[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:04.200]   but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right?
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:06.160]   Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:08.320]   where someone, for example, feels,
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:12.400]   or they're repressing their sexuality, right, unconsciously.
[02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:15.120]   Something that is so important,
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:16.880]   say, to how a person feels about themselves,
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:18.320]   to whether they can seek fulfillment,
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.800]   to how they feel about their ability to interact
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:23.000]   and engage with others in ways that are loving
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.760]   and generative over time.
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:29.400]   So from smaller things that accumulate often at rapid pace
[02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:30.840]   to really big things,
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:33.160]   we are pushing things into the unconscious
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.480]   because they're not acceptable and we need to explore,
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.960]   like, why is that not acceptable?
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.400]   Maybe there's an unacceptable urge
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.360]   'cause it's really not acceptable to me, right,
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:42.640]   like a violent urge.
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:44.700]   Maybe there's an unacceptable urge
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:47.160]   because I'm actually listening to the lies
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:49.040]   society is telling me about what's okay
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:50.460]   and what's not okay, right?
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:52.600]   So in exploring those things,
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.880]   yes, we become happier and healthier
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:57.920]   and that could mean if we're already happy and healthy,
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:01.160]   it gets better, we get more insulated against the negative,
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:03.600]   or it can mean the person who's really nurturing
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.480]   some of those seeds of evil and envy
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:08.800]   does that less or steps away from it.
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:10.360]   So whether it's good or it's bad,
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:12.360]   it's in there inside of us
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:15.160]   and we benefit from understanding
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:16.840]   that idea of the observing ego, right?
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.680]   Like you said, the part that can stop and say,
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:22.200]   hey, this is what's, I see what's going on in me.
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:25.280]   - What have you learned about exploring the human mind
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:27.440]   about the art of conversation?
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:29.480]   'Cause ultimately, therapy is conversation.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.520]   - Yeah.
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:33.200]   - Is there something you can put into words?
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:34.040]   - Yeah.
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.320]   - Like what makes a good conversation?
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:41.600]   - I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:45.320]   and it's also one of the most clunky routes
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:47.000]   to misunderstanding, right?
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.320]   I think of like, there's a concept of facticity,
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:51.800]   things that are like, I guess, unnecessary evils
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:52.920]   from the religious perspective,
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.480]   I think is where the word started,
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:57.360]   but of language being like a facticity, right?
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:59.540]   That we need to communicate with one another,
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:01.580]   we wanna communicate, so we develop words
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:03.680]   and we have these amazing brains that can have language
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.600]   and that's all well and good,
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:08.560]   but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right?
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.960]   You know, the Vulcan mind meld,
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.480]   where it's like, I communicate with you
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:12.800]   'cause we put our hands on one another
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:15.000]   and we know, you know, by doing this,
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.300]   what we're thinking and what we're feeling
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:19.500]   and we won't have misunderstanding.
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:22.440]   So because I think we can approximate that,
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:25.320]   we can come kind of close with language, right?
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:28.100]   Or we can be so far away from it
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:31.240]   that we can say the same word and of opposite meanings
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:33.960]   and have it generate immediate animosity, right?
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.320]   That we need to be very, very careful
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:40.240]   with language, with communication, with conversations.
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:43.240]   And I've come to understand that much, much more
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.440]   as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful,
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:49.840]   you know, reckless speech is,
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.760]   which is why I'm horrified by so much
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:53.840]   of what we see in our political discourse, right?
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.200]   The slurs, the negativity that's attached to something,
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:00.160]   to some word, you know, how one can utter something
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:02.880]   and it can go into another person's just into the ear,
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:04.480]   but then goes through so many parts
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:05.460]   of the meaning of the brain
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:07.360]   that that person feels a pervasive sense
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:10.400]   of shame or beleagueredness, right?
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:14.960]   So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:16.780]   and we see that all the time in ways
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:18.520]   that I think are just atrocious.
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:22.480]   And also how bad miscommunication harms us.
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:24.400]   I mean, I really learned that through a lot
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.460]   of different ways, but in the work as a therapist
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:28.480]   of like really wanting to make sure
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.520]   that I'm really understanding you
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.440]   and you're really understanding me.
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:34.800]   And a lot of work goes into that communication.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:36.400]   I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:38.080]   and then it happens more easily,
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.320]   but I think it's a life and death difference at times,
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.040]   you know, lots of times, right, in the world around us
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.280]   between clear and accurate communication.
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:49.320]   Just so I said a word because I think you know what I mean,
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:50.960]   or something like that.
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:54.600]   - Yeah, so to that, I mean, there's the Camus quote
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:58.240]   that I like, "As much unhappiness has come into the world
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:00.360]   "because of things left unsaid."
[02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:05.060]   So that has to do with clear communication.
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:11.520]   But there's also a dance to a conversation,
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:15.200]   a poetry to it.
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.680]   There is ambiguity to language.
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:20.560]   And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:23.440]   and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in.
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:27.600]   That allows you to sneak up to difficult topics
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:30.400]   without sort of trampling on them.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:34.120]   I don't know, there's an art to it as well.
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:36.320]   There's an art to the silence, you know?
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:40.260]   Just allowing both human beings,
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:41.840]   one of the most intimate things you can share
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.440]   with a human being is silence.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:45.440]   - Yeah, that's communication.
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:46.720]   It's a different communication,
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:48.800]   but at times more powerful.
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:53.260]   - Yeah, giving a person space to accumulate,
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:55.960]   to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.440]   enough to say a word.
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:59.620]   Maybe a memory sparks so they can think
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:03.200]   about that memory and process that memory.
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:04.520]   - So it's not just words, right?
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:05.400]   It's not just words, right?
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:06.680]   'Cause now you're talking about communication
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:11.040]   as it's body language, it's expressions of empathy,
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.320]   it's movements, it's pauses, right?
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.760]   The communication process is very,
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:18.640]   very complicated and deep.
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:20.760]   - Yeah, and some of that is building trust,
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.880]   but also challenging a person.
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:25.760]   I wonder about that whole process with strangers,
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.480]   for example, of how you do that successfully.
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:31.640]   Like you and I just met today,
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:37.240]   but I think a lot of our interaction is very free.
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:39.760]   We can get to know each other in any way we want.
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:43.400]   There's a few conversations I have coming up in general
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.620]   where there's a lot of other pressures and constraints
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:46.640]   on those conversations.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:49.760]   There's a danger to it, there's risks,
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.600]   there's political forces involved.
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:56.180]   Not from my perspective, but probably from mine as well,
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:58.140]   of how do you say this thing?
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:00.480]   What are the words that are going to offend?
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:03.720]   And you're learning that about a stranger at the same time.
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:10.800]   It's an interesting dance because you have to walk
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:12.680]   carefully but deliberately, right?
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:17.120]   Carefully because I've learned this about myself,
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:20.080]   about others, there's certain words
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:21.560]   that can trigger a person,
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.520]   that can make a person feel poorly,
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:28.080]   like shitty about themselves.
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:33.300]   So you can push, you can challenge a person about something
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:34.740]   and they're totally okay with it,
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.700]   but if you use a certain word to do it,
[02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:40.200]   maybe it maps to some childhood thing
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.620]   that their father or mother used to say
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:42.820]   or something like this.
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:46.980]   Part of the art of conversation is actually
[02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:50.060]   being a little bit free in using those words,
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:53.020]   but being extremely sensitive in detecting
[02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:55.520]   when a person reacts to a particular word
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:57.520]   and storing that away.
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.520]   It's like, okay, we might want to return to that later
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:03.160]   'cause there might be an interesting,
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:04.400]   that could be a tip of an iceberg
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:06.560]   that's actually representing something beautiful.
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:09.720]   Or you might want to just, it's a nothing word
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:12.640]   that you just want to avoid because it's a distraction.
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:15.040]   And so all of that kind of has to be integrated
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:16.240]   into the dance of language.
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:17.520]   This is really interesting,
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:19.080]   especially when the stakes are really high.
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:20.580]   When you get one conversation,
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.300]   when you sit down, you have one conversation,
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:27.260]   and it makes the difference between,
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:29.220]   say you had one conversation with a patient.
[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:31.380]   This is the only conversation you get to help them.
[02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:33.980]   - Sometimes it is the case, yeah.
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:35.660]   - This is pretty high stakes.
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:37.460]   - Yeah. - Oh, man.
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:39.700]   Yeah, it's tough.
[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:40.820]   I guess you get over,
[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:45.540]   and over time, I guess you get used
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:48.300]   to the high stakes nature of it.
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:49.780]   - When you develop an ability.
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:51.700]   With all that unconscious processing, right?
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:52.600]   - Right, right.
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:55.140]   All that part of the iceberg that's underneath the surface
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:56.240]   is doing all of that, right?
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:59.000]   It's reading behavioral cues, verbal cues,
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.720]   and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right?
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.760]   If it were all logic, it'd be different.
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:06.860]   Okay, we're gonna talk about this thing.
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:08.360]   I'll say things, you say things back,
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.520]   even if it's politically contentious, say.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:12.040]   So, okay, we're just gonna talk logically.
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:13.840]   But you know, that's not the case, right?
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.360]   There could be a word that raises a certain emotion,
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:18.800]   and you know you don't want to tread there
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:20.280]   because the emotion will color
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:22.380]   the person's ability to engage.
[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:24.580]   So, you're aware of all of this.
[02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:27.260]   And then I think from the perspective of all of that,
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:29.420]   I mean, it's like standing on the shoulders
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.620]   of your own internal giant, right?
[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:34.940]   That understands language and emotions
[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:36.900]   and body language and attunement
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:40.020]   and history and triggering and all of that.
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:41.860]   And then on top of that,
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:43.260]   as you're standing up on those shoulders,
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.460]   you're trying to be effective, right?
[02:41:45.460 --> 02:41:48.280]   And then I think that's where effectiveness
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:51.140]   can be unilateral or it can be together.
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:53.660]   I mean, I think some of what emerged
[02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:56.260]   from Viktor Frankl's writing after the Second World War
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:00.260]   was how much a shared humanness means to us,
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:02.820]   how much of that can be an incentive
[02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:05.420]   for survival beyond all others, right?
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:07.940]   So, the idea of are we doing something,
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:09.540]   if we're communicating unilateral,
[02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:12.500]   like I want information from you
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:14.580]   or I want you to do a certain thing
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:16.260]   when we're done talking, right?
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:17.860]   Right, done communicating.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.760]   That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness,
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:21.760]   which can make sense.
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:23.440]   Sometimes I want information out of a patient
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:25.040]   because I wanna know what to do next, right?
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:26.920]   So, it doesn't have to always be negative,
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:29.360]   but it can also be a tool of manipulation, right?
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:31.840]   If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism,
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:33.680]   I wanna communicate with you in a way
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:36.000]   that makes you do what I want you to do, right?
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.540]   Different from that is where it's a shared communication,
[02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:42.680]   where there's like an umbrella, so to speak, over us
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:46.040]   and we're doing something that can only happen together
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:48.380]   because we're us, we're each person, right?
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:50.360]   And we come together to do something
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.880]   that's a shared effectiveness.
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:54.520]   Like I think we're doing now of like elucidating
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:57.360]   and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out.
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:59.400]   And I think the best situations
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:01.240]   are shared effectiveness situations
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:03.200]   'cause you call upon the resourcefulness
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:05.960]   and the internal resources of both people.
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.320]   - But you, especially with strangers,
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:12.060]   especially when it's not labeled a therapy session,
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:18.400]   you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state.
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.720]   Like you have to organically develop a trust together
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:30.400]   and almost lose yourself.
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:32.360]   Ultimately, I think you put it really nice.
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:34.080]   I think successful conversations,
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.760]   even when it's with, like even if it's like
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:40.600]   with world leaders or logicians,
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:42.720]   people that operate in the space of reason,
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:46.200]   the most successful conversation will ultimately be
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:49.920]   in the layer, in the landscape of emotion.
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:52.240]   Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen.
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:53.760]   That's where you'll discover anything.
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:55.520]   And that's where you get to actually meet,
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:58.000]   to start getting an understanding of each other,
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.440]   or what you actually mean, even by the statements
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:04.240]   that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:06.920]   It's like you lose yourself.
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:10.400]   You lose yourself in the way you do when you're children
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:12.140]   and you're just shooting the shit
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:14.720]   about whatever topic and you just forget yourself.
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:15.560]   Forget the things you're supposed to say.
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:17.120]   - You lose yourself in the context, right?
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:19.120]   - Yeah, where you kind of plug
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:21.840]   into the unconscious mind a little bit
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:24.720]   and you get to speak, maybe indirectly,
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:27.940]   but to the things that really drive you,
[02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:30.560]   to the thing that really, to the things,
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:35.160]   to the emotions, I suppose, that underlie your worldview.
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:38.840]   I feel like that's where productive conversations
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:40.360]   can happen, whether it's a patient
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:43.940]   or just a stranger you're talking to at a bar
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.180]   about geopolitics.
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:47.780]   You mentioned Viktor Frankl.
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:50.420]   What do you make of his work, "Man's Search for Meaning"?
[02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:53.500]   What are the lessons you draw from his work,
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:56.500]   of him as a psychologist, but also from that,
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:59.500]   a very powerful work that reflects on his experience
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:02.020]   in a Nazi concentration camp?
[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:07.020]   - Yeah, I think that it was almost a profound reinvention
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:14.140]   of humanness, right, after something so awful,
[02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:20.260]   so bleak and so despairing, to speak anew
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:25.620]   about shared humanness, human connection,
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:30.260]   meaning, compassion, that I think it was
[02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:34.760]   an intellectual direction that was adorned
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:37.400]   with all of the emotions that we need
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:41.600]   to adorn the logic with in order to make real change
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:43.860]   in the world, and I think that his work
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:48.860]   has fueled so many branches, have come from his work,
[02:45:48.860 --> 02:45:52.460]   the existential psychotherapy and its place
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:55.980]   in helping human activities today, right,
[02:45:55.980 --> 02:46:02.140]   a trend away from the idea that we're all quite isolated
[02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:04.240]   and that what's going on between us
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:05.780]   is all very transactional, right?
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:07.240]   I'm putting something out and you take it in,
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:08.980]   you put something out, I take it in, right?
[02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:10.520]   The idea that no, there's a difference there,
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:13.820]   there's a shared humanness that creates a meaning
[02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:16.300]   beyond the transactional, kind of like you were just saying,
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:18.720]   the logical stuff isn't really that interesting
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:21.480]   because the logic is, there's an answer
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:23.740]   to whatever logic is, we can do math, right?
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:27.360]   It's where does the surprises come in, right,
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:30.680]   either in terms of wonderful behavior
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.180]   or destructive behavior, right,
[02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:33.980]   they're coming from people's emotions,
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:36.520]   so that's what we want to understand,
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:39.120]   and that occurs in the context of a person
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:41.520]   and other humans, even if it's the conception
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:44.820]   of someone and other humans as enemy,
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:49.160]   or it's the conception of two people sitting together,
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:51.000]   the idea that there's a shared humanness
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.840]   and it's not all transactional,
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:57.840]   and that he could take that out of a pinnacle
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:01.300]   of human tragedy and utilize it in a way
[02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:05.740]   that informs us being better as a species going forward,
[02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:08.000]   I think is really monumental.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.680]   - What do you think is the role of emotion
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:14.980]   in the human mind, in the human condition?
[02:47:14.980 --> 02:47:19.980]   Because we've talked several times in different ways
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:23.800]   that emotion matters and it's a big part of who we are,
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:30.320]   but why is it there, why is it useful, what's good about it?
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:35.400]   We've almost said it's almost like a negative thing
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:37.340]   that we just have to live with,
[02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:39.640]   but why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:42.080]   - Yeah, well I think you said, what's the role of emotion?
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:44.440]   Emotion is the king, if we want to use that analogy,
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.000]   it's the CEO, if we want to use that analogy.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.880]   Emotion rules all.
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:51.680]   We're taught that we're logical creatures,
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:54.040]   but we have innumerable pieces of data,
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.900]   even over the course of just a day,
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:57.720]   let alone a human experience,
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:47:59.440]   to tell us that is not the truth.
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:02.440]   Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:04.280]   No, right?
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:06.080]   I mean, logic's never gonna tell one to do that.
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.480]   Okay, someone you love is in the building.
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:10.560]   The person's already sprinted halfway to the building.
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:15.560]   Emotion rules us, and so the thought, a thought,
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:18.800]   is some of that is evolutionary,
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:21.960]   that strong negative emotion stays with us
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:24.180]   very, very profoundly.
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:26.760]   So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:29.080]   and I find a new berry and it tastes good
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:33.040]   and it seems nutritious, and it is, everything's fine.
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:34.760]   It'd be good to remember that, right?
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.600]   But if I find a new berry and it tastes good
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:39.040]   and it seems nutritious, and we both eat it
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:43.240]   and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:47.320]   So the primacy of emotion is in us
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:49.860]   for reasons that are about survival,
[02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:52.400]   that the emotion of it's my child in that building
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:55.160]   or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:56.800]   and run into the building, right?
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:58.840]   The emotion of I thought that was good
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:01.400]   and I got really sick and I better never forget
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:02.920]   is also about survival.
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:04.320]   And the same applies to humans.
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:06.640]   If we're from different tribes back then,
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:09.200]   and in my tribe when you put your hand out,
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:10.360]   it's a greeting.
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:13.080]   In your tribe, if someone puts their hand out,
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:16.040]   it means, hey, I'm gonna attack you and take your stuff.
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:19.600]   Then I put my hand out and you slug me, right?
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:22.400]   Then I better remember that, right?
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.760]   But you see how that can lead into
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:27.320]   the constructs around that.
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:30.120]   I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right?
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:33.040]   We start then to make stories around that.
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.480]   But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:37.440]   or it's humans who might threaten us
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.320]   or it's humans we love, I think it's hard
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:42.960]   to even look at the anthropological,
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.040]   psychological literature to look at what's out there
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:49.600]   and I think the face validity, that's part of survival.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:50.760]   Right, it's part of survival.
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:53.760]   - But it's so cool that you get also things like love,
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:57.600]   which are not often rational or grounded in logic and so on.
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.940]   If you look from a transactional perspective,
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:03.520]   a lot of times falling in love,
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:09.440]   whether it's with friends or friendship or romantic love,
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:10.920]   it doesn't really make sense.
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:14.440]   I'm still not sure what the hell it is.
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:15.280]   (laughing)
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:20.120]   'Cause it's the thing that is one of the things,
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:22.960]   or love for your kids when they're born,
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:25.960]   that love, the parental love,
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:29.360]   what is that?
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:31.360]   That's so cool that we get to have,
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:34.920]   if you're looking in the menu of items
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:37.720]   that give life meaning, that seems like a pretty good one.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:40.840]   - Yeah, so my response, you just said
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:42.100]   that it gives life meaning.
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:43.640]   My response initially was gonna be,
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.800]   it's the meaning of life, right?
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:48.160]   Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival,
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:49.760]   that's one part, right?
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:50.980]   And it's a very important part, right?
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:53.860]   If we don't survive, then we're not there
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:55.040]   to have emotions, right?
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:58.800]   So yes, it's about survival, but as important as that is,
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.440]   that's the small part of it, right?
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.800]   I think it is about the meaning of life
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:04.920]   because it's about the beyond self.
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:07.640]   And I think it relates back to what we talked,
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:08.800]   we were talking about at the very beginning
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:11.480]   and the levels of emergence, right?
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:14.560]   And when we feel love, we feel happiness
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:17.320]   because that person feels happiness, right?
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:19.120]   There's something that's so generative,
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:20.480]   so creative about that.
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:22.240]   Like we wanna bring order to things
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:26.080]   and happiness is consistent with simplicity, right?
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:27.560]   If we're healthy, there's nothing negative
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:28.720]   to say about our health, right?
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:30.880]   If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right?
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:35.280]   And it's emotion that pushes us towards the goodness
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:38.000]   that I think makes all the meaning for us.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.360]   I mean, it's interesting, I actually was wondering
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:42.480]   your thoughts about this as a scientist, right?
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:45.800]   Because we accept it by and large that we have free will,
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:47.160]   right, we feel that we have free will,
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:49.600]   but then we get upset that there's not justice, right?
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:52.400]   So, but how is it like if we have free will,
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:55.240]   I could act in an unjust way and then you're surprised
[02:51:55.240 --> 02:51:57.040]   or vice versa, why, right?
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:59.800]   We have these thoughts because I think
[02:51:59.800 --> 02:52:03.160]   because we're rooted, we want logic to rule.
[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:04.800]   Like there's a way in which I can understand logic,
[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:06.720]   I can manage it, I can manipulate it.
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:08.880]   We sort of want it to be that way.
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:13.880]   So then we glorify logic and then we misapply it.
[02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:16.440]   Like ideas like, oh, I know we have free will,
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:19.200]   but I'm now shaking my fist at the heavens
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:21.200]   because there's no justice, right?
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.920]   And I think maybe what we're looking for is
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:25.500]   we should go back and look at the givens.
[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.960]   Like why is there there's only goodness if there's justice?
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:30.880]   I mean, that doesn't make, I think the goodness,
[02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:32.760]   why does the goodness have to be tied to that, right?
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:35.160]   Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy
[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:37.080]   and the fact that when there is something,
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:38.600]   there is not nothing, right?
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:40.800]   And where there is something, there can be awareness,
[02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:44.240]   there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right?
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:48.820]   Is it that what's really going on is not about justice?
[02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:52.760]   Yes, we have free will, but it's that goodness,
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:56.400]   creating, shoring up, making better,
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:01.400]   that is the meaning, that is the good, right?
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:04.320]   And that the evil is the destruction
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:07.240]   as evidenced by the fact that it's overdetermined
[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:09.780]   probably a million times that we're in this eddy current
[02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:13.280]   of counter entropy and we could destroy that quite readily,
[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:15.400]   right, and then we're nothingness,
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:19.060]   like everything else that we know of that's not us,
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.180]   that doesn't have the ability to do something
[02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:23.900]   that's creative or constructive.
[02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:27.220]   I mean, I think that that's the answer
[02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:29.820]   and I think that our science really tells us
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:30.780]   that that's the answer.
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:33.100]   And I think it beckons us with ideas,
[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:36.620]   like we know that things happen outside of space and time,
[02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:38.260]   right, I mean, they're physics experiments, right?
[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:40.700]   Like we know this from the science of it,
[02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:43.840]   yet we don't stop and look and say, wait, is that?
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:45.500]   The magic of the idea, Einstein said,
[02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:47.660]   God doesn't play dice with the universe.
[02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:51.980]   I think, okay, maybe God doesn't play dice with the universe,
[02:53:51.980 --> 02:53:54.120]   that quantum indeterminacy and all of that
[02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:56.580]   is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak,
[02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:59.960]   but maybe it's in that indeterminacy
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:03.680]   that we're given the opportunity to assert ourselves,
[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:06.180]   right, to make something one way or another.
[02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:08.800]   You know, maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe,
[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:11.500]   but it's God loading the dice in our favor
[02:54:11.500 --> 02:54:14.220]   if we'll only listen to truth,
[02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:15.820]   the truth that being destructive
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:17.280]   doesn't help pursue anything,
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.740]   even in the person who thinks it will for themselves
[02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:22.060]   and that creativity and generativeness
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:24.540]   and kindness and compassion, like this is,
[02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:26.220]   doesn't that seem sort of analogous
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:27.920]   to the eddy current of counter-entropy
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:29.940]   that has us here in the first place?
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:32.520]   And I think that's where I pin meaning
[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:35.100]   and that meaning then, going back to the initial question,
[02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:38.860]   right, is generated in us through emotion,
[02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:40.820]   through what we feel that leads us to feel something
[02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:43.660]   that is mysterious, I don't know why I feel it.
[02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:46.460]   - Yeah, in some sense, emotion is kind of the fuel
[02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:48.960]   of that creative imperative we have.
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:52.880]   But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit,
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:54.740]   it does seem that the destruction,
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:55.980]   the creation and the destruction
[02:54:55.980 --> 02:54:58.700]   are the yin and yang of life,
[02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:03.460]   that it all works only if the main engine
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:05.060]   is towards creativity,
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:10.060]   but destruction also makes way for new things.
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:13.780]   So that's the, this kind of struggle,
[02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:15.740]   it seems like life is struggle
[02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:16.820]   between the different forces
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:18.460]   that make up the individual human,
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:20.940]   that make up society, all these tensions
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:24.220]   are necessary for growth, for development,
[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:28.280]   this kind of inner conflict and outer conflict
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:30.000]   are necessary for growth.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.140]   It's not just, I mean, in some sense,
[02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:34.480]   it's from the logic aspect,
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:37.940]   you kind of want everything to be perfect and just,
[02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.180]   for nobody to suffer, for everything to be perfect,
[02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:42.020]   but just like we talked about with trauma,
[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:45.420]   it just seems like it's such a big, giant mess.
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:46.940]   What is it, Bukowski said,
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:48.940]   find what you love and let it kill you.
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:52.180]   There's some aspect of,
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:55.220]   the negative aspect of passion and pursuit and obsession
[02:55:55.220 --> 02:56:00.220]   and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness,
[02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:05.220]   of the creative pursuits and all of that,
[02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:07.860]   I mean, that's part of life as well.
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:10.500]   That's, and I don't know what to do with that
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:13.700]   from an individual perspective
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:16.620]   in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life?
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.260]   How do you live a healthy life?
[02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:21.220]   'Cause it does seem that a bit of hardship
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:22.740]   or sometimes a lot of hardship
[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:25.940]   can make a pretty interesting life.
[02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:28.380]   I think it brings us back to the discussion
[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.620]   that we were having sort of before about like,
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:32.700]   what does it mean, like the challenges of trauma, right?
[02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:34.780]   And of overcoming, and I think here,
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:36.820]   we gotta be careful with the language, right?
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:40.780]   Because I would then say, let's take destruction, right,
[02:56:40.780 --> 02:56:43.300]   and separate it into two things, right?
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:47.100]   Like one is, you say destruction is like the breaking down,
[02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:48.940]   the tearing down of something, right,
[02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:53.660]   versus a process that has malice in it, right?
[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.980]   So just like when we were talking about trauma
[02:56:56.980 --> 02:56:59.900]   and setbacks, things to overcome,
[02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:00.980]   and we'd say, okay, if you say,
[02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:03.020]   hey, you have it harder than the next person
[02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:04.980]   and you have more to overcome,
[02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:07.020]   or someone put a barrier in front of you
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:08.660]   for you to overcome,
[02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.380]   that there can be a lot of growth in that,
[02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:11.900]   including the times when you don't know,
[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:14.940]   if you, gosh, can I do this, right, can I get over it, right?
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:17.900]   We're saying like that's challenge
[02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:19.980]   and something to overcome that's very positive,
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:21.660]   but we're saying, but there's no benefit
[02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:24.220]   of like throwing a racial slur in there, right?
[02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:25.940]   We're saying, because that's all bad,
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:27.540]   like that's not, even if the person says,
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:29.220]   I'm angry about that and I'm gonna overcome that,
[02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:30.180]   it's like, that didn't need to be,
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:31.700]   that didn't make anything better.
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:33.260]   If the person sees that and says,
[02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:37.580]   I'm gonna overcome that, it makes things less worse, right?
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:40.500]   Right, but there's no good to something
[02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:42.260]   that's created as destructive.
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:45.220]   We may look at forest fires, like, look, controlled burns.
[02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:46.820]   You say, there's a forest burning down,
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:48.660]   but that's, okay, there's some,
[02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:50.260]   there's some weakening, destruction there,
[02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:51.700]   there's a tearing down there,
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:53.700]   but it's in the service of the next fire
[02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:55.180]   not running through the community,
[02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:57.120]   you know, the town that's on the other side of it.
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:59.340]   That's very different than a forest fire,
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:01.300]   say, started by arson, right?
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:03.020]   So you might say, they're both a tearing down,
[02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:04.780]   they're a tearing down of the forest,
[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:06.860]   but one is in the service of goodness,
[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:09.260]   even though it's hurting the animals and the plants,
[02:58:09.260 --> 02:58:10.540]   it's not all good, right?
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:12.660]   But it's in the service of something
[02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:15.420]   as opposed to something else that's wantonly destructive.
[02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:17.580]   I think there's no good to the racial slur,
[02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:19.740]   there's no good to the arson, right?
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:22.020]   That's destruction in a way that's incorporating,
[02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:24.020]   I think, the malice of envy,
[02:58:24.020 --> 02:58:26.500]   the, you know, something that's really purely,
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:30.020]   if there's a yin and yang, that's the destructive,
[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:31.260]   that's the badness end.
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:36.060]   - So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing.
[02:58:36.060 --> 02:58:39.860]   And so, I mean, the reason I bring that up is like,
[02:58:39.860 --> 02:58:42.380]   all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship,
[02:58:42.380 --> 02:58:46.260]   like, what good does allowing racial slurs
[02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:49.300]   in public communication do, right?
[02:58:49.300 --> 02:58:52.100]   And it's like, our communication would surely be better
[02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:54.140]   if we don't say bad things to each other.
[02:58:54.140 --> 02:58:58.480]   But it's like, it seems like the truth is,
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:58:59.960]   our communication will be better
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:02.020]   if the amount of bad things
[02:59:02.020 --> 02:59:04.960]   is a small fraction of communication.
[02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:06.740]   That seems to be more true.
[02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:09.820]   Because another aspect of human nature with power,
[02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:13.580]   the moment you start censoring and removing bad words
[02:59:13.580 --> 02:59:15.940]   that everyone agrees are bad words,
[02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:19.180]   then the people at the top, they're doing the censoring,
[02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:20.620]   start getting greedy.
[02:59:20.620 --> 02:59:22.300]   It starts expanding.
[02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:25.340]   And this is the giant mess of human civilization
[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:28.380]   where we can't, the nice piles you created
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:29.720]   are kind of overlapping.
[02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:30.560]   (laughs)
[02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:32.000]   - I-- - It's a gray area.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:33.720]   - Yeah, I agree. - That's the problem with it.
[02:59:33.720 --> 02:59:34.800]   - No, I agree completely.
[02:59:34.800 --> 02:59:37.720]   There's a control of language, there are slippery slopes.
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:40.760]   I think there's a very big problem there.
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:41.840]   So I agree.
[02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:44.760]   I think, again, split parsing out the language,
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:47.400]   I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs
[02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:49.000]   as if like, let's stop saying the words.
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:52.520]   I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right?
[02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:54.320]   Like, you know, the prejudices.
[02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:56.800]   If we could eliminate the prejudice behind it,
[02:59:56.800 --> 02:59:58.180]   you know, I was struck,
[02:59:58.180 --> 03:00:00.800]   it said I do almost nothing about medicine.
[03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:04.040]   I get to medical school and start with anatomy, right?
[03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:07.600]   And it's remarkable as, you know, to see,
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:09.640]   as the bodies are being dissected,
[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:11.300]   that like, we're all humans.
[03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:13.840]   Like, it doesn't matter,
[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:15.840]   any of these things on the outside,
[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:18.880]   and that's true, not just like in our bodies,
[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:21.840]   but in our minds, part of the person that's not there,
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:24.000]   right, because now we're trying to learn from the body.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:27.640]   And, you know, it shows how ridiculous it is
[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:30.160]   if you think that we're 99 point how many nines,
[03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:32.080]   you know, percent all alike genetically.
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:34.360]   And by the way, it's only like take another 10th off
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:36.360]   and we're all orangutans, right?
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:40.740]   But somehow, we have to see these differences between us,
[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:42.760]   right, and where does that come from?
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:46.120]   And I think that, I believe that all comes from envy
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:49.320]   in that classical sense, that if I don't feel good enough,
[03:00:49.320 --> 03:00:52.000]   I'm gonna want someone to feel better about.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.160]   And sure, there can be visual things
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:56.760]   that that person looks different, right?
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:59.360]   Or you think about the, you know,
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.280]   I spent some time in Great Britain,
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:03.720]   and when there's a lot of conflict
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:05.560]   between Northern Ireland and Ireland, right?
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:06.960]   And you thought, wow, there's not,
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:08.560]   there's not even a look difference, right?
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.640]   It's the same general religious umbrella,
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:12.720]   same ethnicity, right?
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:14.560]   But now there's some religious difference.
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:17.160]   And I thought, it's not me trying to be denigrating,
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:18.640]   you know, around the Irish conflicts,
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:21.760]   like that's human of, oh, there's no actual difference
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:23.920]   between us, if I don't feel good about myself,
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:25.680]   I'm gonna find one, right?
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:30.240]   It's that, that I believe could go away.
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:33.040]   It's driven by maybe the trauma of just being alive
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:34.760]   in the world and things can happen to us.
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:38.700]   But we certainly promote in the human created trauma,
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:41.360]   people feeling not good enough, finding differences,
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:43.240]   there's a place for the envy to attach,
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:46.500]   and we're off to the races of, you know, wars.
[03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:48.040]   I mean, we're talking about the Second World War,
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:50.280]   and we think, well, what have we learned since then?
[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:53.080]   It'll take us a day to map out all the wars since then,
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:55.280]   right, let alone, for goodness sakes,
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:57.240]   everything that's salient right now.
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:01:59.760]   So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:03.260]   from what seem to be some very salient lessons.
[03:02:03.260 --> 03:02:08.360]   - I should mention one thing is that I also know
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:11.600]   that you're interested in Russian culture a little bit.
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:12.440]   - Yes.
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:15.720]   - Churchill said, "I cannot forecast to you
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:17.720]   "the action of Russia.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:19.420]   "It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery
[03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:20.640]   "inside an enigma."
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:23.800]   So what to you are some interesting differences
[03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:28.800]   between this eastern part of the world of Russia,
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:32.040]   Ukraine, the Slavic countries, the former Soviet Union,
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:35.080]   all of that versus sort of the US culture?
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:37.120]   What stands out to you from the literature,
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:40.980]   from the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff?
[03:02:40.980 --> 03:02:44.880]   - I think there's so much intensity,
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:49.460]   intensity and I guess I would say fearlessness
[03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:54.460]   of expression that I see in a Slavic culture.
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:59.420]   Maybe it's across cultures 'cause there's a different way
[03:02:59.420 --> 03:03:00.420]   that expression occurs.
[03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:02.980]   We say like, oh, it's different in the French
[03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:05.660]   than the Spanish or it's different than in parts of Africa.
[03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:08.280]   And I think when you take that part of the world
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:10.860]   for whatever reason and maybe it's just totally random
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:14.100]   or maybe it's aspects of geography and experience
[03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:16.980]   and migration, but there's such an intensity.
[03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:21.340]   And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on,
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:22.620]   maybe not for the very first time,
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:25.100]   but early on in my life, or reading Dostoyevsky
[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:29.980]   and feeling like, oh, Dostoyevsky's willingness,
[03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:33.860]   his ability and his willingness to express
[03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:38.220]   and create such powerful aberrant states
[03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:40.020]   of human experience.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:43.320]   Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:47.060]   that it expresses has always stood out to me
[03:03:47.060 --> 03:03:52.020]   as a way that if that's the brightest light,
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:54.020]   so to speak, communicating information,
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:56.140]   that that's a place to look.
[03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:59.780]   And it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:03.420]   because I think for some people who are informative years
[03:04:03.420 --> 03:04:05.780]   and having very difficult feelings, right,
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:07.860]   of like a depth of feeling of fear
[03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:09.500]   and how's the world gonna be?
[03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:10.860]   Am I gonna be annihilated?
[03:04:10.860 --> 03:04:11.900]   What do I even want?
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:13.720]   What do I feel inside of me?
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:18.220]   To encounter that being expressed so intensely,
[03:04:18.220 --> 03:04:21.160]   I found to be very, very moving.
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:22.800]   So I don't know if that's a good answer or not,
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:24.900]   but I think there's an intensity of expression
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:26.180]   and a fearlessness.
[03:04:26.180 --> 03:04:28.780]   Dostoyevsky wrote about terrible things.
[03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:30.780]   What happens in the person?
[03:04:30.780 --> 03:04:34.300]   Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually
[03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:39.180]   and very persuasive and very capable of being effective
[03:04:39.180 --> 03:04:42.820]   who also just chooses to be a child rapist, right?
[03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:44.300]   I mean, he wrote about that.
[03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:48.220]   He wrote about the truth of this is what we can be
[03:04:48.220 --> 03:04:50.860]   as humans, and I think there's so many lessons,
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:52.420]   including the truth.
[03:04:52.420 --> 03:04:54.740]   Like people will tend to think, oh, evil's not very bright
[03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:56.280]   or not very intelligent.
[03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:58.680]   That's a way to let evil propagate, right?
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:03.680]   Evil can be effective and attractive and very compelling,
[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:05.460]   but evil nonetheless.
[03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:08.200]   And I just think there's a fearless willingness
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:10.180]   to look at that and to describe it
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:14.180]   that I see primarily I've studied in Russian culture.
[03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:16.060]   - Yeah, the fearless exploration
[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:18.780]   of this whole human drama.
[03:05:18.780 --> 03:05:21.460]   Definitely Dostoyevsky and others since in the 20th century
[03:05:21.460 --> 03:05:24.340]   and the 19th century have done an incredible job of that.
[03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:25.500]   Some of that, just like you said,
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:27.260]   is the language, the culture.
[03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:30.400]   I think that intense romanticism is there.
[03:05:30.400 --> 03:05:35.400]   That is almost an overdramatic exploration of human nature.
[03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:41.440]   It can err on the side or falter
[03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:45.400]   when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life.
[03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:47.360]   You know, life is suffering.
[03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:49.800]   I think that also has to do with the way you deal
[03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:52.800]   with the trauma of the world wars and so on.
[03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:55.040]   This is something the different nations throughout Europe
[03:05:55.040 --> 03:05:57.120]   had to deal with that in different ways.
[03:05:57.120 --> 03:05:59.360]   Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment.
[03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:04.360]   Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism or cynicism.
[03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:09.620]   And ultimately the intensity of feeling is there,
[03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:12.460]   which is sort of interesting to see
[03:06:12.460 --> 03:06:14.100]   and interesting how that manifests itself
[03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:18.660]   in the kind of governments it builds up.
[03:06:18.660 --> 03:06:22.660]   You know, there's more authoritarianism
[03:06:22.660 --> 03:06:25.900]   in that part of the world versus the Western world
[03:06:25.900 --> 03:06:29.180]   that's more focused on the individual versus the collective.
[03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:31.100]   And when more focused on the individual,
[03:06:31.100 --> 03:06:34.140]   you have a propensity to value individual rights
[03:06:34.140 --> 03:06:35.640]   with democracy and so on.
[03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:37.220]   It's interesting to watch and yeah,
[03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:40.020]   to reconstruct how that all came to be.
[03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:42.840]   Is it in the blood?
[03:06:42.840 --> 03:06:44.480]   Is it in the mind?
[03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:48.000]   Is it in some kind of thing that more ethereal,
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:49.680]   a collective set of ideas that we pass
[03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:52.680]   from generation to generation between each other,
[03:06:52.680 --> 03:06:54.880]   sort of the collective of it?
[03:06:54.880 --> 03:06:57.660]   Yeah, it's fascinating to see.
[03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:00.600]   But now reinvigorated because there's conflict
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:01.900]   in that part of the world.
[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:06.020]   You've also thought about the Cold War.
[03:07:06.020 --> 03:07:09.060]   What lessons about the human mind,
[03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:10.800]   about psychiatry, psychology,
[03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:14.220]   and about looking at the Cold War
[03:07:14.220 --> 03:07:18.120]   can we take forward in the 21st century
[03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:21.580]   so that we can avoid World War III?
[03:07:21.580 --> 03:07:22.420]   - Right.
[03:07:22.420 --> 03:07:26.900]   - A major cold or hot war in the 21st century.
[03:07:26.900 --> 03:07:27.780]   - Yeah.
[03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:29.580]   Well, I think unspoken animosities
[03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:32.380]   are very, very, very dangerous.
[03:07:32.380 --> 03:07:34.520]   I mean, it was a cold war.
[03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:38.280]   There was fighting through proxies.
[03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.840]   The superpowers were fighting surrogate wars
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:43.480]   through proxies, which of course,
[03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:46.080]   in and of itself causes immense suffering.
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:51.080]   But it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:53.000]   or an exchange of thought.
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.060]   You know, I mean, even Khrushchev, right?
[03:07:55.060 --> 03:07:57.720]   Not believing that the kitchen could look like it did
[03:07:57.720 --> 03:07:58.960]   at the World's Fair, right?
[03:07:58.960 --> 03:08:02.080]   And some of the misconceptions here
[03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:04.520]   of what things were like in Russia, right?
[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:06.600]   It was an utter, it was a thought
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:09.640]   that those other people are not actually people, right?
[03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:12.360]   There's an enemy society of evil,
[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:14.640]   which then paints with a broad brush
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:18.000]   in a way that makes it easy, too easy for the Cold War,
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.320]   the war to go from being cold, right,
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:23.640]   to having boiling over into utter destruction.
[03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:27.200]   And I wrote, it was really a true story
[03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:31.480]   that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union,
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:32.560]   but it was right around the time
[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:34.840]   of the Soviet Union coming to an end,
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:39.840]   and I had gone on a trip for students from England,
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:42.440]   and we got to go places that people hadn't gone.
[03:08:42.440 --> 03:08:45.680]   You know, foreigners hadn't gone in many, many years.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:48.760]   It was just kind of the right timing to experience that.
[03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:52.720]   And it really is true that someone said on short notice
[03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:57.040]   to these poor kids that these group of Americans were coming
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.520]   and I have a picture somewhere of the kid in a gas mask.
[03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:03.480]   Like, as they went under their desks and put on gas masks,
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:07.320]   and they thought, right, that's what, I mean, that's what,
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:09.600]   they're taught to think about us
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:11.480]   and we're taught to think about them.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:15.560]   And like, now we're back in an us/them, right?
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:18.360]   When, you know, we're all trying to survive
[03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:23.360]   and we're all such, human life is so delicate, right?
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:27.240]   You know, let alone human happiness.
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:30.500]   And we make these divisions and we create this aggression
[03:09:30.500 --> 03:09:31.560]   and latent aggression.
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:33.200]   We do the Cold War, we developed, right,
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:35.380]   the ability to destroy the Earth, right?
[03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:37.680]   And then just sat looking at one another, you know,
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:40.320]   with further growing misunderstanding
[03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:42.720]   and the opportunity for the proxy fights,
[03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:44.840]   like when they said the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:47.000]   which I know wasn't a war, but it's an aspect of that,
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:50.600]   right, where we just have ourselves wildly, you know,
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:54.640]   at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding.
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:57.600]   And again, I would argue that that is the opposite
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:59.440]   of the counter-entropy, right?
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:01.440]   Like we are setting everything up for less,
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:03.120]   lack of communication, lack of understanding.
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:07.920]   How do those feelings of love and shared humanness happen?
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:08.800]   They don't, right?
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:11.680]   If you separate people and then we push ourselves
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:15.080]   more and more and more towards reinstating
[03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:16.600]   the state of entropy that's present
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:18.000]   in the rest of the universe.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.360]   - What advice would you give to young people
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:25.760]   that are fighting entropy with all their might?
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:30.600]   So young people and people that are wondering
[03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:32.640]   how to find their way in life,
[03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:35.880]   what advice would you give how to have a career,
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:38.240]   how to have a life they can be proud of?
[03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:43.840]   - I think starting off with sort of first principles.
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:46.200]   Okay, what are my values, right?
[03:10:46.200 --> 03:10:47.480]   How do I want to live life?
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:49.760]   Because, you know, I'm in my early 50s
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:52.280]   and when I was a kid, you know, we waited for the,
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:54.800]   the newspaper came in the afternoon and then, you know,
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:55.880]   and then we'd see something,
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.040]   okay, what's going on in the world?
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:57.880]   We'd learn something.
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:00.480]   I'd get the West Coast baseball scores, right?
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:02.600]   And learn about, oh, here's what happened
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:04.240]   in different parts of the world.
[03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:06.920]   And by and large, I and everyone else there,
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:10.960]   adult or child, were like living in a reality
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:13.000]   that was largely, our conception was largely
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:14.960]   what was around us, right?
[03:11:14.960 --> 03:11:17.360]   And now, in many ways, it is,
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:19.120]   I'm not saying it's entirely negative, of course,
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:20.120]   that we have more information,
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:22.720]   we can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.400]   But the other side of that is so much
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:29.560]   of the world's problems are on us all the time, right?
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:31.360]   Like, here's this awful thing that happened.
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:33.000]   How many awful things happen each day
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:34.720]   and they're right in front of us
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:37.720]   and there's such an immediacy to it all
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:40.240]   that I think it can be, it can like paralyze us
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:41.600]   with terror, right?
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:44.920]   And for someone who's young and trying to make their way,
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:46.840]   it's like, how do you figure your way out in this world
[03:11:46.840 --> 03:11:49.160]   that you're worried isn't even gonna exist, right?
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:51.280]   And then you see how profligate
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:54.320]   the generations before you are, right?
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:57.360]   In so many ways, and there can become,
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:11:58.880]   I think, a push towards extremes,
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:03.360]   either nihilism or I'm gonna change everything, right?
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:05.680]   And it's like, how about, let's start from
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:08.560]   how do I wanna behave in my own community, right?
[03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:09.400]   Which starts with like,
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:11.160]   how do I wanna behave in my household, right?
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:12.360]   What kind of neighbor do I wanna be?
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:13.960]   I mean, it might seem like things like that
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:17.380]   are silly or small in comparison to the big things,
[03:12:17.380 --> 03:12:18.580]   but I don't think they are.
[03:12:18.580 --> 03:12:22.040]   I think that's how we start building foundations
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:24.600]   that lets us tackle the big things.
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:27.240]   And I do find myself saying when I'm working with,
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:29.560]   sometimes doing therapy with younger people,
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:33.820]   of helping them kind of bring back their thoughts,
[03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:37.200]   their strivings, their decisions more to themselves
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:40.400]   and living with and around themselves more
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:44.520]   instead of in something that becomes very theoretical
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:48.520]   and therefore very threatening and unnerving.
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:50.120]   So focusing on the people around them,
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:52.360]   taking one small step at a time
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:56.800]   to form deeper connections to build something locally.
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:12:57.920]   - Yeah, how do I wanna be today?
[03:12:57.920 --> 03:12:59.520]   If I go into the grocery store
[03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:01.640]   and the person in front of me drops something,
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:04.560]   you know, I can scowl 'cause I'm in a rush, right?
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:06.440]   And I can be like that, right?
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:07.280]   I can be like that.
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:09.160]   I've been that way many, many times in my life, right?
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:11.320]   And it's never done anyone a damn bit of good,
[03:13:11.320 --> 03:13:12.560]   including me, right?
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:13.800]   Or I can realize like,
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:15.080]   the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter.
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:17.400]   Can I help pick that thing up or just smile?
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:19.480]   These are the seemingly small things
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:22.560]   that I think make the tenor of our lives.
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:25.720]   - Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline,
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:30.720]   one of the, really the main reason I moved to Austin, Texas,
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:34.240]   I just remember deciding it when I went to Walmart
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:39.240]   and a lady said, "You look handsome in that tie
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:42.000]   "or in that suit and tie," whatever.
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:43.680]   Like I don't think anyone's ever,
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:45.280]   it's an older lady, she was very sweet,
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:46.240]   there's kindness in her eyes.
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:47.840]   She said that, I don't think anyone ever said
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:51.200]   anything like that to me in my entire life.
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:54.800]   And it was just, I don't know, it was like,
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:56.440]   wow, there's kindness in this world.
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:58.240]   I know it sounds ridiculous, but like--
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:13:59.080]   - Does not sound ridiculous to me.
[03:13:59.080 --> 03:14:02.240]   - It's like those, you could be that for somebody.
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:04.320]   You go walk around in Walmart.
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:06.520]   - Right, the thing that you remember that,
[03:14:06.520 --> 03:14:09.200]   and it's pivotal, you're citing it as,
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:11.280]   hey, that was a big part of me moving here.
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:13.420]   So the thing with the branch point in your life
[03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:15.860]   that comes from the simple kindness, right,
[03:14:15.860 --> 03:14:18.520]   of a person who had goodness to give, right,
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:21.840]   and wasn't scared that you're gonna be upset by it.
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.720]   - Took the risk. - Right, right.
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:26.480]   She probably didn't have the thought
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:28.280]   that you could be assailing, right?
[03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:30.320]   Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give,
[03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:31.280]   it's simple to give it.
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:34.540]   It's that simple and it's beautiful
[03:14:34.540 --> 03:14:35.960]   and it's worth more to you than like
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:38.280]   how many studies would be on where's the right to live
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:39.120]   or this and that.
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:39.940]   None of that matters.
[03:14:39.940 --> 03:14:40.780]   What mattered was-- - It was just that.
[03:14:40.780 --> 03:14:42.320]   - Her freedom to be kind.
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:43.560]   - And that's emotion.
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:45.080]   That's not logic at all.
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:46.560]   - Right. (laughs)
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:48.160]   - That's purely just human emotion
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:49.800]   and a little bit of humanness,
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:51.960]   that little bit of connection.
[03:14:51.960 --> 03:14:55.000]   And then that's what makes life great.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.660]   - Which is why it's not a bad idea, right,
[03:14:56.660 --> 03:14:59.480]   that you moved here that way instead of,
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:02.220]   one could say, well, I can't believe you did that
[03:15:02.220 --> 03:15:03.520]   instead of looking at all the data
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:05.760]   and hiring consultants of what's the best place to live.
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:07.160]   But that would be wrong, right?
[03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:09.520]   Like you made a good decision, right?
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:11.040]   Like that was good data.
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:13.340]   It was impactful data, even in your thoughts
[03:15:13.340 --> 03:15:15.540]   about how you're happy living here, right?
[03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:17.260]   It's not that, oh, you discount,
[03:15:17.260 --> 03:15:21.020]   you shortchange yourself by not relying on all the logic.
[03:15:21.020 --> 03:15:22.580]   You felt something about the place
[03:15:22.580 --> 03:15:24.900]   and you felt it as symbolized in a person
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:26.700]   and that made the choice for you.
[03:15:26.700 --> 03:15:28.140]   - It's a balance, of course,
[03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:30.700]   but you also have to know yourself a little bit.
[03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:33.340]   Sometimes you can find stability and comfort
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:36.820]   in kind of reasoning things out a little bit.
[03:15:36.820 --> 03:15:41.380]   Maybe as people close to me have sometimes criticized
[03:15:41.380 --> 03:15:44.140]   and that I'm a little bit too romantic
[03:15:44.140 --> 03:15:46.580]   where I'll just follow the feeling.
[03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:50.300]   And life, there's physics,
[03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:52.220]   there's a reality to this world.
[03:15:52.220 --> 03:15:57.220]   And sometimes reality doesn't allow you to flourish
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:16:00.140]   if you just follow your feelings,
[03:16:00.140 --> 03:16:02.140]   but there's a dance there.
[03:16:02.140 --> 03:16:05.680]   And happiness is ultimately found in that landscape
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:10.680]   of feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.
[03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:12.900]   - As you said, have their place, right?
[03:16:12.900 --> 03:16:13.740]   - Everything, yeah.
[03:16:13.740 --> 03:16:14.580]   - They have their place.
[03:16:14.580 --> 03:16:15.400]   - They do, they do.
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:17.300]   - But they're not the be all and end all.
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:20.420]   - You're an incredible person.
[03:16:20.420 --> 03:16:22.540]   Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours.
[03:16:22.540 --> 03:16:24.580]   He said, "You absolutely must talk."
[03:16:24.580 --> 03:16:29.020]   Carl Dyseroth, the number of people you know,
[03:16:29.020 --> 03:16:30.300]   they're just incredible people.
[03:16:30.300 --> 03:16:32.760]   There's just this group of folks
[03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:35.940]   that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together.
[03:16:35.940 --> 03:16:38.420]   And I'm so happy you exist.
[03:16:38.420 --> 03:16:40.380]   I'm so happy you're doing the work you're doing.
[03:16:40.380 --> 03:16:42.060]   I can't wait for your second book.
[03:16:42.060 --> 03:16:42.900]   - Thank you.
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:44.060]   - And thank you for talking today.
[03:16:44.060 --> 03:16:45.220]   This was really cool.
[03:16:45.220 --> 03:16:46.040]   - Thank you so much.
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:50.320]   I'm proud to be among the group of people that you cited,
[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:51.220]   proud to be their friend,
[03:16:51.220 --> 03:16:52.860]   and proud that you've had me on today.
[03:16:52.860 --> 03:16:53.700]   Thank you so much.
[03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:55.060]   - Thank you, Paul.
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:57.580]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Conte.
[03:16:57.580 --> 03:16:58.700]   To support this podcast,

[03:17:01.640 --> 03:17:03.580]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:17:03.580 --> 03:17:04.900]   from Viktor Frankl.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:08.260]   "Everything can be taken from a man,
[03:17:08.260 --> 03:17:10.780]   but the last of the human freedoms,
[03:17:10.780 --> 03:17:14.500]   to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
[03:17:14.500 --> 03:17:16.540]   Thank you for listening,
[03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:18.500]   and hope to see you next time.
[03:17:18.500 --> 03:17:21.080]   (upbeat music)
[03:17:21.080 --> 03:17:23.660]   (upbeat music)
