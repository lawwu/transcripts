[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.320]   the epistle to the Romans, Paul's epistle to the Romans, chapter 15 and verse 4, the
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.920]   fourth verse in the fifteenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.760]   "For whatsoever things were written afore time were written for our learning, that we
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.640]   through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.440]   For whatsoever things were written afore time were written for our learning, that we through
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.640]   patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.000]   Now those are typical and representative words out of this great book which we call the Bible
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.800]   and those are the words that this book addresses to the world this evening.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.560]   Here we are in a world which is troubled, perplexed, confused, unhappy, discouraged
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.520]   and without hope.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.620]   That's no exaggeration is it?
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.300]   That is the state and the condition of the world at this present moment.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.080]   What men and women had so fondly believed for a number of years has been belied by facts.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.560]   The optimistic prophecies of the teachers that were held in greatest repute and respect
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.360]   have been shown to be almost entirely and completely false.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   For, as I'm never tired of reminding you, this century we have been told and told repeatedly
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.200]   and repeatedly was to be the greatest century that the world had ever known.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.480]   Civilization at last was beginning to flower and it but remained for us to pick the fruits
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   in this new paradise into which as the result of education and knowledge and science and
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.120]   learning and acts of Parliament and the whole growth and development of men, all these things
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.080]   were to introduce that paradise.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.320]   But as I say, we find ourselves in very different circumstances and all that men had so fondly
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.100]   hoped is being belied before their very eyes.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.720]   But in addition to that, all that men have tried to do, all the solutions to which they've
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.000]   turned, all the experiments which they've made, seem to turn to nothing but to failure.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.520]   I'm not here to criticize them, I'm simply reporting facts.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.360]   Men have made great efforts about this world, especially in the last hundred years.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   But what's happened to them?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   What's come of them?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.360]   We've tried the various expedients, but they do not seem to succeed.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   And the result of all this, as I say, is that the world tonight finds itself in this unhappy
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.520]   and miserable state and condition.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   What does it need then, at this moment, above everything else?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.680]   Well, I suggest to you that what the world needs above everything else is something like
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.200]   this.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   It needs understanding.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   It's bewildered.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.480]   It doesn't know why things are as they are.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.320]   It needs understanding.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.040]   It needs intellectual help.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   And then it needs comfort.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.440]   For the times are cruel and the world, I say, is unhappy.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.200]   There was never, perhaps, greater need of comfort.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.600]   And then it needs encouragement.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.720]   When you've tried and tried and tried again, only to fail repeatedly, the danger is to
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.080]   give up trying, and one becomes utterly discouraged.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.440]   Some perhaps even to the extent of becoming utterly cynical about it all.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.480]   So the world needs, at the same time, encouragement.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:23.120]   Well now, here is the very thing which is offered this very moment in this old book,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.480]   which we call the Bible.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.680]   Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.640]   Now, the Apostle Paul, in writing this, of course, was referring exclusively to the Old
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.080]   Testament Scriptures.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   The New Testament had not yet come into being.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   He's referring to what we call the Old Testament.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.840]   And that is what he says it does.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.320]   That is what it gives us.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.560]   That is its promise.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   And he says, "We know that this is true.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.280]   We've reaped the benefit and we have enjoyed it together."
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.880]   Now, he talks about patience, and that means the ability to go on, patient endurance, if
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.600]   you like, fortitude.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.480]   And so the Apostle says that these are the very things which are offered us by the Scriptures.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.640]   Well now then, my friend, here is something that we can apply to ourselves, and we can
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.840]   ask ourselves a question before we go any further.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.320]   Do you get that out of the Bible?
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.360]   Is that what this book is to you?
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.920]   Do you find that at this moment, in the world as it is, and with all the perplexities and
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.720]   the confusion, that here you find knowledge and instruction, you find comfort and consolation,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   you find encouragement and fortitude, you are given a hope?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.920]   Now, there is no value in our reading of the Bible if it doesn't lead to that.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.880]   The Bible is a book that is meant to help us in all these ways.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   Reading the Bible should never be a task.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.660]   What if it's a mere task to us?
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.280]   Something that we do by rota, by rule, something that we feel that we should do.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.840]   Well, and if that's all you get out of it, it's not the Word of God to you.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.120]   It isn't fulfilling its function according to the teaching of the Apostle.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   We should go to this book as a thirsty man goes to a fountain, as a hungry man goes to
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.720]   a larder, as a man who's absolutely in the dark, waits for a gleam of light.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.640]   That's the way to approach this book.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.400]   That's how it offers itself to us.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.660]   That is how it presents itself before us.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.600]   So I make no apology for asking this question.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.680]   Are you living by this book at the present time?
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.780]   Is this the thing that keeps you going?
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.600]   If it isn't, well, I am afraid you've never understood it.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.880]   You've somehow missed it.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.840]   If this isn't everything to you, if it doesn't give you all this which we need above everything
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.160]   at the present time, somewhere or another there is something wrong.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.240]   Well, now, it's quite clear that to large masses of people, indeed to the majority,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.720]   the book doesn't speak like that.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.640]   It doesn't do this very thing which it promises to do and offers to do.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   Why not?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.280]   Well, that's the matter that I want to deal with you this evening.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.680]   This is a tragedy to me that anybody having this book in a language that they can understand
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   and open before them and the absolute freedom to read it should nevertheless find nothing
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   in it.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.720]   And there are so many like that.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.400]   They don't want to listen to the Bible.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.960]   They want to read the newspaper article, the leading article or some special man writing
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.880]   some special, hoping that...
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   And you get nothing.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.760]   They're doing it Sunday after Sunday.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   They never get anything.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.280]   My dear friend, isn't it time you began to listen to this?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   This is practical.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.560]   This isn't some old book that ought to be on a library shelf.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.480]   This is a book that's in the midst of life.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.520]   Here is a book that doesn't look at things theoretically.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.200]   I say it deals with it on the practical level and it's offering us instruction, comfort,
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.040]   consolation, hope, the very thing that the world needs at this hour.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.000]   There is no more up-to-date book in the world at this minute than this old, old book which
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.720]   we call the Bible.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.440]   Well why is it that people don't find all this in it?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   What's the matter?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.760]   That's what I'm concerned about.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.280]   I'm trying to be practical.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.040]   I'm trying to be simple.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:42.640]   Well it seems to me that the answers to the question are something like this.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.440]   What do we got to do in order that the Bible may give us all this?
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.640]   Well there are certain things I think that are quite obvious.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   The first is that we must observe certain essential conditions as we come to read it.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.800]   There's no doubt that most of the trouble is there, always in this approach.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.120]   You see people get nothing from the Bible because they've already put themselves into
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.400]   a position which makes it impossible for them ever to get anything out of it.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.640]   If you approach any subject, I don't care what it is, with a biased mind, with a prejudiced
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   mind and that you go to it simply to find faults and errors, something to turn down,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.880]   well you'll probably end by just confirming what you thought and felt at the beginning.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.160]   Now that's true of almost anything.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.080]   Prejudices, we know the power of prejudices.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.840]   How they blind us, we are no longer open to truth, we become quite impervious.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.560]   We have decided that we are not going to find any good in something and therefore of course
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   we don't find it.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.800]   It's not surprising.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.960]   Now this is the tragedy with so many in their very approach to this great book which we
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.360]   call the Bible.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.520]   What then I say are these essential conditions which we must observe as we come to it?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.400]   Well the first is this, I've got to start with it.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.160]   We've got to believe that it is God's Word to us.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.600]   That's what it says itself, that is its own claim.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   None of the people who wrote here said that they were just writing their own opinions.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   You notice how the apostle refers to it.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:28.120]   He talks here that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures, the writings, the
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.800]   scriptures, that's what he calls them, that's what they're always called, that's what they
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   call themselves.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.000]   Now this is a very definite and special designation.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.080]   It doesn't say you've read in the various books that are bound together in one volume.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.800]   No, that isn't what he's...
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   The writings, the scriptures, they're put into a category apart.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   There's something unique.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.880]   Now the apostle's very concerned about that.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.640]   In the third chapter of this same epistle to these Romans he asks a question, "What
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.200]   advantage then hath the Jew or what profit is there of circumcision?"
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   He answers, "Much every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.120]   of God."
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.960]   The oracles of God.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   Now the people in the ancient world were always going to consult oracles.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.560]   Life, you see, has always been difficult.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.200]   People didn't know what to do.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.760]   A prince wouldn't know whether he was to make war or whether he was to make overtures for
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   peace.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.400]   A man wouldn't know whether he was to get married or not.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.320]   There were difficulties, there were problems, and people were unhappy.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.640]   And they said, "Well, we've thought it out, but we can't come to any decision.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   What can we do?"
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.400]   Ah, then they'd hear that there was an oracle in such and such a place, Delphi in Greece
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.520]   or somewhere like that.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.360]   And you went there and you went through certain ceremonial, and then you presented your question,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   and the oracle that was supposed to live there or to speak there through some priest or priestess
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.000]   or in some manner, the oracle would deliver a message.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.800]   And the ancient world was full of this kind of thing.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.700]   But the Jews didn't do that kind of thing.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.640]   They were a unique and a separate people.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   Why?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.200]   Well, as the apostle says, "Unto them had been given the oracles of God."
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.720]   That's another way of describing the scriptures, the Old Testament scriptures, the writings,
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.160]   the scriptures, the oracles of God, the Word of God.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.020]   Now this is something I say that we must realize at the very beginning.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.980]   This is not literature like any other literature.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.240]   You don't put this on your shelf by the side of Plato or Socrates or anybody else, any
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.520]   other oracular person.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.600]   Now here is an essential difference.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:58.160]   The claim that is made by all these writers is that it had been revealed to them.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.560]   They didn't sit down and try and work it out and think it out.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   They were not philosophers.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.160]   I'm not saying anything against philosophers.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.400]   I'm simply showing the difference, that's all.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Philosophers are all right.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.640]   Philosophy is a great subject.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.760]   It's right that men should think.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.720]   God forbid I should say a word against philosophy as such.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.360]   But the whole effort, but what I am saying is this, that these men tell us that their
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.640]   state and condition was very different.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.840]   What has happened to all these is this, that they were doing something else.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.480]   And suddenly they were disturbed.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.720]   God spoke to them.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.800]   Take a typical instance.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   Take a man like Moses.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.840]   He was a very clever man, a very learned man, had been brought up as the son of Pharaoh's
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.440]   daughter, a man in a great position, a man who'd been taught all the wisdom of Egypt
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.200]   in those days, and it was then at that time about the greatest wisdom in the whole world.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   Well, here he is, but you remember, owing to circumstances, he'd had to flee the country,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.240]   and there he is, a shepherd looking after sheep.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.560]   He wasn't sitting down working out a philosophy of life.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   He was tending sheep.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.800]   He'd married and he had settled down to that sort of life.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.240]   And one afternoon he was taking the sheep, as we are told, to the back side of the mountain.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.720]   And quite suddenly he saw a bush aflame with fire.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.400]   And he noticed it, though it was aflame, it wasn't being consumed.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.520]   And his attention being thus drawn, he went to examine it.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.800]   And a voice came and spoke to him and told him certain things.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.920]   Now, that's what they all say in effect.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.280]   It doesn't always happen like that.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.080]   It happens in different ways.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.440]   They say the burden of the Lord came to me.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.200]   And men will say that, like Amos, that he was a herdsman and so on.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.400]   But God spoke to him, gave him a message, said, "Go!"
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.640]   He'd not thought of doing anything, but a message came.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:52.520]   This is what they all claim, from beginning to end, both in the Old Testament and in the
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   New.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.920]   Now, my dear friend, don't you see the importance of realizing this?
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:06.320]   Here is something that makes this unique claim, that it is a word that is the result of revealed
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.440]   truth from God, not men striving and seeking and at last finding, but God drawing back
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:19.840]   a veil, revealing truth and enabling men to write it and record it under the control and
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.120]   the influence and the direction of his Holy Spirit.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   That's what they say.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.080]   Peter sums it all up in that well-known phrase.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   No prophecy of Scripture, he says, is of any private interpretation, by which he means
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.480]   no man has sat down and excogitated this thing from his own brain.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   No, no.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.600]   No prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:54.680]   But holy men of God speak as they were moved, carried along, borne along by the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.920]   Now then, here is something that is quite basic and fundamental.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.080]   In other words, you know, when you take up a Bible, you mustn't take it up as if you
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.200]   take up any other book.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.960]   I'm never sure you know that we ought even to read the Bible sitting down.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   I have a feeling that we always ought to read it either standing or kneeling, just to remind
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.400]   ourselves that it's different.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.600]   You don't pick up this book casually because it's a word from God.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.320]   It's come to us in that way.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.440]   That's one condition.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.040]   The second condition follows, of course, quite inevitably from it.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.840]   That we must come to it and therefore accept it and its authority.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.800]   Clearly, if it's a word from God, it's the only rational thing to do.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.960]   If this is a manifestation and a revelation of the mind of the eternal and absolute everlasting
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.640]   God, well, who am I with my pygmy little mind to pit myself against it?
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.280]   But that is what men do, isn't it?
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.840]   And that's where they find nothing in it.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   They're trying to understand.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.960]   But here I say we must come with an attitude which was commended to Moses at that burning
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   bush.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.280]   He was going to investigate, you remember.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.120]   The word comes, "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.800]   standest is holy ground."
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   And I think we should come like that to this book, "holy ground."
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.720]   And therefore, we must come to it in this kind of attitude and spirit of mind.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.600]   We must take it as it is.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.920]   If it is an oracle from God, if it is a message from God, well then, you take the whole message.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.720]   You don't pick out a bit here and another bit there and leave out bits here and bits
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   there.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   No, no.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.440]   If this is an oracle from God, well then, we've got to take it all.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   But you see, men and women are doing the exact opposite.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   "Ah," they say, "the sun on the mountain, yes, I like that, that's good teaching.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.960]   You're told there to turn the other cheek, I like that."
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.440]   But my dear friend, you don't decide what's right and what's true.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.840]   You either believe it all or you believe none of it.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   There's no alternative.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.480]   All the parts and portions hang together.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.560]   And if this is an oracle from God, then I say you must take it all.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   You must accept the whole.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.920]   I'm very concerned about this this evening.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.520]   I verily believe that if we all only realized the wholeness of the message of this book,
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.640]   it would make a very profound difference to our reading of it and to our understanding
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   of it.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.800]   You see, we keep on missing the wood because of the trees.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.360]   We get bogged down upon certain details.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.800]   Before you come to any detail, take the whole.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   Look right through from beginning to end.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.540]   See the unity, see the developing theme, see it as a whole.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.680]   Then you'll begin to understand the parts.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.880]   In other words, I say we must submit ourselves to it.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.560]   And shouldn't we all do so?
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.320]   Who are we to criticize when all our ideas have been disproved?
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.640]   When all our hopes have been dashed to the ground?
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.480]   When all our experiments have failed?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.120]   Who are we, who is this generation, to stand up in judgment on the word of God?
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.800]   It's failed on its own showing and where it claims to be most expert.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.360]   Isn't it time we became a little bit humble?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.880]   What hope is there for the world while men are so self-confident?
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.360]   While they're so assured?
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.040]   While they don't hesitate to sit in judgment upon God's oracle?
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   It's not surprising the world is as it is.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   But they say that's irrational to submit yourself like that.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.800]   My dear friend, it's the height of rationality and I prove it to you like this.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.200]   When you find yourself without understanding and utterly confused, and when you see that
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.080]   the greatest minds of men are unable to unravel the problem, I say the logical next step is
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   this.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:51.560]   Come and listen and submit to what claims to be an oracle from God himself.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   That's rationality.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.520]   That's just another way of putting in my own language once more what I'm so fond of quoting
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:07.920]   that yes, immortal remark of Blaise Pascal, "The supreme achievement of reason is to bring
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.420]   us to see that there is a limit to reason."
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:17.480]   And if you haven't come to see the limit of reason, God help you and your world.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.200]   But that's the trouble.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.560]   And the moment you come to see that there is a limit to reason, you submit and you are
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.200]   prepared to listen and to receive.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.320]   That's the approach.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.200]   And without that approach, there is no hope.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.440]   So it seems to me that when we come to this book, we must therefore not only come with
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.840]   a childlike simplicity, we must pray to have the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.920]   Men by nature can't receive this truth.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.520]   It's beyond him.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.840]   He thinks it's foolishness.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   That's because he is blind.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.560]   You wouldn't give a little child a great book on philosophy, would you?
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.000]   The child would say, "What's this rubbish?"
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.520]   The child thinks the only thing that's wonderful is pictures.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   He says, "There's no..."
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   You give him a book, he cries, he throws it away.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   He's not interested.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.480]   "This is not a book I like," he says.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   Of course he doesn't.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.800]   It's no reflection on the book, is it?
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.840]   But it tells us a great deal about the child's mind.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.920]   It can't take it in.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.960]   That's how we all are, face to face with God's truth.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.920]   So we not only become as little children, we should pray God to enlighten us by his
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.240]   Spirit, to give us understanding, that we may come to know something of the comfort
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.000]   and the consolation and the patience which are given by the Scriptures, that we may enjoy
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.360]   this as the saints of the centuries have enjoyed it.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   Do you know there's something wrong with a man who doesn't enjoy this?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   He's blind.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.880]   Have you ever realized that?
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Very well, that's the approach.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.880]   It's essential.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.800]   But come, let's go to a second point.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.120]   We must realize that the Bible has its own special way of conveying this comfort and
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.720]   consolation and encouragement.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   What is that?
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:01.080]   Here it is, "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.280]   we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope."
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.160]   How does the Bible help us?
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.040]   Well, let's be clear about the negative before I come to the positive.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   The Bible never gives comfort and consolation directly.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   What do you mean, Sir Simon?
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   Well, I mean this.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.160]   There are certain psychologists and others who tell people who can't sleep to read
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.080]   psalms at night and it'll help them to sleep.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   Soothing effect, beautiful literature.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.040]   That's an utter abuse of the Scriptures.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.960]   That's seeking some direct help from the Scriptures.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.120]   You might as well take a drug, hypnotic, soporific.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.720]   You might as well take as some do a glass of whiskey, if that's what you want.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.280]   If you just want some direct effect of the Scriptures, just to have a nice, comfortable
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.560]   feeling and to feel how wonderful it is and how beautiful and how glorious, how amazing
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:04.400]   is literature, if that's the comfort you get, you might as well not read your Bible
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   at all.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.660]   No, no, it doesn't do it directly.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.400]   How does it give comfort and consolation?
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.480]   Well, listen to what it says itself.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   It does so by teaching us.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.240]   "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning."
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.640]   Instruction.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.800]   This is the Bible method, and we must never forget this.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.120]   I believe there are masses outside the church tonight because they say, "Ah, but you people,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   you're just hopeless sentimentalists.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.720]   You spend your time singing your choruses and your carols and so on, and you make your
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.000]   sentimental statements.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.600]   I can't abide it.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.680]   Give me something for my mind, my understanding.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   I'm not a child.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.400]   I have absolute sympathy with such a person.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.000]   He's much nearer the Bible position than many of the others.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Our instruction.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.920]   This is a book of instruction, a book of knowledge.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   It's a book of acts.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.160]   It's a book of facts.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160]   It's a book of history.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   It's a book of teaching.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.560]   The Bible, my friend, addresses first and foremost the mind, the mind of man, God's
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:13.400]   greatest gift to man, written for our instruction, for our learning.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:19.720]   Now then, if therefore you want to get anything out of this, you must pay heed to the exhortation
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.160]   of the apostle Peter, "Gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.960]   Is anybody surprised at this?
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.280]   I think many are surprised today.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   They've got hold of this notion that it's just a little sentimental ditty, as it were,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.000]   and that Christians are people who just don't think.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.680]   I'm here to try to show you that they're the only people who do think, the only people
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.400]   who can think rationally.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.800]   All the others have failed.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.440]   Here and here alone do I find light and learning and instruction.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.360]   That's the way the Bible comforts me.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.800]   And if you are not comforted by the Bible via the instruction, well, you've got something
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   wrong.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   You've got something false.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.200]   If you've just got a nice feeling within you without understanding, you are not a Christian.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.840]   A Christian is a man who can give a reason for the hope that is in him, says the apostle
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   Peter again.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.560]   The comfort, the consolation, the hope, the encouragement, the fortitude, the everything
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.040]   are the result of the instruction, the knowledge, the information.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.160]   Thank God for this.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.520]   Let me show you.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.440]   That brings me to my third point.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.000]   What is this teaching, then, through which and by means of which the Bible gives me this
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.360]   comfort and consolation and blessed encouragement?
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   What is the teaching?
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   Now, I'm going to give you a bird's eye view of the teaching of the Bible.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.760]   I said just now that this is the best way to approach it all.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.800]   So I'm going to give you a broad picture, a broad outline.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.440]   Many people call this day Bible Sunday.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.640]   Very well, call it what you like.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.760]   I want to expound the message to you, as I try to do every Sunday.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.240]   And as I said this morning, I say again tonight it's no use talking about Bible Sunday if
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.280]   you don't believe the Bible is the Word of God.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.240]   It's no use talking about Bible Sunday if you put your reason and understanding above
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240]   this.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.080]   If you are looking down upon it from some Olympian height, you might as well throw the
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   book into the fire.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.280]   You've got to come down on your knees, I say.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.000]   Then it really is the Oracle of God, the Word of God, and you approach it in the Spirit,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.280]   the only Spirit that will enable you to understand it.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   What's the teaching?
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   Well, here it is.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.960]   It goes as follows.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.160]   The Bible gives us understanding about the world and its condition.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   Now this is, I argue, the first need and desire of every thinking person at this present time.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.800]   Don't you find that that's the most discouraging thing in the world, when you don't understand
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   what's happening?
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.880]   Now, we all do that, don't we, in ordinary life?
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.680]   How many patients tell their doctors, "Tell me what it tells."
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.360]   If I only knew what it was, it would give me great satisfaction.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   This year I'd be ready then to face anything.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.440]   But as wild as this uncertainty, I don't know where I am.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.760]   Please tell me what it tells.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.160]   Now there's great comfort always in knowing exactly what your trouble is, isn't there?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.640]   It's a good thing to have that knowledge.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.960]   Now that's how the Bible works.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.720]   The Bible doesn't just pat you on the back saying everything's going to be all right.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.080]   People say pie in the sky and so on.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   No, no.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:34.440]   The Bible instructs and it gives you knowledge and learning and information about this whole
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   question.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.560]   And I know of nothing so comforting at this hour in the world than the way in which the
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:46.040]   Bible enables me, yes, me, to understand why the world is as it is.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.920]   I make that claim.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.840]   I'm not baffled by the world condition this evening at all.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.240]   I'm not a bit surprised, not a bit.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.800]   It's the people who don't believe the Bible who are surprised.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.040]   Any man who knows his Bible far from being surprised by the state of the world tonight
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.440]   should say that the state of the world tonight proves to the absolute hilt everything the
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.400]   Bible has ever taught.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.160]   And what comfort that is and consolation.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.120]   It means, you see, that you're in touch with eternal truth and reality.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.720]   Well, now then, how does it do this?
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.960]   Well, it does it in this way.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.680]   Its whole approach is so utterly different from everything that is done by every other
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.360]   teaching, I don't care what it is.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:37.640]   The Bible approaches it all not by looking at men, not by looking at nations, not by
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:46.120]   looking at theories and attempts and ideas, no, no, by looking at God.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.520]   Nothing else in the world is doing this tonight but this teaching.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.860]   Everything else is looking at it from the human standpoint, from the level of men, watching
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.960]   these nations, piling up their arms, who's going to make the next move, what can we do?
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.800]   Men thinking, men reasoning, men trying to understand, making experiments, trying to
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   solve problems.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   Men, always men.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.920]   And that's what's so fatal.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.760]   The Bible starts in an utterly different manner.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.400]   The world, look at it, yes, but the first question to ask is, where's it come from?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.800]   What is this world?
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.080]   Is this just an accident?
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.960]   Is this just some odd conglomeration of accidents and chance and fortuity?
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   What is the universe?
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   What is man?
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   What's the whole thing?
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:43.120]   And there's only one answer in the world at this moment, "In the beginning, God."
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.600]   You know we're not in an accidental universe.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.640]   The Bible at the very beginning gives me all the comfort and the consolation I need in
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.680]   that first verse of the book of Genesis, "In the beginning, God."
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.480]   In other words, the Bible views the whole cosmos in terms of the almighty and everlasting
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.920]   God and his great purpose for the universe.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.000]   Now then, there's the key to it all.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.880]   So it goes on to say this, you see, that the world itself and life in this world are not
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.280]   accident, they're not chance.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.000]   You see, if you believe that, you're already hopeless.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.960]   If everything is because it is and we don't know how it started and how these gases suddenly
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.040]   became something else, well, if it's all vague, chaotic, indefinite, well, I'm already hopeless.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.120]   If I'm in such a universe, I don't know where I am, but here's something that tells me God,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.720]   the everlasting, made, created, said, "Let there be light," and there was light, and
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.640]   went on with creation, set things going.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.560]   He's got a grand purpose, he brought it all into being for a purpose.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.880]   At once, I say, "Well, I don't understand, but I've got some confidence.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.680]   If I don't, God does!"
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.000]   And I am at once finding a certain amount of rest and peace and comfort and encouragement.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.040]   And then you come to men himself.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   What is men?
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.880]   Well, you know, according to modern scientific teaching, and now I'm quoting, I'm not even
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   putting it in my own words, I'm quoting directly.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:25.720]   Men, we are told, is an accidental and quite likely a passing product of nature.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:33.080]   That's what you are.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   An accidental and quite likely a passing product of nature.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   What's nature?
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   Force.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   Brute force.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:56.280]   Unintelligent force, power, energy, nothing controlling it at all, it just blunders along.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:02.440]   And in its blundering it throws up this, and then throws it away, and makes something better,
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.040]   and then throws that something better away and makes something better.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.280]   And at last it threw up men.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   But it doesn't stop at that.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:16.240]   If this is an evolving process which is going on in terms of this undirected brute force
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.480]   and energy, it may throw men away onto the scrap heap and go on and produce something
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   else.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   Why not?
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.160]   That's to be logical if you take the scientific view of the universe and reject this biblical
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.480]   view of God as the creator of the whole universe and of man.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   No, no.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.000]   That isn't it.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   And if I thought it was that, I'd be of all men most hopeless tonight.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.120]   I'd have no comfort and consolation.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.440]   You don't know what's going to happen next.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.240]   But this is the teaching.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.400]   This is the teaching of some of your most famous modern scientists.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.860]   I could name them, I don't want to do that.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.160]   But you can read their books, you can read their articles, you can listen to them very
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.760]   often on the wireless, and you will find that they say as they must say, that they see no
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:07.040]   object, no purpose, no end, no teleological principle as they call it, use their jargon,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.460]   in the whole universe.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.460]   Anything may happen, they say.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.840]   They wouldn't like to prophesy or predict anything.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.000]   They have no hopes that man will suddenly become sensible.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.080]   They are doing their best to make him become sensible, they say, but they've got no confidence.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.080]   They don't know what may happen.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.480]   This elemental force, you never know what it's going to do next.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   And you're utterly disconsolate.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   You're without hope.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   There's no comfort.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   There's no consolation.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.800]   All you can hope is that it'll happen to keep going as long as you are here, and that you're
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.140]   not cast under the scrap heap of evolution.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.520]   But that's complete hopelessness.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.380]   That's despair.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.240]   That's the complete negation of hope.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:48.080]   But you see, the Bible comes and tells me that man isn't just an accident throwout,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.080]   accidental throwout.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.420]   Man, what is he?
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.340]   As I face this universe and see men behaving as they do, and as I see myself and know the
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.800]   contradictions within myself, I say, is this all madness?
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.160]   Is man just a fool?
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.760]   Is man just the meeting place of a number of accidents, as one of your greatest philosophers
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   today teaches?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.160]   That's his view of man.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.440]   Man is just the meeting place of a number of accidental happenings, he says.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   And it'll all disintegrate.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   No, no.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.240]   Man is made in the image of God.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.400]   He here, I believe, in the integrity of his personality on the basis of this scriptural
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.400]   teaching.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.320]   I believe he's a responsible being.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.840]   I believe he's responsible to God.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.640]   He's meant for something bigger and better.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.480]   He was never meant to be like this.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.440]   Very well, that brings me to my next question.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.680]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.840]   Well, outside the Bible there's no explanation.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.560]   It's all meaningless, all accident.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.640]   Anything can happen.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   Never know when it will happen.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.040]   You've no hope for anything better.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.600]   And that doesn't satisfy us.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.240]   We've all got a feeling that the world wasn't meant to be like this, haven't we?
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.720]   There is a feeling innate in human nature that man was meant for better things.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   That there's something wrong with the world, radically wrong.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   But what's the answer?
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   What's the explanation?
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.160]   I want knowledge.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.320]   I want to be comforted.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.760]   I want to know first why are things as they are?
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.200]   What's the matter with this patient?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.560]   And the Bible alone has got an answer for me, and it's this.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.200]   That this being called man whom God made in his own image and whom he endowed with reason
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:32.040]   and a soul and these extraordinary faculties, that this man deliberately rebelled against
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   God, set up himself as an autonomous being, asserted his own will, his own reason, and
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:44.000]   his own understanding, and thereby alienated himself from God and fell and became the victim
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.920]   of his own lower nature and of powers and forces greater than himself outside him called
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.480]   the devil and all the forces of evil and of hell.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:00.200]   And that because of all this, he is under the wrath of God.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.000]   That's what the Bible tells me, not only in the book of Genesis but from beginning to
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.040]   end.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.760]   That's why we are individually as we are by nature.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.080]   That's why the whole world is as it is at this very moment.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.680]   Man, estranged from God, frightened, attempting things beyond him, not able to manage himself,
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.480]   yet thinking he can put the universe right.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.120]   Here he is, a mass of contradictions, forces that he can't see, manipulating him.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.840]   He knows he's their victim, he can do nothing about them.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.560]   And above all, the wrath of God is on him.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:41.400]   God made the world that he might bless it, that it might enjoy companionship and fellowship
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.920]   with him, that it might reap the fruits of the earth and live in a state of glory.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.600]   But because of man's rebellion and alienation, the wrath of God is upon him.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.280]   My friends, this is God's world, and he won't allow us to have a happy time in it apart
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.960]   from him.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.120]   The world has been trying to do it, God won't allow it.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   It's God's world.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.840]   He will not allow us to be happy while we are breaking his laws and defying him and
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.520]   in a state of rebellion against him.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.300]   He will muddle our affairs, that's his wrath.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.780]   He will withdraw his restraining power that gives free reign to lusts and all your perversions
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.780]   are coming back.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.520]   That's the explanation.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.000]   And it is the only explanation.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.920]   All troubles are due to man's alienation from God, whether in the individual or whether
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.800]   in the entire human race.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.600]   This is the knowledge it gives me, and then it tells me that my greatest need, and the
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.760]   greatest need of the whole world, therefore, is to be right with God, somehow to get to
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.640]   know him, how to get his blessing back.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.720]   That's the need.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.520]   The problem isn't on the level of men.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.440]   All men need God and his blessing and his way of life.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.080]   How can we get back to him?
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   That's the question.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.960]   But nobody's considering it.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.000]   They're considering one another and their own moves and what arrangements, but you can't
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   make arrangements.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.680]   They've all been tried and they all break down.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.960]   The whole world is guilty before God, and it needs to be restored to God and to his
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   blessing.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   Here's the question.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.880]   Thank God the Bible answers it.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   That's point number two.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   There we've had an understanding as to the state of the world and its present condition,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.440]   but now the Bible goes on to tell us what God has done about that.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.440]   You see, this is fact.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   This is history.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.440]   This is the great central message of the Bible.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise!
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.200]   Oh, for a voice that I could lift up and sound like a trumpet!
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.600]   Did you hear the exhortation given to Jerusalem and to Zion?
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   Lift up thy voice!
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.080]   Oh, that I had a voice that the whole universe might hear at this moment, in its chaos, in
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.400]   its misery, in its unhappiness, in its utter hopelessness and despair.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   What's the message?
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   Here it is.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:11.040]   Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.400]   Is there anything else in the universe saying that tonight?
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   Is there any other comfort?
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.760]   Do you find consolation anywhere?
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.160]   Is there any message that gives you hope?
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   Here it is.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.160]   Listen to it.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.600]   It tells you what God has done.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.320]   There was Isaiah 40, an Old Testament prophet.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.120]   He is but typical of them all.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   They're all saying the same thing.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   What are they saying?
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   They say, "Prepare a highway for your God."
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:44.160]   They say, "Wait, look, all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.920]   Not man, not human relationships, not human conferences, suddenly salvation.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   No, no.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.400]   God's going to send someone to do this.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   Prepare the way for him.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Send for John the Baptist.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:01.160]   Bring down the mountains, lift up the valleys, make a flat, steady highway for our God, and
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.600]   call upon the nations to wait and to look and to turn.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   "Truly I, all flesh, shall see the salvation of God."
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.000]   That's the whole message of your Old Testament.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.280]   Did you know that?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.400]   That's its message from beginning to end.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   Starts in Genesis 3, 15.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.200]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.720]   Yes, there it is.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.880]   And so the comfort goes on.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:35.760]   And then we come, of course, to the fulfillment of the promise.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.240]   You want some comfort?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   You want consolation?
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Do you want any hope?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   Here it is.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.120]   "The world as it is, you say, is hopeless."
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   My friend, listen.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:57.000]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that "whosoever believeth in
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.560]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.760]   Season of Advent, Christmas is coming.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.160]   What's it mean?
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:13.520]   "Oh, this God hath visited and redeemed his people."
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:20.880]   God has done something about the chaos and the shame and the agony.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.000]   He has sent his only begotten beloved Son into this world.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   What for?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.640]   Well, to redeem it.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   What do we need?
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   What's our problem?
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   What's the difficulty?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   Isn't it first and foremost the guilt of our sin?
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.520]   We and the whole world have sinned against God.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.360]   We are under his wrath, I say, and that's why things go wrong.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.240]   We are not having the blessing of God because God blesseth not sinners.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.080]   How can I be delivered from the guilt of my sin?
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.520]   How can I know God as my Father?
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.920]   How can I go to him in prayer and with confidence ask for blessings?
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.800]   I can do nothing about it but God.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.640]   In his Son has provided the answer.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.000]   He has made the way.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.520]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has taken our sins upon himself and borne the guilt and
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.600]   the punishment and the shame.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:30.600]   And in him God forgives us and gives us free absolution, reconciles us unto himself and
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.880]   smiles upon us as our Father.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:48.360]   In our weakness he gives us new life, new strength, new power, new vigor.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:58.600]   He sends his Holy Spirit into us and unto the faint he gives strength.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:06.840]   And the young men shall faint and falter and be weary, but they that wait upon the Lord
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.080]   shall renew their strength.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.880]   They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.920]   They shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:26.040]   Here is the answer.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:38.480]   To our weakness and guilt and shame and lost condition, God has sent his only Son and has
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:47.880]   made a way of escape, a way of deliverance, a way of salvation.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   He has done it.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.720]   Comfort, consolation.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:01.960]   In this dark and unhappy and miserable world I am not alone any longer.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.200]   God is my God in Jesus Christ.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.080]   God is my Father.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:18.920]   God loves me with an everlasting love, and God will guide and protect and care for me.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   He has done it.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   Learning, information.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:32.520]   That is what God has already done.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:38.800]   But let me tell you in a final word what God is yet going to do.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:55.760]   patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.520]   Hope.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.040]   What of the future?
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.600]   What of my future?
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.280]   What of the world's future?
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.680]   Again man can't help me.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.920]   He can't see, can't penetrate through the mist.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.960]   He sees no hope.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.480]   The world, instead of getting better, seems to be getting worse.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.640]   All the schemes of men go wrong.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:35.520]   Every effort seems to lead to nothing but a fresh disaster.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.280]   Hope.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.280]   What of my future?
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:49.400]   What of the future of the whole world?
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.640]   Is there anything to look forward to?
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:46:01.600]   Is there anything apart from chaos, confusion, muddle, disaster, and a final end in an awful
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   explosion?
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.600]   What?
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:11.160]   And again, there is only one answer to the question.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.720]   It is the answer of this book.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.120]   The world is God's world, not men's.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.280]   God in the beginning created.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   He had a purpose.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.880]   He had a plan.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.440]   The cosmos is his.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.840]   It is still his.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.320]   And his plan is still in operation.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   What is the plan?
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   What is the purpose?
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:45.600]   Well, the purpose of God, according to the Bible, is this, is to restore the whole universe
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:52.400]   to the condition it was in before the fall.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:47:02.240]   The purpose of God is the deliverance of the whole universe from the ravages and the effects
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   of sin.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.560]   That is his purpose.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:15.520]   But if that is so, says someone, why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.760]   If you say that this is God's world and his purpose is to deliver it from all the effects
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:29.360]   and consequences of sin and evil, why is the world as it is?
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.040]   Why doesn't God intervene?
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.960]   Why doesn't God bring in order?
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.880]   Why does God allow these various things to happen?
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:47.240]   And the answer of the Bible is perfectly clear and perfectly plain.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.000]   God is not as men.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.600]   God is very patient.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:59.560]   God is everlasting and eternal and therefore with him a thousand years are but as one day
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.720]   and one day is as a thousand years.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   He isn't in time.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   He is above it.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   He is in eternity, everlasting.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:18.320]   Not only that, it is not God's will that anyone should perish.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:26.920]   So God is giving an opportunity, not desiring that any should perish.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:32.000]   He is allowing things to go on.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.160]   But look at the terrible things that are happening, says someone.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   Is God able?
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.080]   If he is, why doesn't he?
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.960]   Look what the devil is doing.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   What is your explanation?
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:54.680]   Well, it is all in these scriptures and this is where I find the comfort and the consolation
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.000]   of the scriptures.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:05.760]   God in his everlasting and eternal wisdom permits many things that I don't understand.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.240]   He has always done that.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.360]   Look at your Old Testament history.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.440]   Look how he allowed various nations to rise up against his people, to destroy them all
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.960]   must, take them into captivity and to become world conquerors.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.720]   And the Jews were trembling as a little remnant.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.080]   The enemy is triumphant and God seems to have failed.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:36.120]   But go on, read to the end of the story.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.640]   Don't stop halfway through and this is what you find.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.760]   Only when the enemy thought that he had conquered the people of God and that he was universally
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:52.080]   triumphant, God arose and scattered the enemy, destroyed him, made him a laughingstock.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.040]   Read your Old Testament history.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:03.960]   And God restored and blessed his foolish and rebellious people.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.600]   That's what he does.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:13.320]   And that is why Paul says that these things were written for our learning.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:20.120]   That we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:25.440]   It means this, that God appears to be defeated.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.760]   God appears to be weak and ineffective.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.480]   God seems to have forgotten.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.560]   The enemy seems to be triumphant all along the line.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:44.920]   Finally God arises, asserts himself, scatters his enemies and carries on his glorious purpose.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:53.080]   The supreme example of this, of course, was on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:59.120]   The very Son of God is taken in weakness and condemned, taken and nailed to a tree and
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.880]   dies and expires in utter weakness apparently.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   And the whole world was laughing and roaring, God's Son defeated, God's plan has gone
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   astray.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:16.400]   The end, no, no, resurrection, third day, rising triumphant, enemies confounded and
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.680]   scattered, here's the message.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   And it will be like that in the future.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.120]   I can't tell you why God is allowing things to happen as they're happening in this modern
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.200]   world, but it doesn't trouble me.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.040]   I see God just doing what he's done so many times before.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.520]   He's allowing the enemies to raise their heads.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.040]   He's allowing the enemy to think he's triumphant.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.880]   People say, "God is not there, he's ineffective, he's defeated.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.520]   Wait a minute, he will arise."
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.160]   The time is fixed.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.480]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came first into this world nearly two thousand years
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.040]   ago, is coming again.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.760]   The time is fixed.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.240]   I don't know when, he knows, the Father knows.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.960]   As he sent him, he will send him.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.000]   He will return a glorious, triumphant victor.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.200]   He will come on the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   What for?
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:31.360]   To scatter his enemies, to judge the world in righteousness, to take everything that
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:38.400]   hates God and cast it to perdition, with the final wrath of God upon it, forever and forever,
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.800]   without end, and all who have not believed in God.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.440]   That's what's coming, it is absolutely certain.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.960]   This is the scriptural teaching.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:50.840]   God's purpose, God's plan, will be carried out.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.920]   I don't know when, but it will be.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:58.440]   The God, I say, who in the Old Testament seemed to be hiding himself, always appeared.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.560]   He will yet appear.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:08.680]   And it will be to the final judgment, the last appearance, and the whole world will
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:14.560]   be judged in righteousness by God's Son.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:24.600]   And all that is evil will be consigned to everlasting perdition.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:36.440]   And then he will usher in the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.460]   It's all right, my friend.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.840]   This is not the only life.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.360]   This is not the only world.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.040]   This is a passing and a doomed world.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:59.800]   But there is another to come, a glorious world, a perfect world, a new world, a regeneration,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:06.520]   perfect earth, perfect heaven, perfect men and it, no evil, no sin, no war, no sign,
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:15.360]   no sorrow, no death, but everlasting life and everlasting glory.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.280]   That is the message.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.560]   That is the comfort and the consolation of the Scripture.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.080]   I don't know what the world may do to me.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.040]   It may kill me.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.920]   It may blast me to nothing.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.240]   It doesn't matter.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.000]   This is at best a passing world.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.440]   I know that the bomb is not the end.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:51.520]   There is a glory awaiting the children of God which passes description, a heaven and
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:55:02.120]   an earth, seeing God, seeing the Son, everything, even my body, renovated and renewed, glorified,
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:09.520]   for the animals changed, the whole cosmos working together, enjoying together, the glory
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.240]   of the everlasting, eternal and blessed God.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:20.080]   That's the teaching.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:28.520]   And it is that teaching that gives me comfort, consolation, encouragement and hope.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.360]   I'm not baffled, I'm not bewildered, I'm not surprised.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.840]   What amazes me is that things are not worse.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:43.040]   The teaching enlightens my mind.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.400]   I see the purpose of God being carried out and fulfilled.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.760]   I see God's threat against evil and disobedience actually coming to pass.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:59.160]   I see the world in turmoil because God has said, "There is no peace, saith my God,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   to the wicked."
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.120]   I see the confusion reigning, but I know that He's at the back of it all, He's above
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:11.120]   it all, and He will come, He'll send His Son.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:18.800]   And the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness are much more certain
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:22.000]   than this present passing world.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.720]   It's God, it's His purpose, and nothing can defeat Him.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:36.800]   Not only men, but enemies, hell, the devil, all shall be defeated and cast into an ultimate
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.000]   lake of perdition.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.520]   And God will be all and in all.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:54.880]   And all who believe this message shall be with Him in the glory everlasting.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:01.000]   My friend, does this comfort you?
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.640]   Is this consolation to you?
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.720]   Has this encouraged you?
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Does it thrill you?
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.600]   If it doesn't, you don't believe it.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:18.480]   Your blindness, the forces of evil are mastering you.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.720]   I can't believe that that is the truth.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   Don't you see it?
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.160]   Don't you see it all being verified?
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:37.520]   Believe it as the Word of God, submit to it, and begin to experience the comfort, the consolation,
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:44.000]   the encouragement, and the fortitude that nothing can give us in this world tonight
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.480]   but this message concerning the blessed hope of what God is yet going to do through His
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:03.840]   only begotten Beloved Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.680]   Amen.
