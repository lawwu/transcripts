[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   I want to react to something that has been going around the internet recently.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.200]   So I'm actually going to share something on the screen here.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.480]   So again, this is the deeplife.com or youtube.com/calnewportmedia to watch this episode, episode 262.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.080]   I've loaded up a YouTube video.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.000]   I won't have the audio on, but I have closed captioning on.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   All right, so this is a video from Better Ideas, a popular channel.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   It's 2 million subscribers.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.400]   And the title of this video is "How overstimulation is ruining your life."
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.320]   And we see there's a young man on screen here in the woods looking earnestly at the camera.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.560]   And I have the closed captioning on.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.720]   So I'm going to play this and read you a little bit of what he's saying.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.440]   He's saying, "During certain periods of my life..."
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   Oh, that...
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.720]   Remember when I said the volume was off?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720]   The volume was very much on.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   Let me turn that off here.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   Sorry about that.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   All right.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   "During various periods of my life, I have a very difficult time focusing on pretty much
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.000]   anything important or difficult.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.320]   During these periods, it seems almost impossible to break out of the social media limbo where
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600]   you're just constantly switching between tabs, refreshing pages, kind of waiting for something
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.440]   interesting to happen, like for someone to post a cool photo or Instagram or something.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.680]   You're kind of waiting to be entertained.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.580]   But if you actually have to apply yourself, it's extremely difficult, borderline painful
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.680]   to do so.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.880]   And I'm pretty sure almost everyone can relate to this problem.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.400]   I'm sure you've seen a lot of videos on YouTube giving you little tips and tricks as to how
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.960]   to better focus, including my own channel.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.480]   But there are very few videos kind of diving in, talking about why it's so difficult to
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.680]   focus on hard things.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.320]   You know, like what's the deal?
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.960]   Why can't we just sit down and do something important with very little strain?"
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   All right.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920]   So that's the start of that video on better ideas.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.440]   And he goes on to get into some of the neuroscience of why we're distracted so easily when we're
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.360]   trying to work on something hard.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.000]   And it's a neuroscience explanation you may have heard before, but essentially our dopamine
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   system which generates that urge to do something that's going to generate a reward.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.040]   Keep in mind, we often get that a little bit wrong.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   I think in common parlance, we often think about dopamine as being a source of rewards.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.320]   The dopamine itself is what makes you feel a lot of pleasure.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.560]   Dopamine is what gives you that urge to do the thing that you think is going to give
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   you the reward.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.840]   It's when you have an addiction, it's the dopamine that makes it so irresistible to
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.000]   grab that cigarette because it wants the other rewards you're going to get when you actually
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   smoke the cigarette.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.240]   So what is talked about in this video is this common neuroscience explanation that the dopamine
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.360]   system is firing up to get those quick hit rewards of seeing the video that's really
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.280]   interesting, seeing the post that's a little bit scandalous, seeing the like number jump
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.840]   on something you did earlier, which gives you this big burst of people like me, they
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.340]   really like me.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.520]   The dopamine system likes rewards.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.140]   It wants rewards now.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.640]   The internet has many rewards lined up.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.640]   The system kicks in the play and you feel this irresistible desire to click, click,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   click.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.960]   You do not get a similar dopamine push for I'm working for our 900 of 10,000.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.040]   It's going to take me to finish this really big project because the reward's not proximate.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.560]   And so what's going to win then?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.000]   The complicated deep thing, part of your slow productivity push to do something big over
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   a long period of time or Instagram or TikTok.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.080]   And he said, yeah, your brain is wired to go for that.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.320]   And that's a very hard, that's a very hard challenge to win.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.520]   And now what I learned from this video is that, yes, he is right.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.740]   There are lots of videos that talk about this same thing, quote unquote overstimulation.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.840]   People are really feeling it.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.800]   And I think young people are feeling it harder because they have more targets for their dopamine
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   systems.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.040]   They've more acclimatized their mind to all of these various rewards.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.680]   They're very good at these various rewards.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.480]   There's so much pulling at them that young people in particular are really finding.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.800]   Yes, this is ruining my life.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.040]   I can't do anything long-term, deep, cognitively useful.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.720]   I'm getting bad grades at school.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.160]   I can't advance in my job.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.920]   I can't produce something that I really want to produce.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.240]   Those of us my age or older maybe say I distract myself too much and it slows down me doing
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.960]   important work.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.120]   Young people really do feel like it's ruining their lives.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   So what should we do about it?
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.840]   Well, I thought, well, I can offer my own advice here.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.960]   I mean, this is something I've studied and written about for a long time.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   I kind of wrote the definitive book on the power of focus and why you should cultivate
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   it.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.200]   I've been thinking and writing articles and books about this for a long time.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.880]   So I figured let me review here on the podcast my own very complicated multi-part system
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.220]   for combating online overstimulation.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.000]   So get a pad of paper ready because you don't want to miss step nine or 10.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.320]   There's a very complicated explanation for how you're going to have to very carefully
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.840]   navigate the online world.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.120]   All right, so it's going to be very complicated.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   Are you ready?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   Okay, here it goes.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.900]   Here's my solution.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.240]   Don't use things that cause overstimulation.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   All right.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.700]   I'm being a little bit facetious here, but honestly, the answer is as simple as that.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.020]   Dopamine system is powerful.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.680]   So don't give it the targets that it's going to fire up for.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.160]   You have to actually remove most of these sources of overstimulation from your life
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.680]   if you really want to start thinking and producing original thoughts at a high level.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.800]   There's not these complex habits and careful ways of navigating your notifications and
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.960]   when you use this and when you don't use this.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.480]   I'm telling you this as someone who thinks for a living and studies people who thinks
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.880]   for a living, the more sources of overstimulation you eliminate from your life, the easier.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.000]   And we of course know this type of abstention approach is effective because we see it with
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.920]   other things that historically have hijacked the dopamine system and caused a lot of trouble.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.420]   We do not tell people who have an issue with smoking, okay, we need to build a complex
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.520]   system of where you have cigarettes and where you don't, and you don't want to have it in
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.840]   the car, but you will have it here.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.320]   And we're going to have an app that keeps track of how many cigarettes you've had and
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.080]   then try to restrict, then during certain periods, there's a time lock that locks off
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   the cigarettes and you can't have it during that period, but you can't have it on this
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.680]   period and we do a week on, but you don't smoke on Saturdays.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.560]   No, we just say you got to quit smoking.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.120]   As the same with a lot of other addictions like this that people have trouble with, but
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   we resist applying that type of clarity and abstention to online overstimulation.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.560]   So let me get a little bit more granular about this.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.780]   Social media, this is a big source of it.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.860]   You got to just basically get this out of your life.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.720]   If you have to have some social media for professional reasons, it should not be on
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   your phone.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.840]   It should be on a boring computer.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.640]   It's something you should do on a schedule or hire someone to do on your behalf.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.880]   It should never, ever be something you go to when you're bored.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.120]   It should never be a source of distraction.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.840]   It should be, I'm an author and I set up my Instagram post in a shared document on Google
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.200]   Drive.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.360]   Here's the photos, here's the text, and I have someone who posts it Fridays and Mondays.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.240]   Or if I have to do that, I log in the thing on my computer, I post it, and then I shut
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   it back down again.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   All right?
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.040]   So if you have to use it professionally, it's on a computer, it's boring, you never use
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.360]   it as a source of entertainment.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.200]   You don't scroll online news.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.760]   Look, you're not an editor at Gawker.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.600]   You just get out of that world of online news and discussion.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   You don't have to be a part of it.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.720]   How do you keep up with stuff in the world?
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.560]   We talked about this earlier in this episode where I gave advice to Reading Guy.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.120]   You know, subscribe to some email newsletters that you read when you can that gives you
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.000]   interesting perspectives.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.280]   Listen to podcasts, maybe listen to a daily news roundup podcast if you want to be kept
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.840]   up with more current events.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   Or listen to something like Sager and Crystal's, their Breaking Points podcast where they go
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   through 10 stories about what's going on in the world.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   Podcasts are fine, right?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.640]   Because it's something you have to turn on and listen to.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.720]   It's not a knee-jerk distraction that your dopamine system is going to kick into.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.080]   No one is like trying to write and halfway through writing, they're like, "Ahh!"
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.160]   You can quickly turn on a podcast.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.520]   TikTok can do that.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   Online news can do that.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.520]   Twitter can do that.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   Podcasts are fine.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   Newsletters are fine.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   Maybe even print out the articles you like and read them when you get a chance.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   That's fine.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You'll be informed.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.240]   You got to get rid of all that online news.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   What about YouTube?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   YouTube is tricky.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   Why is YouTube tricky?
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   I think video is the future of independent content creation, but the recommendations
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   and sidebar on YouTube can make it into one of these dopamine-inflamming sources of distraction.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.640]   When it comes to something like YouTube, you have to use it one way and not another.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.920]   This is maybe the place where I come closest to the navigation lines that you hear in a
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.560]   lot of these online videos.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   I do think YouTube is a source of information.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:28.260]   YouTube has become more a source of entertainment, high-quality entertainment that rivals what
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.120]   you would get on TV, but it's also a giant source of distraction.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.760]   How do we make sense of YouTube?
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.380]   Here's my YouTube strategy.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.080]   In order to preserve YouTube as a way to look up instructions for things, which I think
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   is a great use of YouTube, how do I change the oil in a Honda Odyssey?
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.240]   Look it up on YouTube.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.660]   You can see a video of someone doing it.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.320]   It's better than trying to find an article.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.660]   To preserve that use of YouTube without it making a dopamine-inflamming system, get one
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:03.680]   of these plugins for your browser that you use YouTube on that gets rid of the recommendations.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.040]   So what you can do is you can search for something.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   You can see the search results.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.120]   You can click on a search result.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.500]   You can watch it, but there's no, "Here's what's coming up next," or "What about this
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.040]   and what about that?"
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.800]   That one type of plugin alone makes YouTube into a fantastic library without it being
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.480]   something that you can use as a source of knee-jerk distraction.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.600]   Because again, when you're working on something hard, if you have blocked YouTube, you go,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.040]   "Oh, I should go to YouTube.com."
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   You don't see anything.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.280]   You have to search for something and find something.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.440]   It's not a highly salient source of distraction.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.800]   Now, what about entertainment on YouTube?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.200]   Because again, I think this is actually important.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.320]   I'm a believer that video trumps audio.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   The future of independent content is going to be video.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.800]   I mean, this is like radio became a big thing until television was around, and then television
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.080]   just smashed the market share of radio.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.540]   It was just so much bigger because humans like to see faces.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.600]   Humans like to see visuals.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:03.720]   And I increasingly believe watching a high-quality interview show on YouTube is better than 99%
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:10.960]   of the stuff that's on television or that's on non-unscripted streaming services.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.600]   And I think that gap's going to close more.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.620]   So how do you, for example, watch a show like mine?
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.800]   Or maybe you're a Lex Fridman fan.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.940]   You want to watch his interviews.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.720]   How do you watch these type of programming as a substitute for lower-quality television
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.000]   with, again, not having YouTube be a rabbit hole?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.800]   And my answer here is television sets.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.920]   I learned this from our YouTube guide, Jeremy, that increasingly televisions are becoming
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.460]   one of the most common devices on which this style of YouTube video is watched.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.640]   So if you're going to look something up, you have a browser with a plugin that blocks the
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.240]   recommendations.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.160]   If you're going to watch "independent high-quality content" on YouTube, you have it on the YouTube
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.760]   app and your Apple TV or Fire Stick on your television.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.320]   And you watch it like you would any other television show in the same circumstances
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.640]   where you would watch television.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.040]   I'm sitting down with a lunch break.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.320]   I take out my remote.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   I turn on the TV.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   I go to the YouTube app.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.140]   I search for the latest episode of whatever, and I put it on the TV.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.040]   There's a lot of friction in using a television.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.280]   There's also a lot of routine and ritual built into televisions where that's not part of
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.360]   your dopamine cycle.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.320]   When you're in your home office trying to write something, you don't rush downstairs
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.920]   and turn on the TV and go to Netflix and select a show and turn it on.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.640]   That's too much overhead.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.120]   The television you think about, "Oh, I'm going to have a meal.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.640]   I'm taking a break."
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.520]   It's a big production to get it going.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.720]   So you move high-quality independent media consumption to the television and looking
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.360]   up to a browser-protected, a plugin-protected browser.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.640]   Now you don't have to worry about something like YouTube in your life being a source of
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.000]   distraction.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.760]   Also throw in place better, less dopamine-susceptible entertainment sources to fill the gap that
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.200]   the highly salient distracting content is probably filling right now.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.440]   And get back into music.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.940]   Go see good movies and read about them before and after.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.400]   Read much more books.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.440]   High-quality streaming content.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.560]   High-quality podcasts.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.440]   Get your mind used to other sorts of much higher-quality content for the entertainment
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.720]   and distraction.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.040]   The lower-quality stuff will begin to seem less palatable.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   Same thing happens with food.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.000]   You eat a lot of junk food.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's really addictive.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.520]   "My God, I just need chips and cookies and this makes me feel better.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.800]   What else would I want to eat?"
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   You stop doing it for a while.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   You start eating better food.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.920]   You start cooking yourself.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.080]   You go to the farmer's market.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.840]   You're using high-quality ingredients.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.920]   Everyone will tell you this.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.320]   You start eating well.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.080]   A Snickers bar or a Chips Ahoy seems weird.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   It's cardboard.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   It's fake.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   It's too sugary.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   You don't crave it anymore.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.840]   So you don't break this connection to junk food by just white-knuckling and eating less.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.080]   You replace it with better food.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.040]   So that's the final part of solving overstimulation is introducing flooding the zone with much
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.920]   more quality stimulation so that you lose your taste for a TikTok video.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.840]   You lose your taste for an inflammatory online article that someone tweeted and that you're
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.120]   scrolling through and then clicking the other links.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.900]   So again, this is how I think you solve overstimulation.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.600]   If you're serious about it, you get rid of most of the sources of overstimulation.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.280]   You stop using social media, you stop doing online news surfing, you put in a lot of high-quality
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   content and in the few places where you might need to encounter these worlds, YouTube looking
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.240]   things up or high-quality independent media, you have to do some limited social media for
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   your work.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.280]   You do so in a way that makes it so far from being a source of knee-jerk distraction that
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.600]   your dopamine system forgets about it.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.560]   So anyways, I appreciated that video.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   Overstimulation is a problem.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.240]   I'm glad people care about it.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.060]   But let's just get blunt.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.120]   Stop doing the thing that's ruining your life.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.140]   Stop smoking.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.480]   Stop eating the junk food.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.880]   Replace it with something better.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.080]   Let's not get too cute about this.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.820]   Let's not get too fine grained.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.040]   Life without the overstimulation really is a deeper life.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.480]   It really is a more intellectually engaged life.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   It really is going to be a more successful life.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.080]   You are going to produce ideas that astound you.
