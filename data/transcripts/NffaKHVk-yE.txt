[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Is that a camera?
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500]   That's incredible.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.500]   DJI, look at it.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500]   Is that better than your phone?
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Maybe because you don't have a knife?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's incredible quality.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500]   Here with Joe Rogan at the weigh-ins.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.000]   Oh, hi.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.500]   You get nervous before these things?
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000]   No, I get excited, though.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   How do you prepare for all the names you have to read off?
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   I have to get them written out phonetically.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   When you look at these guys, do you see excitement? Do you see fear?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   What do you usually see?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   The fighters?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Yeah, when they stay up.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You never see fear.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   You saw fear when Anderson Silva was in his prime.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   You saw some fear.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   When guys reach this unstoppable level, you see some fear.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   But you don't generally just see anxiety and tension.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   You see guys getting fired up for a fight.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Intensity?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Intensity, for sure.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Who is the most intense guy you've seen at the weigh-ins?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Ever?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Conor gets pretty fucking intense, but so does Khabib.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   It all depends on whether or not they have real animosity towards each other.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Nate Diaz is probably somebody that gets pretty intense.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh, yeah, he's going to get intense. That's going to be a good one.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I don't know how they're going to separate him from Hamza and him from everyone else.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   You think it's going to get crazy today?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   It could get crazy.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And what are you going to do? Are you going to be all right?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm going to get the fuck out of there.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   If shit gets wild, I'm not getting in the scrap.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You're going to watch me look like a coward.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Also here with Shane Gillis, you're going to step up if shit goes down?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'll get in there.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I might have to get in and get knocked out by a 120-pounder.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Do you ever lose your voice with these things?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   No.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   No, I yell all the time.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You get it.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Because of doing comedy, my voice is pretty strong.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   This is like such a surreal moment in human history, the war of combat.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Like, more innovation has happened in combat in the past 20 years than maybe ever in human history.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   You're at the center of it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Does that hit you? At which point does that hit you?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Before big fights, it's always like goosebumps.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It starts building up?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Like before Leon Edwards and Kamaru Usmano, it's like, "Whew, here we go."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You know, your whole body just tingles. All your skin tingles.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And then the shock might happen like it did in that fight.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   When something crazy happens, your whole body just jolts.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's so wild, you know?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You see people standing up and screaming, "Oh, my God," behind you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And then you become a meme.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yeah, I'm a meme often.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But the last one, when Leon Edwards knocked out Kamaru, you see me and DC freaking out behind us.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Tony Hinchcliffe goes, "Oh, my God!"
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's amazing. It was amazing.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   All right, brother. Thank you for giving us a behind-the-scenes look.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   My pleasure.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Here we go!
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Give it up for Hunter!
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Sean Shelby and Nick Mayhem!
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Last night was extraordinary!
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We had a lot of changes in this car, but I think it's even better!
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   [announcer speaking]
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   [crowd cheering]
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   How do you feel after that?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It was exciting! Very intense.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It was, uh...
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's gonna be one of those cards where it's like, no one prepared for that opponent.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So you have three fights that have been completely reworked.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so these guys have to adjust, and, you know, there's very different opponents.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Okay, well, what happened was Hamzat Shumayev didn't make weight, and he missed weight by eight and a half pounds,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   which is so crazy that they wouldn't let them fight each other.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So they had to move that.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So now you have Li Jinglian versus Daniel Rodriguez.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Rodriguez was supposed to be fighting Kevin Holland.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then Hamzat was supposed to be fighting Nate Diaz, missed weight by a ton.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   But honestly, Tony Ferguson versus Nate Diaz is a much better fight.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Much more competitive fight.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And Hamzat versus Kevin Holland is a real test for Hamzat.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Kevin Holland is a big guy.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He fought at 185 pounds before.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He was very successful, knocked people out, including Joaquin Buckley at 185.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You think Holland is ready for the fight?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That's a real test.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's chaos. It's a surprise.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's a totally different kind of fight.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   He's a chaos kind of guy, though.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I mean, I think it's an exciting fight.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm excited about it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You think Hamzat is ready?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Well, I don't like the fact that he missed weight.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's a lot to miss weight by.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So there's, like, two things could happen.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   He missed weight because he didn't prepare properly, which usually indicates either that he was sick or injured,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   or he didn't want to make the weight.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You know, maybe he was, like, so worked up by all this Nate Diaz stuff that he didn't want to get in the sauna.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   He didn't want to cut the weight.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Who knows what's going on.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We don't know.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   We really don't know.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You'd have to get friends with him where he could confide in you and he'd tell you the truth.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It was amazing to see you do this in person and amazing to see the fighters in person.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's intense. Tomorrow's going to be even crazier.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So you have to know what the angles are.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   So, like, this shot right here, this is a perfect example.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   This seems like an easy shot.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But you know what's not an easy shot?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's getting to that ball down there.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So that ball, when the ball's down there like that, like kind of in the middle, but not in front of that hole or that hole.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   There's only two places to be on that hole.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You have to be on the right side of the ball or the left side of the ball.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Now, when you have something like this that's right in front of the hole, it seems like, well, that's an easy shot.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But you have to make sure that you have the right speed to hit this here.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And then it's got to go like this and then all the way down to here.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Oh, so two walls. It's got to bounce on this one, that one.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   All right.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Basically three rails, maybe.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Three rails.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And that little, like, a tap on the other one.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But it's all like a gentle touch.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Got it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Wow, that's strong. That's strong.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   See the difference?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It looks like that's easy, but that's not easy at all.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's like one of the harder shots is to get yourself where you're in a perfect position to make the next ball.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   How'd you get into oping, Anthony?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I was in bands with my brother, and I would write song parodies about everything that was happening in the news.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And the OJ thing, you might have heard of that, happened, and I wrote a song parody about it.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Opie played it on his show, WBAB on Long Island, and people loved it.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And he goes, "Hey, can you come in and do it live?"
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And me and my brother were like, "Yeah, I came in, did it live."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And I thought this was my shot.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I just poured everything out. I started doing impressions.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I was commenting on the news.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And Opie goes, "Dude, that was really good. Why don't you come in next week again?"
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And it just snowballed from there.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   We got an offer to go to Boston, and I never looked back.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I threw my sheet metal worker tools out on '95 on my way up to Boston.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's all about knowing the cue ball speed and knowing how a ball is going to come off the ball when it contacts it at an angle.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And you get completely obsessive because it's so hard to predict.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And then the more you do it, the more you get muscle memory, and the more you kind of understand where the ball is going.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So you're not even thinking too much. You're using intuition.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   There's a lot of thinking and a lot of intuition.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's like both things are happening at the same time.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's super complicated.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's fascinating.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   [music]
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   [music]
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   [music]
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   [music]
