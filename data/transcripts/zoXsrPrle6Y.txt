[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   When we win, we feel like we can keep going, right?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   You look at the team that wins and it's like,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.500]   they'll play another game.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.340]   The Superbowl winners,
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.840]   or you imagine they're jumping up and down
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.560]   and they could probably play another Superbowl.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.160]   Losing, we know can,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.800]   sure it can drop things like testosterone and dopamine
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.760]   for some period of time.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.080]   But when you were in the teams,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.920]   what was your observation about how winning and losing
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.400]   would impact people in the short and long-term?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.780]   In other words, would you observe people
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.400]   that had a quick reset button
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800]   and could just say that was terrible?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.720]   And then transmute,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.480]   I guess I'm getting into kind of the Eastern language now,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   convert that into energy to go do better the next time.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.380]   Whereas we also see people, military
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.120]   and in the civilian world,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560]   that a loss, in particular severe losses,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.880]   basically set them down the path of like less energy.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.240]   It certainly isn't less calories.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.440]   In fact, most of the time it's the other way.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.720]   They start consuming more calories
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.680]   and that doesn't get them going.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.280]   So again, this notion of energy,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.000]   and now I'm asking wins versus losses,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.360]   what did you observe?
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.440]   And from the perspective of leadership,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   and maybe more importantly,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.800]   from the perspective of yourself,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500]   how do you work with that?
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.440]   How do you calibrate wins and losses?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.260]   How do you transmute losses into energy?
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.480]   Because wins we know convert to energy,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.840]   but losses oftentimes can sap our energy way, way down.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.440]   - I think to start with,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.280]   I think that the selection process
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.600]   to get into the SEAL teams
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.700]   is going to weed out a bunch of people
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.240]   that can't recover very quickly from something bad.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840]   So you probably heard these type of stories before.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   The kid that was the star of the football team,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420]   the star of the basketball team,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.960]   the captain of this, the captain of that,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.120]   he's been winning his whole life.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   He goes to Bud's and he quits.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160]   Because in Bud's, you're not gonna win.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   You're certainly not gonna win everything.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.000]   They're gonna find what you're not good at,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   and they're gonna exploit that, and you're gonna lose.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.400]   This is what happens.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.280]   So a lot of guys that may lose
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600]   and it disrupts their motivation,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.840]   they're probably just gonna quit.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.280]   And so that's why you get this massive attrition rate
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.480]   with guys that are studs.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.360]   I mean, we're talking Division I athletes.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.000]   Division I athlete, Division I wrestlers,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.160]   Division I football players,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   Division I runners and swimmers,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.120]   they all come to Bud's, they all quit.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.320]   Not all of them quit, but there's plenty of examples
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.200]   of the highest level of collegiate athlete
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.040]   in sports that translate very well
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.960]   to what you're doing in basic SEAL training, and they quit.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.400]   And sometimes it's because they don't know how to lose,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.680]   they don't know how to recover from a loss,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   and they're just, so I think already,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.920]   and once you get to a SEAL team,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.000]   you've got people that are, generally speaking,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.240]   gonna be pretty resilient
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.680]   when it comes to dealing with a loss.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.280]   Not only that, I mean, you just get used,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.080]   you talk about losing people.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.480]   You're friends with this guy,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.040]   you meet this guy in SEAL training.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.600]   Hey, this guy seems like a stud.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, he's just gonna quit.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.800]   And you're gonna lose five, six, seven people, eight people.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600]   People quit so fast, you don't even keep track of them.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.880]   So you're just gonna lose, you're just gonna get used to it.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   So there's that.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.400]   Now, once you're in the teams,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.520]   and what you're talking about
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.360]   is now you start taking much more significant loss.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.200]   You're not losing a race,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.160]   you're losing one of your friends.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.640]   And this is what, from a leadership perspective,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   you have to pay attention to.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.480]   So when you're a leader in any organization,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   you're basically in charge of a mob.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.720]   When it comes to what their morale is,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.240]   they're a mob, and they feed off of each other
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.000]   just like a mob riding in the streets,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.120]   going, oh, we can break this window,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.960]   let's break all the windows.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.320]   And they move this mob mentality.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.840]   And that happens with morale inside of a team.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.960]   And you as a leader can't get caught up with the mob.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.120]   You can't let that happen.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.040]   You have to detach yourself from the mob mentally
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.440]   so that you don't get caught up
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.680]   in their emotions and their morale.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.760]   Because if you get caught up in their emotions
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.640]   and you get caught up in their morale, you can't correct it.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.880]   So we go out on a mission.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.760]   The mission goes great.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.920]   We get into a gunfight, kill a couple of bad guys,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.120]   everyone's okay, high fives, everyone's feeling great.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.520]   You come back to base,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.480]   hey, we don't need to debrief, that was perfect.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.840]   Hey, we don't need to get our gear maintained.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.200]   We can just go to bed, we're awesome.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.120]   That's when the leader has to say, oh, we've got the mob,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   and the mob is becoming slightly arrogant.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   Hey guys, real quick, that was a good op,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.360]   but there's some things we could improve on.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.440]   You got to bring that mob back
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   and bring them back to center line.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.920]   Same thing in the other direction.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.800]   You go out on an operation, it doesn't go well.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.960]   You go out on an operation, you take casualties.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.120]   Now you come back to base, you see guys moping around,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   you see the spirit starting to break, and same thing.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.840]   If you're part of that mob, you'll be with them,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.240]   your morale will be breaking, your spirit will be breaking.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.360]   You got to look at them and say, oh, I see what's happening.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.640]   Hey guys, listen up.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.840]   That was tough, didn't go the way we wanted it to go.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.440]   We need to learn some lessons.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.920]   Here's some things I can do better.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.220]   What can we do better to make sure
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.720]   that that never happens again?
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.360]   What can we do to make sure we have the opportunity
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   to go out and avenge our brother on the battlefield?
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.320]   What can we do to move this thing forward?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   So as a leader, when it comes to winning and losing,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.400]   you're generally going to be the person
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.600]   countering what the mob mentality is.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   'Cause when the mob starts winning,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.520]   they want to keep winning and they might get arrogant.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.400]   When the mob is losing, they might start to lose more
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.160]   because their attitude goes down the drain.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.780]   So that's what you have to pay attention to
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.240]   from a leadership perspective.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.220]   For me personally, I think,
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.220]   I know what I did when I lost guys was focus on,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.080]   all right, we need to celebrate the life.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   We need to mourn the loss and then we need to go to work.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.160]   We need to get our gear back on.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.720]   We need to lock and load our weapons.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.840]   We need to get back out there.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.120]   I know that that's what we needed to do.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   So often, the best way to contend with problems,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   with issues, with adversity is action, is by taking action.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.680]   The more you sit and the more you wait
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.080]   and the more time you spend with that adversity,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.640]   with the upper hand inside your head,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.880]   the worse it's going to get.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   So for me, always taking action, making something happen.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.480]   It doesn't have to be huge.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.160]   It doesn't have to be some mammoth triumph
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.440]   that you're going to go and pursue.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.560]   But if you say, "Hey, listen, this is what happened.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.580]   "Didn't go the way we wanted it to.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.500]   "We're going to get our gear back on.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.460]   "We're going to go back out.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.320]   "We're going to do this other mission."
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.880]   And that's what I think.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.240]   I think taking action, and it's in your personal life too.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.160]   You know, something doesn't go the way you wanted it to go.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.420]   You didn't get the job you wanted.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.260]   You didn't get the hire.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.640]   You didn't get the promotion.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.720]   You can go home and sit there and dwell on it.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.080]   That's not getting you any progress.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.720]   Or you say, "Okay, you know what?
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.620]   "Let me do a quick analysis.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.800]   "Why didn't I get that promotion?
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.220]   "Oh, it's 'cause I didn't get this qualification,
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.740]   "or I hadn't jumped through this gate.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.580]   "Okay, cool.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.400]   "What do I need?
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.200]   "Let me look into how do I get to jump through that gate
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.440]   "so next time I will get the promotion."
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.920]   And you start taking action.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.080]   So action for me is a cure for a lot of problems
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   that we have in life.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.960]   (upbeat music)
