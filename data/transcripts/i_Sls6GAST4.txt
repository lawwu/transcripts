[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   I'm glad that I had done the work of creating a home that was calm and peaceful, a home
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.480]   that I wanted to be in, a home that wasn't adding stress to my life.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.280]   Not to mention, I felt like I had saved a lot of money by pursuing minimalism and buying
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.440]   less stuff.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.640]   I felt freer, I felt less tied down to the place that I was confined to be in.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.480]   I think some people early on were like, "Boy, I bet you're regretting becoming a minimalist
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.800]   now that you're stuck inside your home."
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.720]   And I'm like, "No, just the opposite.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.480]   I feel free, I feel like we could get up and move if we needed to."
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.960]   I felt like I had saved up some money along the way.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.560]   It's not that my home is empty.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.920]   There's still things to do in my home and I thought I brought a lot of intentionality
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   into my life.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.600]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.040]   money and travel.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.560]   I've always known I wanted to do an episode on minimalism because I'm fascinated by it.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.400]   I'm not anywhere close to a hoarder, but I certainly struggle myself with getting rid
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   of things that I might need or want to use one day.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.240]   Well, a few weeks ago, I got connected with Joshua Becker and I knew that our conversation
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.540]   would make for a great episode.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.000]   For those of you who don't know him, he's the founder of Becoming Minimalist, a website
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620]   that's inspired millions of visitors around the world.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.960]   He's also the best-selling author of The More of Less, The Minimalist Home, and most
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.180]   recently, Things That Matter, Overcoming Distractions to Pursue a More Meaningful Life.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.960]   It just came out last week and it's a fantastic read.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.740]   In our conversation, we'll talk about what most people get wrong about minimalism, why
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.720]   owning less can bring more meaning to life, ways to get started without jumping straight
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.400]   into the deep end, and the big distractions outside of just stuff that get in the way
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.500]   of focusing on the things that matter in life.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.260]   Joshua, thank you for being here.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.440]   Well, thank you for having me here.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   It's a pleasure.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.720]   I'm going to jump right in.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.040]   What do you think most people get wrong when they think about minimalism?
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.640]   Well, I've been writing about minimalism for 13 years or so and I think when I first started,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.100]   the misconceptions were this was going to be a barren, empty home.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.120]   And I think we kind of shaken that misconception quite a bit.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.360]   The misconception that I fight against the most is that minimalism is about checking
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   out of life, that minimalism is about quitting my job as soon as I possibly can, not contributing
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   anything to the world and just laying out a beach for the rest of my life.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.800]   In my mind, minimalism is about removing physical distractions, removing possessions so that
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.700]   I can live a bigger life that accomplishes more good for the world than if I was carrying
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.740]   around a bunch of stuff that I didn't need.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.600]   Why is it so important, especially right now, for people to think this way and give it a
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   consider?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.420]   Yeah, because never at any point in human history have human beings owned as much stuff
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.700]   as we do now.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940]   Things are cheaper than ever.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.000]   Things are more accessible and more available.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.200]   I mean, with the click of a button, I can get things delivered to my home in an hour.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   The stats are pretty fascinating.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.720]   The average American home has tripled in size in the last 50 years and still 10% of Americans
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960]   rent offsite storage.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.320]   The LA Times one time printed that the average American home has 300,000 items inside of
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   it.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.040]   And I think the more you accumulate, then the more of a physical burden, the more of
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   a mental burden, just the more time all of our things take from us.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.760]   So yeah, I think it's probably more important than ever to be intentional about the things
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.640]   we're allowing into our homes and lives.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   I'm thinking as you say that, "Gosh, how many things are in my house?"
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   And I don't even know if I want to know the answer, but you write a lot about the how
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.080]   of decluttering and minimization and all of that stuff.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.200]   But it seems like the why, kind of the internal work you have to do is almost more or maybe
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.480]   as much as important.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   Is that true?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.760]   I mean, certainly the how.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.360]   Owning less is better than thinking about owning less.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.080]   So it's one thing to be introduced to the idea, to be drawn to the idea of removing
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.040]   distractions.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   It's something completely different to actually begin walking down that road.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.560]   Whenever I help people go through this process, the first thing that I always have people
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.400]   do is sit down and answer this question.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.200]   I desire to own less so that I can blank.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.400]   You fill in the blank however you want.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.480]   What is the goal?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   What is the purpose?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.240]   For me, it was a Saturday morning, cleaning out my garage while I wish I was playing with
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.360]   my son.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.640]   And I could just see how all the things I owned were distracting me and taking me away
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.560]   from spending time with my family.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.520]   And so, I literally just want to spend more time with my family.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.320]   But other people, they want to own less so you can travel more or you can retire early
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.240]   or get out of debt or there's environmental reasons behind your pursuit.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   But nailing the why, I think is pretty important because the goal of minimalism is never just
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.560]   to own the fewest amount of things as possible.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.240]   Minimalism is always just a means to an end of some sort.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.040]   And so, knowing that, number one, I think provides the motivation and the momentum.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.960]   For most people, decluttering their possessions is hard work, requires physical work and emotional
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   work and mental work.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.200]   And so, I think having that goal, knowing why they want to do it is helpful.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   When I wrote my first book, The More of Less, I learned a little bit about publishing pretty
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   early on.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.720]   It was one of our early - we met in the Denver airport for lunch with some of the vice presidents
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.600]   and publishers and editors, and they asked me the question, "What do you want to name
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.220]   the book?"
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.760]   And I said, "Well, I thought I'd name the book Becoming Minimalist."
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.720]   And she said, "Well, you can't name the book Becoming Minimalist."
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.080]   And I said, "Oh, I can't?"
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.620]   And she said, "No.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.720]   Becoming Minimalist is the process that gets you somewhere.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.440]   Like, what is the promise of minimalism?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.240]   That's the title of your book, not the process.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   Make it the promise."
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.000]   So, that was my first introduction to publishing.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I like it.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.160]   The promise of The More of Less.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.200]   The More of Less, Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own was the first book
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.120]   and that then became the title, which I think that's the promise, right?
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.500]   I don't think anyone's desire in life is just to own as much stuff as they possibly can.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.840]   We certainly have bigger dreams for our lives than that.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   When it comes to the how, what are the hacks to actually do that?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.320]   So, let's say I've decided, "Okay, now I don't want a lot of stuff."
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.900]   It's surely not as easy as just, "Well, just get rid of it all."
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.040]   Do you start with a room?
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   Do you start with a category?
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.440]   Do you have any advice to someone who's gone through the process to find their why?
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.560]   Do they do it gradually or all at once?
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.320]   There are some people who can do it all in a weekend.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.360]   I know a friend who, as soon as he heard about minimalism, rented a dumpster and was like
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.280]   done by the end of the day.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.240]   But that's a pretty small percentage of people, although if you can pull it off and if that's
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.980]   your type of personality, then it's certainly better than taking six or nine months to declutter
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.720]   your home.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.320]   But if you're married and you got two kids and you got 15 years of stuff in your home,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.040]   then it probably takes a little more time and a little more effort.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.480]   The strategy that I use, the method that I have found to be the most helpful for the
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:16.600]   most number of people is to work through your home, easiest to hardest, starting with the
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.180]   most lived in areas first.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:28.080]   So some folks would say category by category, but I think room by room and don't fall into
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:37.880]   the trap of starting minimizing possessions by going to the hardest room that you'll ever
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.240]   have to complete.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.660]   Because a lot of people hear about decluttering and they're like that's right, I got to go
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.940]   through my garage, I got to go through my attic or the basement.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.060]   And then you go spend an hour and a half in the basement and you don't see any progress
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.460]   at the end of the day and you feel frustrated, kind of throw up your hands and give up this
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.540]   is never going to work for me.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:06.300]   But you could go spend 15 minutes in your car and like totally change the inside of
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.460]   your car the very next time you get in it.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.280]   Or you could spend an hour and a half in your living room or your bedroom or your bathroom
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:23.240]   and you could notice a change by the end of the day and that just - that mental movement
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.460]   of seeing progress and seeing that you're making changes then motivates you to go tackle
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.620]   the next space and the next space and the next space.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.380]   So, easiest to hardest, most lived in areas first and by that I mean don't - like maybe
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.060]   the guest bedroom is the easiest thing for you to declutter in your home but you're never
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.900]   in the guest bedroom, so you never see the progress, you never feel like you're making
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900]   any changes.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.380]   So, I would tell people to go start in their car, just take everything out of your car
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.660]   that you don't need and the next time you get in your car, see how it makes you feel.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.420]   I can guarantee you'll love it a lot more than having the empty water bottle rolling
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.820]   around in the back seat the whole time.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:10.580]   Has any of the changes in the last few years from the pandemic and working from home changed
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.580]   any perspectives you had on, you know, your home and what you should do and how you should
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.740]   think about it now that lots of people ended up working from home and maybe some will forever?
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:31.400]   My overriding thought of going into the pandemic back two years ago now was I'm glad I found
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.660]   minimalism 12 years ago.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:43.040]   Like I'm glad that I had done the work of creating a home that was calm and peaceful,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.220]   a home that I wanted to be in, a home that wasn't adding stress to my life.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:56.020]   Not to mention, I felt like I had saved a lot of money by pursuing minimalism and buying
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:05.580]   less stuff, I felt freer, I felt less tied down to the place that I was confined to be
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   in.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.260]   And I think some people early on were like "Boy, I bet you're regretting becoming a minimalist
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.380]   now that you're stuck inside your home" and I'm like "No, just the opposite".
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.220]   Like I feel free, like I feel like we could get up and move if we needed to.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.700]   I felt like I had saved up some money along the ways.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.420]   It's not that my home is empty, there's still things to do in my home and I thought I brought
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.100]   a lot of intentionality into my life over the last 10 years about how I spent my time
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.580]   and certainly, I think the pandemic upended a lot of that in a lot of ways and a lot of
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:48.260]   unhealthy habits that emerged, but I thought that I was in a much better place to handle
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:55.820]   those and overcome them once the world slowly opened back up again.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.580]   You mentioned you started this a little over a decade ago.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:05.020]   So, were you always just the kind of person who didn't care about stuff and had your garage
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.740]   was empty, you didn't buy stuff all the time and that this was easy or how was the transition
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.440]   for you at the kind of genesis of your approach to minimalism?
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.980]   It wasn't something that I started out doing, I've been married 10 years, my son was five
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.940]   and my daughter was two at the time where I was introduced to minimalism.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.020]   Pretty typical middle-class suburban lifestyle.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.180]   I always tell the story how we had gotten three pretty significant pay increases over
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.540]   those first 10 years of marriage and yet, for some reason, we're never able to get ahead
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.460]   financially.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:52.420]   It always seemed like, well, now that I got that pay raise, I should be able to save everything
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.460]   new that was coming into my life, but it just had never worked out that way.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.180]   It seemed like the more money came in, the more money went out.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.460]   And then it wasn't until - yeah, my son was five, my daughter was two and literally on
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:14.300]   a Saturday morning, we were living in Vermont at the time and just our typical spring cleaning,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.740]   I went out to clean the garage and it ended up just taking hours of organizing stuff and
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.660]   getting rid of stuff and cleaning things out and my son was in the backyard asking me to
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.220]   come play and I kept pushing him off.
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.100]   It's like just this constant "no, no, one more minute, I'm almost done, I'm almost done,
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.060]   we'll play, we'll play as soon as I'm done" and it was my neighbor who introduced me to
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.220]   minimalism as I think I was complaining a little bit about how much effort had gone
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.980]   into the garage and she says "you know, that's why my daughter's a minimalist, she keeps
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:55.340]   telling me I don't need to own all this stuff" and yeah, looking at the pile of things in
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:01.340]   my driveway and there's my son swinging alone on the swing set in the backyard and suddenly
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:09.500]   realized all the things I owned weren't making me happy which we would all say but even more,
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.720]   all those things were distracting me and taking me away from the thing that did bring me happiness
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:21.780]   and joy and meaning and life and so, that was it and as far as the - like was it difficult
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.060]   for me?
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.420]   No, it wasn't.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.820]   Like I saw the bigger picture right away, I could see pretty clearly how owning less
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:37.980]   stuff would free me up to invest my life in things that actually matter so, certainly
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.220]   there were - it took about six or nine months so, there was certainly effort that had to
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:49.580]   go into it and tough decisions that needed to be made but I certainly wasn't drug into
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.660]   the lifestyle kicking and screaming, I was pretty excited about the opportunity right
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   away.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.020]   I imagine most people listening are thinking "I'm on board, you know, I've already thought
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.400]   for the last 10 minutes about what my why is" but I feel like when the rubber hits the
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.700]   road and you're like "Okay, now I got to start getting rid of things", I can already run
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.580]   through my head the story I'd have for almost everything that I probably should get rid
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.780]   of and haven't and in my particular life, there's one thing that between my wife and
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.780]   I is like this.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:26.920]   She's much more the "Throw everything away" or "Give it away" or "We don't need this"
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.320]   and I have maybe a common attitude of like "Well, one day, what if we want this thing?"
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.500]   And the one that comes to mind every time is someone gave us a raclette, just like a
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.000]   little grill on the top and it heats up cheese and you'd use it when you have your friends
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.340]   over for dinner and we have this thing and in 10 years, we've maybe used it once and
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.140]   she would make the argument "If we don't use this more than that, it's got to go" and I'm
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.260]   like "Well, like we have the room in the house and maybe one day we'll need it".
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.620]   I'm going to be really bummed when I say "We should do this one time and we don't have
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.620]   it, then what do I do?
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.620]   Do I buy it?
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   You can't really rent it".
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.680]   What do you do when you have a conversation with someone and they bring - I imagine I'm
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.460]   not the only person that has this challenge of like "Ah, I might want this thing one day,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.580]   so I shouldn't get rid of it".
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:19.340]   Well, this specific one, heating up cheese, you are the first one ever, by the way.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.740]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.920]   There's no other way to heat up cheese except for this one little tool.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.000]   It's a device you would put on the table to eat with people and cook food together versus
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.300]   something you'd use in the pantry, but it could very easily be a fondue set.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.780]   So we can pretend it's a fondue set.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.780]   Got it.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.780]   Got it.
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.780]   Got it.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:56.820]   So this would be a classic example of "I'm in for owning less and my mind races to the
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:02.420]   hardest thing in my home that I would ever have to get rid of".
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:08.460]   And I don't want to shirk the responsibility of this question here, but honestly, what
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.900]   I would tell you, what I would tell anyone else is I would say "Don't start by getting
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.660]   rid of the hardest thing in your home that you would ever have to get rid of".
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:26.820]   Like I just did an interview earlier with someone who had like a Pringles can that they
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.560]   got from their grandfather who taught them how to invest money and this was where he
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   saved his money.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.940]   And I'm like "Well, you don't start by getting rid of the Pringles can, like let's just find
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:44.100]   some things in your home that you know you don't need, you know you don't use.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.860]   Maybe you have duplicates of the item, maybe you have something else that could accomplish
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.880]   the exact same thing, maybe it's something that was from a different season of life that
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.340]   you no longer use anymore.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:03.220]   Let's find easier wins, let's make quicker progress and then start noticing how owning
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:08.300]   less frees up your life for bigger and better things.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:15.420]   And just notice the change that's taking place in what happens when you walk in your home,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.740]   how much less time you have to spend cleaning or organizing, how much money you're saving
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:28.260]   by not buying stuff that you don't need, how much more life is enjoyable when everything
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:34.500]   you own is your favorite of something rather than you know, a closet full of clothes that
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.700]   you only wear 20% of them anyway.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:46.220]   Like start noticing some of those benefits and then when you get to the fondue set, like
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:53.620]   you'll be in a better place and maybe you've decluttered a lot more and now having people
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.540]   over is something that's becoming more important to you and your home is cleaner and so, it's
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.980]   easier to do and you're like "no, this is something that's going to be - you know, this
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.100]   is something that showing hospitality and having people over is an important value to
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.420]   us and this fondue set allows us to do that".
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.820]   And so, you're going to keep it or maybe you're going to be like "you know what?
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.900]   This is kind of stupid that I was holding on to this thing and now that I think about
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.140]   it, I do have a friend and I could borrow his if I desperately needed it at some point
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.660]   in the future".
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.320]   What you just said about borrowing something comes to mind with the most common objection
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.100]   I would think of going through my house.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:37.540]   There are a lot of things that I don't actually have like an attachment to, but I think in
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.460]   the back of my mind, "Well, one day what if I need this thing?
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   Basketball.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.460]   I own a basketball.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.180]   I don't play basketball a lot, but I know there's a park down the street with a basketball.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.660]   If I wanted to play basketball one day, I don't really want to go buy a basketball.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.980]   So, what about when it's not that it's an emotional attachment, it's not a hard thing
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.180]   to get rid of, but it's just something that you think "Well, one day I might need this
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.260]   and I don't want to buy it then, so I want to keep it".
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.880]   One option you just gave, which is maybe someone you know has one to borrow.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.940]   Is there anything else to help people get over that hurdle of "I might need this someday"?
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.060]   I mean, there's just some math that we can do in our heads.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.060]   What are the probabilities of me needing a basketball?
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.460]   How hard would it be to replace?
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.380]   How much really would it cost if I needed to replace it?
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.620]   What is my financial situation if that was required?
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.740]   I often think that there's - the question we typically ask ourselves is "Yeah, but what
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.100]   if I need it someday?"
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:47.420]   And I always think there's another side to that question, and the other side of that
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:54.660]   question is "What if I hold on to everything for the rest of my life and never end up using
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   it?"
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:02.980]   Like there's more than just a financial cost to the things that we buy and the things that
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.980]   we own.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.960]   Like everything we own takes up physical space in our home and it takes up mental space in
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.540]   our mind and it's - Randy Alcorn says "Every increased possession adds increased anxiety
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.540]   onto our lives".
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:20.060]   Even it's just like a little bit in the back of your head "Oh yeah, I've got that basketball.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.300]   I got to decide what I'm going to do with it at some point".
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:34.340]   You know, once we start making these changes, maybe there's some kid down the street who
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:39.740]   could be using that basketball every single day if he just knew that there was one out
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.100]   there.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.740]   And so, there's a cost to holding on to things that we don't always consider.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.580]   I'll share a story that goes in the positive for my clutter lifestyle, which I wouldn't
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.480]   say I have necessarily, but we got rid of a lot of stuff when we moved.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.380]   And we moved into a house that had a lot of storage in the garage and we realized we maybe
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.160]   didn't need all of it.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.740]   And so, by getting rid of a lot of the storage in the garage, we thought "Wow, we actually
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.540]   have enough room here that we could put a spin bike in the garage and now we could exercise
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.540]   more".
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.300]   And so, for us, getting rid of some stuff enabled us to use the space differently.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.660]   We could actually have a - in a weird way, it almost gave us an extra room in our house.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.880]   So I'll just share that as something that, for us, worked to our advantage to getting
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   rid of stuff.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.660]   Now, do I have a ways to go, I'm sure.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.820]   I think another struggle I come to and I know you have a perspective on this is "Gosh, I
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.480]   have this thing.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.300]   I could probably sell this thing on eBay and it's worth more than zero.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.000]   So I should probably make sure that I sell it, but the overhead and actually selling
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.460]   something is really high and I don't want to go hire someone at a sell it again store
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.100]   because now they're going to take 20% and I'm perfectly capable.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:03.940]   And so 6 years later, I still have this iPhone that used to be worth $50 more, I guess now
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.940]   is worth $50.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.820]   It used to be worth a few hundred dollars and had I just either given it away or sold
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.140]   it at the time, it would have been a better outcome.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.940]   But the overhead of dealing with it meant that it just piled up.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.180]   So the desire to sell something and make a little bit of extra money seems to always
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.020]   hold me back from just giving it away or getting rid of it.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:29.100]   How do you think about that decision to give something away versus try to sell it?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.500]   Generosity brings benefits into our lives that money doesn't.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:43.020]   And if the question is, should I be donating all these things or should I be trying to
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.380]   sell everything?
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:54.900]   My advice is unless you desperately need the money, just donate the stuff.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.580]   Find a local charity that you believe in.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:03.380]   Find a local charity that's supporting a problem that you want to solve in the world, if it's
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:11.820]   homelessness or refugee resettlement or a battered women's clinic or foster care, foster
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.860]   children in the system.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.820]   I think that there's a benefit that comes to just donating some of that stuff.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:27.340]   Not personally, not even to mention how much - if you're trying to declutter a lot of stuff,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:35.760]   then selling everything just adds time and energy and stress to an already pretty difficult
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:43.500]   process and we don't typically make nearly as much money as we think we're going to.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.420]   And so, you know, there's a time and a space if you're getting rid of something really
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:53.280]   valuable or something really big and you don't have a truck to haul it away, like there's
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:00.100]   a time and a space I suppose for trying to resell some things on a selective basis.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:05.420]   But most people, if you don't desperately need the money already, I think it's better
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   just to donate.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:16.160]   I actually find that when you start donating things, it tends to almost prompt more and
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.780]   more minimizing of things as opposed to trying to sell it.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.740]   So, like when we started, my son was five, my daughter was two, we were done having children
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:35.780]   and so - but we had a basement full of maternity clothes and like baby things and crib and
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.500]   a high chair, like stuff that my daughter had just outgrown.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:47.380]   And I remember we tried to sell it at a garage sale and like hardly any of it sold.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:53.860]   And so, I called my neighbor who I knew worked at the Care Net Pregnancy Center in Burlington,
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.020]   Vermont, just down the road from us.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.980]   And I'm like, "Hey, we have all this baby stuff, I was just going to take it to Goodwill,
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.260]   but like, is this stuff that you could use?"
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.980]   And I remember, like I'll never forget it, she's like, "Yeah, we can use that, that's
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.700]   exactly what we do.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:18.340]   Like we work with families in poverty, we work with single mothers and we give them
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:25.660]   maternity clothes, baby clothes, high chairs, cribs, bottles, blankets, like the whole deal".
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.700]   And I was like, "Man, I don't - I guess I never knew what you did or I never knew how
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.820]   much of a need there was in the community".
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.220]   And like we went into our basement and we found more boxes of stuff that we didn't need.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.780]   And we're like, "Man, if there's someone in the community that can be using this stuff
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.820]   like right now, why in the world would we let it just collect dust in our basement?"
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:54.620]   So, I think generosity and donating can even prompt - help us to get rid of even more and
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.620]   more.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.820]   If anyone listening has probably already heard me talk about the book Happy Money, which
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.260]   it now turns out I learned there are two.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.100]   So, the one by Elizabeth Dunn, one of the five things that I guess science has shown
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:11.820]   that at least this is spending money on, but I think the principles apply is spending money
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.700]   on others and giving money away.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.020]   So, certainly the same principle I think would apply to things.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.880]   What are the other four?
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.820]   Because I always just list three things that science says we can spend our money on to
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.820]   make us happy.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.820]   But do you remember?
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.380]   I shouldn't be putting you on the spot.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   No, no.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.140]   So, one is making something a treat.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.940]   So, these aren't necessarily - there are ways that you can spend money.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.420]   So, one is making things a treat.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.300]   So, if you buy a latte every day, maybe consider buying the latte once a month or buying it
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.580]   once a week to make it a surprise.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.300]   One is pre-paying for things.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.780]   It's kind of like pay now, consume later.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.300]   If you're going on a vacation, see if you can call the hotel and pay for the entire
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:59.580]   stay in advance so that when you end your hotel stay, your final experience isn't looking
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.340]   at this bill that was a few thousand dollars.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   I said invest in others.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   This is fun.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.180]   I love being put on the spot.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.180]   One is buying time.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.140]   So, if there's a thing you don't love, if you hate cleaning your house, spend money.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.540]   Imagine that's one that you've done.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.060]   And then the last is probably one we've all heard, which is buying experiences.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.300]   I had the bottom three.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.780]   Whenever I talk about the three ways you can spend money that increase happiness, experiences
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:27.420]   over possessions, buying time, and being generous with our money, but I hadn't heard the first
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.420]   two.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   Yeah, the other two.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.060]   Pay now, consume later, and make it a treat.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   Alright.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   Got it.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.860]   So, those are a lot of the roadblocks.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.660]   And I appreciate talking through them because I imagine a lot of people have come to this
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.660]   conclusion.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.540]   There's one thing I want to ask about, which is interesting because we're having another
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.300]   child in a few months.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:50.700]   And we were thinking about a trade-off here, which is time is of the essence, right?
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.780]   We just talked about spending money on time is a good use of money.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.260]   But one of the things that takes up a lot of time when you have a child is there's just
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.500]   all these...
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.380]   Things get dirty all the time.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.940]   Burp claws, bibs.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.620]   So we went through this conversation at lunch today in advance of having this conversation.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:14.220]   And we're like, "Gosh, our instinct was let's overbuy the bibs so we can underspend time
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.100]   on laundry.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.720]   But you could make a case that we could buy three or four bibs and wash them.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.020]   Or we could buy 20 and do laundry once a week.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.160]   How do you juxtapose...
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.980]   You just said you recommend spending money on things to buy time, but you also like owning
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.420]   fewer things.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.020]   Does the temporal nature of something like a burp cloth that you might only need for
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.820]   a year have a carve-out in the need for owning fewer possessions?
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.340]   Oh, that would be an interesting one.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.420]   I don't know.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:50.580]   I don't know how you'll know until you're actually in it.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.580]   It's something...
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.700]   What is enough?
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.060]   I get asked everything.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.860]   How much underwear should I own?
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.940]   How many pairs of shoes should I own?
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.020]   How many towels should I have in my home?
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.620]   I get asked how many square footage should I have in my home?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.380]   I get asked everything.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:18.620]   And the answer is, you really just need to experiment in your home to find out what is
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.060]   going to work best for you.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:29.020]   My hope with possessions or my goal with possessions is that my possessions are not a burden to
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.980]   me, whether in too few or in too many.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.500]   And most of us live with more possessions than we need.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.780]   And so, it has become a burden to us and a distraction from things that matter.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:49.420]   But there is the case that you could have too few of something and it also becomes burdensome
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:56.620]   if I have to visit a laundromat and I got to go there every two days, then at that point,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.620]   it's becoming more of a burden to have fewer burp claws or fewer clothes than it would
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.780]   be to have a week's worth that fit into one wash.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:13.100]   So I suppose I could make the case that, yeah, we're not going to use burp claws for that
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:18.260]   long and I don't know, can you donate burp claws?
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.780]   Probably I suppose if they're clean.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:29.380]   So I don't know, I love the - what is the normal laundry routine in your family?
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.380]   How often do you do laundry?
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.460]   Is it once a week?
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:38.380]   Then what's going up once you add a new human into the family?
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.620]   But or at least there's going to be more of it.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.660]   But you know, what makes sense?
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.420]   What gets us through one cycle?
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.860]   I know there are a lot of trends in kind of minimalism and everything, you know, a lot
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.500]   of people in the past few years have talked about Marie Kondo, you know, only keep things
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.220]   that spark joy.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.780]   Are a lot of these different things, do they work together?
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.420]   Are they different paths, different sex you have to pick one to follow?
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.420]   Can you mix and match?
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   Do you have favorites?
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.900]   How do you think about all that's going on in the kind of broader space?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:19.060]   I think we're all having a similar conversation, but getting there a different way.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:27.460]   I tend to like the questions that I have people ask and the approach that I have people go.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:33.540]   I tend to think, you know, what is my purpose in life and do these possessions help me do
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.540]   that?
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.980]   Or are they distracting me from it?
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:42.940]   I tend to think that's a better long-term question than does this item spark joy in
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.980]   the present moment or not?
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:52.520]   But that being said, I'm for, like I've said this before, I'm for anyone who can help people
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.940]   own less stuff.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:00.380]   And if does it spark joy is the question that allows me to start making progress in my home
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.940]   or Marie is very much category by category as opposed to room by room.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.940]   And if that works for you, then I think go for it.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.120]   I tend to think that the way I encourage people to do it tends to work a little bit better,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.980]   but I think different people can do it in different ways.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   And there's different - I think generally we're all talking about owning just the things
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:27.620]   you need to own to live your life the best way that you possibly can.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:34.180]   Clearly what that looks like in the end differs from person to person, but that's fine.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.900]   We're all coming at it from different viewpoints and we're all different people trying to do
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   it anyway.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.740]   Are there a few examples of the question you like to ask and particular items that you've
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.060]   talked to people about that kind of might bring an example to light for people?
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.300]   The questions that I have people ask, number one, do I need it?
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.660]   Which is pretty common.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.460]   Number two, why do I have it?
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.300]   Number three, do I have - what would I use if I didn't have it?
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.980]   Tends to be very helpful.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:14.200]   The overarching philosophy for me is, does this item help me fulfill my purpose?
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.900]   Like what are my greatest goals in life?
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.100]   Who do I want to be?
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.240]   What do I want to do?
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.000]   What are my values?
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.740]   And then what things do I need to own to help me accomplish those values and accomplish
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.460]   those goals?
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.260]   And what are the things that are keeping me from it?
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.240]   And I learned it really early on.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:44.300]   There's a couple up in Portland called - named Logan and Tammy Strobel, and they had moved
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.780]   out of their home into a tiny home and there were two of them and they just had two plates
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.220]   and they had two cups and two forks and like a hundred things between them.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:59.740]   Meanwhile, we were a family of four and we lived in the suburbs of Vermont.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:07.060]   I was working at a church at the time and like we loved having people over for dinner.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.540]   I was doing like weddings and so, we'd have like the future newlyweds over, not just to
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.380]   plan the wedding but to talk about marriage and how to make it successful and we would
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.800]   always have dinner.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.160]   And so, I remember looking at the plates and the cups and the forks and remembering Logan
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.100]   and Tammy just owned two, I'm like "well, we're a family of four, we need four".
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:37.760]   But also having people over is pretty important to us and something that we want to do even
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.940]   more of, not less of and so, it became "well, let's keep eight plates and let's keep eight
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.220]   forks and let's keep eight coffee mugs".
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.860]   You don't need three or four sets of eight plates and eight coffee mugs but if this is
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.500]   something that we're going to do more of, then certainly we need to have the things
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.980]   in place to accomplish that more.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.460]   Were there a few hard items where you kind of got on the fence about "gosh, this one
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.540]   I don't know" that maybe went the other way?
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.220]   I learned a lot about clothes, like really changed the way I dress.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:18.660]   I tend to wear the same thing every single day now, V-neck t-shirt and pants and I never
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.980]   imagined going into this that I would wear the same thing every single day.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.220]   But now that I do, I love it and would never go back to having to decide every morning
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:33.260]   what to wear because it's just one less decision that I have to make.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.740]   I feel like I could do that and probably do, I think my wife would struggle with that a
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   lot more.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:45.540]   I think that's - you know, I learned it from a lady, Courtney Carver.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:50.900]   She writes at bemorewithless.com and she lives in Salt Lake City and I learned that whole
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.540]   idea from her.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:58.420]   So, I hear a lot of "well, that's easy for you because you're a guy" and I always respond
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.820]   "yeah, but I learned it from a woman".
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.860]   So, that's always my approach.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.460]   Different personalities look at it different ways.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.340]   So I want to move on to your new book, you know, which came out, I think by the time
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.020]   this comes out will be last week, "Things That Matter" and you wrote it to help people
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.420]   overcome distractions.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:26.260]   How do you think all of the work you did in minimalism and all the learnings you had kind
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.980]   of brought you to this moment?
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.020]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:37.700]   That's a super helpful question because that - minimizing possessions was what sparked
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:44.700]   this thinking of "hey, how did - like how did my home fill up with all these things?
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.900]   Like why did I have boxes full of stuff that I didn't need?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.980]   Why did I have minivan loads full of things that I could take to Goodwill or the pregnancy
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   center?"
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:39:01.700]   I certainly never set out to just spend my life buying a bunch of stuff that I didn't
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   need.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.420]   So, how did this happen?
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.380]   And like it just struck me that I was just living a pretty unintentional life.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.260]   I never would have said my goal was to own a whole bunch of stuff, but that's how I was
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.340]   living and that's what I was thinking about and that's what I was doing.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:23.460]   And so, I started owning less stuff and seeing how that freed me up to focus more on things
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:29.820]   that actually mattered and it occurred to me that possessions, that physical things
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:36.600]   aren't the only distraction that can slowly creep into our lives and things that very
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:45.660]   subtly begin to shape the way we live or become the things that motivate us rather than longer
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.100]   lasting pursuits.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:53.760]   And so, the book lists out eight distractions that keep people from things that matter.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.940]   And ultimately, I think that we get to the end of our lives and kind of regret some of
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.540]   the decisions that we made.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.600]   So, how do we overcome that regret?
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.860]   How do we get to the end of our lives feeling the most satisfied and the most fulfilled?
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:14.080]   And I think we do that by identifying what is most important and then by daily removing
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.160]   any distractions that keep us from it.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.400]   You highlight eight distractions.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   I don't think...
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   There's an entire book that I would highly recommend anyone listening go and read to
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.200]   dig into those eight distractions.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.460]   But could we kind of run through at a high level what they are so people can get a sense
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.760]   of kind of ones that might resonate with them and kind of inspire them to want to go pick
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.520]   up the book and start with the chapter there?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.720]   Let me give you the eight distractions that I cover in the book.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.480]   Each is a listing of the distraction and then how we begin to overcome them.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.880]   Not that there's a three-step approach to overcoming all these things.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.140]   These are lifelong pursuits in a lot of ways, but let me give you the eight and then I'm
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.640]   happy to talk about any one that you want as in-depth as you want.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:11.440]   So, the distractions are fear, past mistakes, happiness, money, possessions, accolades,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   leisure and tech.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.440]   Those are the eight.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   Or trivial.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:22.720]   I like to say trivial more than tech, but same thing.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:28.000]   And is there one that's, you know, maybe it's the most important one to think about or if
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.880]   you looked at them and said, "God, I have a little bit of all of these I should tackle
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.920]   first as one to try to kind of overcome"?
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.720]   I think that probably we all have each of these some degree or another.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:48.840]   We did a survey, a nationwide survey for the book and probably the most, I would say the
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:42:00.920]   most heartbreaking response that we got back was 60% of people say that they are held back
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:07.640]   from the future they want because of past mistakes they've committed in their life and
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:14.400]   56% of people say that they are held back from the future they want because of a past
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.720]   mistake committed against them.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.880]   And yeah, that was like almost - it really shook me.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.440]   I was pretty emotional when I saw that.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.280]   And that's just the people who wouldn't recognize it and articulate it, but like that is a lot
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:39.480]   of potential that is being bottled up because of a mistake.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:45.640]   And for someone to live their whole life, like 60% of us would like - we'd say it out
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.800]   loud that "I can't live the future I want because of something that I did in the past
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.240]   or something that was done to me in the past".
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.640]   And so, that's always a big one that I think comes to mind.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.680]   Money is a huge one, 80%.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.640]   Over 80% of us think we'll be happier if we have more money and 77% of us say that our
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.040]   desire for money affects our decisions every single day.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:24.560]   And not that - you know, money has a role in our lives but when the desire for money
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:32.000]   becomes the thing that dictates our decisions, this is when I think we get to the end and
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.200]   we're like "What did I waste my life for?"
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:40.120]   Like I spent my whole life always needing more and more money all the time when in reality,
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.260]   I had enough to live the life that I needed and could have been living instead.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.480]   We talk a lot about money on the show, so I'd love to dig in a little bit there and
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.700]   say I imagine a lot of people resonate with that.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.640]   My wife and I have this conversation all the time.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.780]   It's like "Oh, you know, we got to get to this milestone or this milestone".
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.620]   And as we think about it, we reflect and say "Well, maybe we don't".
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.960]   And it's easier to say "You know what?
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.380]   Maybe money's not going to actually make us happier and maybe we don't need that milestone".
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.120]   But that doesn't always change how you feel in the moment of seeing something or wanting
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.160]   something or hearing your friends talk in a certain way.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.880]   So how do you go to that next step of "I've acknowledged that maybe money isn't the end
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.920]   all most important thing to my happiness, but it still kind of gives me angst or kind
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.160]   of distracts me"?
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.920]   90% of Americans say that they have financial-related stress.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:42.880]   This is probably the stat that like really sent me down this road when I read that 90%
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:49.200]   of us have financial-related stress and I'm like "We're the wealthiest nation in the history
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   of the world.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.240]   Why are 90% of us stressed about money?
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.760]   It's not because we don't have food, it's not because we don't have shelter, it's not
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.320]   because we don't have clothing".
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:07.040]   Like certainly some of us don't have those things, but not 90% of us.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:14.120]   And so, I started wondering like "Why is it that we're constantly stressed about money?"
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:22.240]   And I've just come to the conclusion that it's because we keep expecting money to provide
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.160]   something that it's never going to provide.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:32.080]   If we think more money is going to make us happy or that we're finally going to feel
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:40.040]   secure with how much money we have and we get this number in our head of "Okay, once
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.920]   I reach a million dollars or once I start making $60,000 a year or $100,000".
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.620]   Like we get this picture in our head of how much we need, how much we think people who
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:58.240]   make that money are happy or feel secure and then we get there and we don't feel secure
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:06.940]   and we don't feel happier, then the thinking never becomes "Hey, maybe I'm just not going
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.800]   to find security and happiness in money".
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:18.200]   Instead the thinking becomes "I just had the wrong number and actually I need this much
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:24.680]   money or I need to be making that much money and then I'll finally feel satisfied or secure
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.280]   or happy".
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:33.580]   87% of millionaires say that they are not wealthy.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:41.100]   And so, the reality is that we need to realize that we're not going to find those things
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.160]   in money.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:49.280]   And then man, Harvard did this just fascinating study, 100,000 people I think they did in
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.120]   this study and they were like trying to figure out finally does money bring happiness.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:00.520]   Like there's all these debates of "Oh, $50,000 a year or $75,000 a year or money never really
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.120]   brings happiness", like what - how do we solve this whole thing?
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:14.200]   And they came to the conclusion after interviewing 100,000 people that really the thing that
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:20.960]   trips us up is when money becomes the priority in our lives.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:28.480]   Or more specifically, when we start sacrificing time for money or when we start sacrificing
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.800]   other things that are important to us for the sake of making more money, that this is
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.540]   when life satisfaction really begins to drop.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:47.960]   And so, coming to the conclusion that "Hey, I have enough money coming in to support my
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.920]   needs, I don't have to spend every day or I don't have to spend my entire life constantly
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:59.960]   wanting or pursuing more and more and more, but I have enough to meet my needs and my
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:07.680]   life would be much better served investing my time into other things that actually matter".
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.360]   I'm not sure if that answered your question, but I got to say a lot of the things that
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   I like to say.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.920]   No, no, I think it's helpful because it's not - if you had just a magical thing that
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.320]   said, "Oh, you know, if you've decided you don't want to keep up with the Joneses and
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.680]   you're struggling, drink three Diet Cokes and you'll be fine."
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.120]   There's not a magical thing you can just start doing all of a sudden to make it go away.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.880]   And it sounds like it's really more a process of having a conversation, whether it's with
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.840]   yourself, your partner, your family, but there's no magic bullet to stop wanting more money
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.160]   as much as there is a conversation you need to keep thinking about.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.320]   I can give you a bullet, give some money away, start giving money away.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:57.920]   Give away $100, give away $50, give away $10, I don't know whatever it is.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:04.040]   Give something away or give away a little bit more than you already do and do it every
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:12.140]   single week and find out if you still have food and you still have shelter and you still
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.560]   have clothing and you will.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:23.080]   And the greatest benefit of generosity, I think, to ourselves is that we realize that
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:32.000]   we already have enough, that I can give away $50 a week, I don't know, we're all indifferent.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.320]   If someone's really struggling, just $5 a week, like just give away $5 a week.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:42.360]   And when you realize that you've given away $5 a week, every week for two months and you
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:51.100]   still have food and you still have shelter, then we realize, okay, not only do I have
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:58.100]   enough money coming in, but I have so much money that I can actually give some away to
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.700]   someone else who needs it.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:09.440]   And I think this then begins to reframe not just how much money we need, but just the
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:17.860]   joy that comes from helping someone that's in need, from finding a problem in the world
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.020]   that we want to solve and not just thinking about it, but actually being a part of the
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.180]   solution, even if it's just to a small degree.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:32.660]   I think this is how we begin to reshape this constant need for money all the time.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:38.980]   We recently had Adam Nash, who started a company called Daffy, which is a donor advised fund.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.220]   But one of the coolest things is they allow you to...
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.940]   You could just basically give money on a recurring basis.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.500]   And you can give it...
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.580]   They try to separate the idea of where you're giving it from just giving it so you can get
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.020]   in the habit of being charitable, which I personally really, really like.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:51:00.340]   You talked a lot about in the book about being generous and how generosity helps and how
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.700]   acts of service help towards focusing on things that matter.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:10.580]   Are there things other than giving that can kind of help focus less on yourself and more
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   on others?
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.860]   Getting out and doing something.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:19.880]   Getting dirt under your fingernails is what I say in the book.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:25.860]   Stop just reading about problems in the world and give something to it or get out and do
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.100]   something concerning it.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:34.960]   Really, it's a whole - but you could even take it beyond this.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:44.600]   It's just a whole mindset of even going to work on any given day.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.360]   What is my goal for the day ahead of me?
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:58.040]   If my goal for the day ahead of me is I need to earn the raise or I need to get noticed
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.960]   by the boss so that I can receive the praise or the accolades.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.400]   If every day at work is all about what can I get out of this, that's a completely different
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:16.420]   way to approach work than "Hey, how can I just bring benefit to the people around me?
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.920]   Who can I help today?
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.340]   Who could I serve today?
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.800]   Who could I invest into today?"
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.600]   Not because of something that I'm going to get out of it, but just because it makes the
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.860]   world a better place by giving or serving or helping.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.800]   It's just a very different way to approach life.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   I love it.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.420]   So, I want to get to the last distraction you had which was around technology or I think
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:48.920]   you said earlier, "Trivial things" is that your rephrase of it.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.400]   Let's talk about that a little because I think technology and the internet and our phones
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.000]   have really become a distraction.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   I did a whole episode with Nir Eyal, who wrote this book about becoming indistractable.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.240]   So we don't necessarily need to go down the "How do you notice in the moment that you're
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:12.840]   about to use your phone?" and maybe not do that so you can spend time with your family.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:18.540]   But how is technology preventing us from finding our purpose, from finding the things we care
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.980]   about and/or as you say, the things that matter?
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:28.300]   I like to use the word "the trivial" because we're here today because of technology.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.460]   Technology in and of itself isn't the distraction.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:36.060]   I get to do what I do every single day because of technology and we get to be talking to
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.260]   people all around the world because of technology.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.420]   So there's plenty of good to it.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:49.140]   It's just when we become mindless, when we're not - I try to separate like "Am I using technology
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:56.500]   to create good into the world or am I just being used by technology for whatever the
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.820]   platform or app is trying to do?"
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:06.420]   So am I creating something or am I scrolling mindlessly or playing a video game or binging
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.740]   another season of whatever it might be?
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.100]   That's like - I think that's what becomes the distraction.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:18.340]   So I think it's important to remember that this distraction of the trivial isn't necessarily
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.100]   new.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:27.500]   I can remember even reading from ancient Rome, like the arguments of not going to the Colosseum
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:32.700]   because it was a waste of time from things that actually matter and things that are more
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   important.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:39.380]   I remember we had the same conversation when television started or radio or even books
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.100]   probably to some extent.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:50.300]   Like there's always been that distraction of less important things, the urgent tyranny
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.180]   of the urgent, I think as someone once called it.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:03.980]   But yeah, our tech is certainly much more available than it was ever before and certainly
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:11.900]   around us all the time and I just think the way we think about technology and trying to
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:20.660]   recognize that "Hey, I can use this for good or I can be used by it" and to separate creation
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:27.420]   from consumption online and start to notice "Am I using this to serve my purpose or am
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.980]   I being used by it?"
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:35.780]   You do mention the concept of taking a digital detox if you feel technology is kind of coming
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.700]   on strong.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.420]   Are there things people should think about when that's kind of relevant or when it might
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.900]   make sense and what is it?
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.300]   I recommend it for everybody.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:51.060]   I think everybody, certainly anyone who's around technology and feels like it's becoming
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:55.100]   a distraction in their life to take some time away.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.940]   Take 30 days, take 29 days.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.900]   For me, I've done 40 days different times or a couple of weeks.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:13.900]   But pretty much every year, I try to get away because it just helps us understand, I think,
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:21.460]   how much time we were wasting on some of that stuff and then when we return it back to our
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.180]   lives and re-engage it, we do it in a much more intentional way.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:31.620]   Like what did I really miss about being away from social media or what did I really miss
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:38.060]   about what apps actually were helpful on my phone and which ones were just distractions
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:42.260]   and so, I really think it's the way to reorient.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.020]   It's certainly the - I think a pretty important first step for people.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:53.940]   I'm all for, you know, take all the apps off your home screen or wrap a rubber band around
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:54.940]   your phone.
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:57:00.520]   Like I'm all in for different hacks and stuff, but really the work that we need to do is
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:06.180]   reorient entirely and I think taking a month away.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:11.060]   The summer I think is the best time that you can do that, unless you live in Phoenix like
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.340]   I do everywhere else.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.660]   It's pretty nice.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:18.180]   Take a month and don't watch any television for a month.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:22.900]   Don't use your phone except for anything but phone and text and your email when you're
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:29.020]   at work and just do it for a month and see how it makes you feel and what you notice
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:33.220]   and what you missed and what was actually essential and what wasn't.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.220]   Wow.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.460]   For someone who kind of lives multiple jobs on the internet, it seems impossible.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:42.420]   But I will - I sometimes commit to on the spot to things.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.180]   I committed to a month of cold showers in an interview.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.780]   I am not going to commit to 21 days on the spot, but I will commit to thinking about
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.780]   it.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   There you go.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.780]   There you go.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.200]   So one thing before we wrap that I'm going to ask is I try to ask everyone for wherever
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.980]   they are in the world or a city they know well to give everyone some recommendations,
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:06.420]   maybe for their summer travels if they end up in that place for, you know, where you
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:11.980]   think they should get a bite to eat or have dinner, meet a friend for a drink or a coffee
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.100]   and something they should do.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:19.220]   You can pick any city you want and I'd love to hear those three things.
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.880]   I forget the three things, but because the whole time I was thinking we probably shouldn't
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:29.780]   come to Phoenix in the summer, but no, if you're in Phoenix, which you should totally
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:34.420]   come to, but maybe just not in June, July or August.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:41.220]   There's a little Mexican place called Barrio Cafe and I would send people there.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.500]   It's a great little Mexican place.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.820]   Probably going to be a long line to get a seat at the table, but it's well worth it.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:50.860]   Barrio Cafe.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.140]   You got to go hiking when you're in Phoenix.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.940]   Hike up Camelback Mountain and there's two routes up Camelback Mountain.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:05.540]   There's a really strenuous one that literally has you climbing up boulders and then there's
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.260]   a much more peaceful one.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:11.820]   But that's the hike to do if you're going to be in Phoenix.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.820]   That's great.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.000]   I will put that on the list.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.060]   And before we wrap, we've talked about the book a few times, Things That Matter.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.860]   I definitely think people listening should check it out.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.860]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're up to online and get in touch?
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.900]   It's Things That Matter, Overcoming Distraction to Pursue a More Meaningful Life.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.240]   You can find it everywhere.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:38.280]   My home base is BecomingMinimalist.com and so you can - anything and everything I do
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.500]   runs through there.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:46.520]   I should be doing a speaking tour through what I'm calling the Midwest from Omaha and
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:53.600]   Chicago, Nashville, Louisville, Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, all the way over to Austin.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:58.780]   So I'll be doing that this summer so people can come join me in July.
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   Sounds great.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.780]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   Wonderful.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:02.780]   This has been great.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   Thanks for being here.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:09.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:14.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   Thanks for having me.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.940]   (upbeat music)
