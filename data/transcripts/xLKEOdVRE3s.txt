[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020]   This has changed my life.
[00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.560]   House hacking.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.000]   I've done it many, many times.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   It's where you buy like a small multifamily property.
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.580]   Let's call it like a triplex, like three separate units, right?
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.560]   And they're all over the country, all over the world.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.560]   Every country's got them.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.540]   And you live in one of the units and then you rent the other ones out.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.480]   Now you don't even have to be the property manager.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.820]   You can even hire management so you don't deal with the tenants.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.940]   But the benefit is one, you can get into these deals for very low money
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.360]   down, like 3%, 4%, 5% down when you're willing to live in the
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   property for at least a year.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.860]   So let's just say you're somebody you've, you've saved up 20 grand.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.780]   Well, what's 20 grand really going to do for you, right?
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.420]   You throw it into the stock market and you make yourself 10% on your 20 grand.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.920]   Okay, good.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.300]   You're now making $2,000 a year.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.680]   It's not life-changing money, but that same 20 grand, if you were
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.140]   to buy that duplex or triplex, you could be living for free and saving what
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.580]   you'd be paying on rent somewhere else.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.620]   You can be saving a thousand, 2000, $3,000 a month and building
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.700]   equity at the same time.
