[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480]   That used to be me, until I started tuning into The Kim Commando Show.

[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160]   That's The Kim Commando Show. K-O-M-A-N-D-O. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insights, and encouragement
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.920]   years or less. My name is Joshua. I'm your host. For many years here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.520]   the most popular episode of the show was quite an unexpected hit, at least unexpected to me.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   It was episode 456, which was titled "Protect Your Money by Arrest-Proofing
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280]   Yourself and Your Children." I used the information in a book called "Arrest-Proof
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   Yourself" and talked about how it's so important that you or your children not be arrested and how
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.200]   important that is to your long-term financial life. It's no longer the most popular episode,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.080]   but for many years it was. Today, I want to continue in another episode that in some ways
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.520]   will be similar to this by talking about what to do if you are ever targeted with regard to child
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.360]   protective services. First, a headline that I saw from the Daily Wire. Here's the headline.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.120]   "An anti-Christian Reddit group falsely reported a family to child services. DeSantis," the governor
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.680]   of Florida, "says Florida won't stand for it," by Ash Show, published August 1, 2024.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.480]   A Christian family camping in Florida was the target of false reports of child abuse,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.720]   and now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says the accusers will be investigated. J.D. and Brittany
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.560]   Lott, two military veterans from Texas, and their eight kids were camping and posting to their social
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   media following of more than 600,000 when they were contacted by Florida's Department of Children
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   and Families, DCF. The family explained the situation in a two-part Instagram series and
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.280]   included screenshots of the messages they received. Their story began just a few weeks after
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.920]   Brittany gave birth to their eighth daughter, Florida's Voice reported. Brittany told the
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.640]   outlet she received a message online claiming her child was suffering from "severe jaundice,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.120]   severe sunburn, and lethargy," and Brittany deleted the message and blocked the sender.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   But according to the family's Instagram post, this wasn't just one person. Turns out it's an
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.520]   entire group of anti-Christian group working together on Reddit who concocted this crazy
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   story about us, the Lott said. A top official in the Florida governor's office told the Daily Wire
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.960]   that the targeted harassment is "unacceptable" and will be pursued by the state. "Utilizing
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.920]   government entities to make false reports or harass others is unacceptable and will be referred
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.880]   to law enforcement for investigation and, ultimately, prosecution," Brian Griffin,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   communications director for Governor Ron DeSantis' office, told the Daily Wire. And it goes on.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.040]   One more. "At the end of April, the family had just left Florida after camping at the Topsail
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   Hill Preserve State Park when they received a message from the DCF saying they were under
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   investigation. The Lotts knew immediately where the allegations had come from. An anti-Christian
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   Reddit group had been targeting the family for years. The group had ramped up its accusations
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.680]   against the Lotts since their youngest child was born with a revolving door of false accusations."
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.000]   You can read the article. I'll link to it as well as the Florida's Voice article
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.360]   and the Instagram posts by the Instagram channel called American Family Road Trip.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.040]   What interests me about this topic is that you need to be prepared with different information
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.200]   and different advice to deal with CPS, the Child Protective Services. I'm trying to figure out
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.520]   what name to use given they're kind of different in many states. You need to be prepared with a
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.760]   different set of advice to deal with CPS than you do with many other government agents. A number of
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   years ago, I read a book called Defending the Innocent from Child Protective Services by an
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.440]   author named Derek William Bootle, who is, if I remember correctly, is a psychologist and a mental
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   health counselor and has also worked as an advocate and counselor for people interacting with Child
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.600]   Protective Services. What I learned from that book is that the standard protocols that you might use
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.920]   when interacting with the police don't necessarily apply when interacting with Child Protective
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.040]   Services. If you have children, I want you to be prepared with some of this information,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.120]   and I'm going to do my best to give you an outline of what I know of that you need to be aware of
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.560]   to interact successfully with Child Protective Services, CPS, when they show up at your door.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.160]   And I'm just going to standardize and say CPS because that's the one I'm most familiar with.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.880]   Again, your state may have a different name or your country may have a different name,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.920]   but most countries, most states within the United States have some version of this.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.680]   There are a couple things that we need to be aware of. First and foremost, nobody
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.640]   wants children to be abused. And that's why most of our governments have some kind of government
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:34.800]   organization that is targeting ending child abuse. And that's probably right. That's probably how it
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.240]   should be. Now, am I for sure about that? No, but I don't want to see children abused, so I'm not
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   going to make this my particular issue to fight about and say, "This is the thing that's got to
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:54.000]   be eliminated first." But abuse can go both ways. Abuse can go in the direction of children and
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.640]   abuse can go in the direction of parents. And in the same way that there are many stories about
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   CPS doing a good job of protecting vulnerable and innocent children from abusers, there are also
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.400]   many well-documented stories of CPS abusing parents and for what outcome is unknown.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.920]   This is a unique threat that we face in the modern age because most of our governments
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.200]   encourage anonymous whistleblowers as a way of keeping the population in line.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.680]   My first personal experience with this was many years ago when I bought a house and I came home
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.200]   one day to find a big yellow notice on my front door that I was in violation of various parts of
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.640]   the code, of the county code of what I was allowed to have. Specifically, they complained that I had
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.680]   chickens, which I did, and they complained that I had a pile of brush in the backyard, which I did.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   They complained that my hedge was too tall, which as it turns out, it wasn't. And they complained
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.400]   that I had an unpermitted shed, which I did. And this was my first interaction with them.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.200]   The thing that was surprising to me is that I considered myself to be innocent
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.160]   with all of these factors. With regard to the chickens, I had specifically purchased a home
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.200]   that was in an unincorporated part of the county because it was my understanding that I would then
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.880]   be allowed to have chickens. And so I had five hens and a small chicken tractor going around my
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.400]   backyard. I didn't have a rooster, didn't want a rooster, just had five hens that I moved around
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.600]   in a chicken tractor. But I quickly learned that on something like page 515 of the county
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.440]   regulations, as it turns out, I was mistaken, because while I was in unincorporated county,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.640]   I was not in the unincorporated part of the county that allowed chickens. Okay, fine,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.560]   let's be that as it may, that's how it is. So I got rid of my chickens. The brush pile was there
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.280]   because I was actively clearing brush and I was building a hugelkultur mound rather than burn my
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   brush. That was no problem, I just got rid of it all and dealt with it. So I was doing a cool
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.840]   gardening thing that I thought would be fun experiment, but I did have a brush pile in the
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   backyard. The hedge too tall, I fought and won on the basis that I didn't have a hedge, I had
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.360]   grasses. And nobody said that my grasses couldn't be 12 feet tall and the specific type of palm
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.200]   grass that I had was technically labeled a grass, it was not labeled a tree. And so I won that case
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.560]   and the government officer listened to me and I won that. So I didn't have to trim my hedges
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.960]   because my hedge was actually grass, not a tree. And then the fourth one, the unpermitted shed was
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.880]   rather funny because the shed, according to the aerial photos from the tax collector,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.000]   was built sometime in the 1970s. And it was a big and large and beautiful shed, but somehow it
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.080]   wasn't, it hadn't been permitted at the time. So of course I'd paid extra, I was frustrated most
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.360]   about that one. I paid extra for the property and I thought it would be fine. And I went through a
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   long process with the agents and back and forth and submitted architectural drawings and blah,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.800]   blah, blah. As it turns out, my shed was about six inches over the appropriate setback and about 10
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.320]   inches too tall. So I wound up actually just tearing the shed down. That was the first time
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:32.000]   that I ever interacted with an anonymous tipster. And I realized how horrible your life can become
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.520]   if somebody makes an anonymous report against you, whether it's true or whether it's not.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.480]   And once somebody makes an anonymous report against you, the government agents are legally
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   required to investigate that report. So in the case of my chickens, the neighbor called it,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.000]   some neighbor, I still don't know who, some neighbor called in and reported me for having
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.400]   chickens to code enforcement. And then of course, while code enforcement is out there,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.200]   then they're going to do what the Department of Making Me Sad always does, and they're going to
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   find as many infractions as possible, which is how I ended up with my four code enforcement
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.760]   fractions. It's a ridiculous story, rather entertaining now, but it's a ridiculous story
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.960]   just to show. So this is where Child Protective Services, though, can be used as a weapon
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.000]   against parents by people who wish them badly. And so if you go and you start hearing the horror
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.600]   stories of when Child Protective Services is wrongly called, then usually it has to do with
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:41.120]   the divorcing spouse, with upset in-laws, with nasty neighbor, and now with someone online.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   Now let's do a quick review of how to interact with other government agents,
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.400]   such as a local police officer or a federal law enforcement officer or any kind of government
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.480]   agent that you have to interact with. The most important thing is to do everything possible
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.040]   to never be mixed up with government agents. So you want to avoid any situation or anything that
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.440]   might lead to your being suspected as for something. So if you don't want to get pulled over,
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.520]   then one of the most important things that you should do is inspect your car.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.080]   When I did previous podcast episodes on this topic, I talked about the importance of doing a
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.720]   quick car inspection. If you don't want to be pulled over, your vehicle should be in good
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.800]   running order. Your tires should not be bald. The vehicle shouldn't be loud. It shouldn't have,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.240]   you know, no muffler or weird muffler. All the lights should be working. Your license
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.960]   plate should be clearly displayed, not showing anything. That's the starting point, is you just
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.000]   make sure that you're in good shape. Make sure that your car is in good shape. Stay with me,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   even if this takes me a couple minutes, though. You're going to see all the parallels to dealing
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.800]   with Child Protective Services. So give me a couple minutes to talk about law enforcement.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.920]   The next thing that you want to do is think about your behavior. So again,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   if you are worried about interacting with the police, then you want to, as you should be,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.760]   then you want to avoid anything that might give reason for a guy with a gun and a badge to pull
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.480]   you over on the side of the street or investigate you in any way, shape, or form. So you look at
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.560]   your driving patterns and make certain that you use your turn blinker, that you don't speed,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.760]   that you don't break the law to the best of your ability, that you constantly do what needs to be
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.160]   done so that you don't have an interaction with law enforcement. If you're having a fight with
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.400]   your spouse, don't yell at each other. Don't raise your voices because if your neighbors hear that,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.480]   then all of a sudden there's going to be a police officer knocking at the door for a domestic
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.960]   disturbance complaint, something like that. So just avoid the kinds of behaviors that lead to
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.880]   your interacting with the police. The way I think of it is, I forget who to describe it to,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   it's not original with me, but don't go to stupid places with stupid people to do stupid things. If
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.480]   you just avoid that, you avoid the vast majority of problems and you never need most of the advice
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.560]   that you're going to have. Now, the next thing that's really important, though, is if you are
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:09.360]   interacting with the police, and for clarity here, I'm specifically dealing with U.S. Americans or
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.280]   any person living in the United States, regardless of who that person is. You could be a tourist from
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   Germany and all of this applies to you. But the key thing with interacting with the police is to
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.760]   exercise your rights. So you have various rights, especially under the Fourth Amendment and Fifth
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.040]   Amendment. Basically, you have the right to remain silent. And so when I train people on interacting
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.000]   with the police, there are a couple of things that are the foundation of it. Number one, you always
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.200]   want to be respectful. People who just have a bad attitude towards police officers, usually things
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.160]   don't go well for them. So you always want to be respectful and, if at all possible, you can be
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:57.520]   and be polite, be understanding. It's not your legal duty to be polite or understanding, but
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.280]   everything will go much better for you if you are polite and understanding. You also need to comply
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.760]   with the police. So you do what the police tell you to do, but you actively assert your rights.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:17.680]   And so that's most important right is remaining silent and not answering questions. So what I
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.440]   teach people to do whenever I'm teaching on the subject is to use something that is very polite.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.400]   Police officer pulls me over, starts asking me questions. I'm going to say very respectfully and
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.160]   politely, "Officer, I understand. I'm sorry to do this, and I understand that you're just doing
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.880]   your job, and it's not an easy one. But my attorney has always told me to never answer
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.520]   questions from the police. So very respectfully, I'm not going to answer any questions."
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.760]   So something like that. You need to actively assert your right, your right to remain silent,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.680]   your right not to answer questions from the police. You need to actively assert that and then
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:05.440]   remain silent. And that is the continual answer to basically any and all questions when interacting
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.200]   with any law enforcement officer in the United States is, "Officer, I'm sorry. I don't answer
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.840]   questions. I don't answer questions." There are many, many important reasons for that.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.520]   It's very hard for those of us who like to be kind and helpful and who care about things to
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.600]   know to do that. I don't enjoy using language like that. It's not my personality. But knowing
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.000]   how many ways I can be trapped into accusations of crimes that I've never committed, I have decided
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.920]   that is the only possible answer that can actually work. There's probably a little bit of texture
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.360]   here that most people should know of. You want to understand why the police are asking you questions.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.640]   So if a cop runs up and says, "Did you see a guy in a red sweatshirt run down the street this way?"
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.240]   I probably should answer that and say, rather than, "Officer, no, I don't answer questions."
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   In addition, if there's actually something that you're actively involved with,
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:08.160]   for example, I usually try to include Mossad Ayyub's advice if you've been involved in a
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.720]   self-defense shooting or something like that. While you can not answer questions and just say,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.360]   "I'm not answering questions," that's not the best strategy. In a situation like that,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.800]   you need to give a little bit of information and then wait for your lawyer. So those are the key
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   points. Now, a lot of that holds true when dealing with CPS, but not all of it. So I want you to
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.880]   assume that you're in a situation like this Instagram couple is. You're publishing your
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.920]   life online, you're publishing your family online, and all of a sudden, some wacko in a Reddit group
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.600]   who hates you calls Child Protective Services and makes an anonymous complaint against you.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.680]   First and foremost, I don't know if this is all states, but at least in my research on this
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.760]   subject, at least in many states, Child Protective Services legally can't ever tell you anything
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.240]   about who is actually making a complaint against you. So you're never going to find this out. And
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.520]   in many cases, they will have an anonymous tip line. So basically, any random person on the
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   internet can call the tip line and file a complaint against you. So you need to be prepared for that.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.600]   Whether it's in your personal life or public life, you just need to be prepared for it.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.080]   So assume that you're at home, it's a beautiful Tuesday afternoon, and all of a sudden,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:35.680]   there's a knock on the door and somebody appears. What should you do? In many cases,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:43.840]   the answer is probably not actually answer the door. But there are, of course, individual
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.040]   circumstances would vary. There are many times in which you need to answer the door.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.280]   But in many cases, when somebody random knocks on the door, it's probably best not to open the door.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:01.360]   If you do answer the door, it's probably best to answer the door through some kind of intercom or
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:08.800]   video doorbell. That's usually a good plan, rather than appearing personally. However,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.920]   I'm probably not that hardcore. I respect those who are. Normally, if someone knocks on the door,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.080]   I'm going to answer the door, because we don't know what's going on. And as you'll see, as I
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.920]   uncover the specifics of CPS, especially when dealing with CPS, it is probably best to answer
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:30.080]   the door and speak to whoever happens to be there. So the most important protocol,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.520]   anytime you're answering the door and it seems like there's somebody there with a badge, somebody
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.800]   there with an embroidered shirt, somebody official, do not ever invite that person into your home.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.880]   The first thing that you do is step outside of the house and close the door behind you,
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.080]   and in some cases, lock the door behind you, but at least close the door behind you.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:01.920]   You have an inviolable right to be secure in your home and to be protected from search
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:09.040]   or seizure in your home unless the person has an actual court-ordered warrant, court-issued
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   warrant. And so don't ever invite a police officer, don't ever invite a child protective
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.440]   services agent, don't ever invite any government agent into your home. Step outside the house,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.840]   close the door behind you, and then deal with the actual circumstances.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.200]   What will ordinarily happen is that the CPS agent will identify himself or herself and start to
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.720]   explain to you that we've received a complaint, we're here for an investigation, and start to
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:48.560]   give you information. Now the first thing you need to be aware of is that CPS has a different legal
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   approach or a different legal standard than someone like a police officer does.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.600]   With a police officer, you can always invoke your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.920]   So while, of course, there's probably some reasonable level of, "Hello, officer,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.400]   why are you here?" pretty much at the first question, if the officer asks you a question
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.120]   and you get any sense that it's about you or something like that, then pretty quickly your
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.760]   answer should be, "I'm sorry, officer. I know you're just doing your job, and it's not an easy
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:26.240]   one, but I don't answer questions." And then ask for an attorney if you're going to answer any
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.720]   questions. You would never answer questions without the presence of your attorney.

[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.440]   not an endorsement. Other restrictions apply. That's because in the United States, you are
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.720]   always innocent until proven guilty. It is not your responsibility as a citizen to give a law
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.000]   enforcement officer evidence against you. If the government has evidence that you've committed a
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.240]   crime or are suspected of a crime or suspected of involvement in something, it is the job of the
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.840]   state to come up with that evidence and then bring that evidence against you. But you are innocent
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.320]   until proven guilty. And so you can and should always confidently assert your rights when dealing
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:46.960]   with law enforcement. With CPS, it is not that way. You must speak to CPS and you must answer
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:56.240]   questions. Why? Well, if a police officer comes to your door and knocks on the door and you don't
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.400]   answer any questions, then that officer goes back to his office and says, you know, I couldn't
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.840]   acquire any evidence of a crime, so we're done. However, if CPS has received a complaint, they're
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:14.000]   not allowed to drop the investigation until they get the information that they need to dismiss
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.560]   the complaint. So imagine that somebody calls in a report of a bunch of starving kids at the house
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:29.760]   next door. And a CPS officer receives this report of a bunch of starved children and comes out and
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.960]   knocks on the door and you step outside the house, kids are inside, you close the door behind you,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.880]   and you just flat out refuse to answer questions. You don't talk to the officer at all. What is the
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.120]   officer going to do? Well, the CPS officer has a duty to the children to make sure that they're
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   okay. And so he or she is going to immediately go to court, the judge is going to issue a warrant,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:00.480]   and he or she will be back in an hour or two or very quickly with a police officer and a warrant
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.720]   in order to invade your home and do a full inspection and a full review of you. So what
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.120]   you're trying to do is you're trying to avoid that. And in order to avoid that, you have to
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:18.880]   give the CPS official the necessary information in order to be satisfied that no children are in
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:27.040]   danger, that children are well treated, that there's no abuse happening. You have to give
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:35.520]   the information that is needed so that they can say, "Yes, we've investigated this complaint,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.160]   it's a spurious complaint, there's no evidence of abuse, and we're closing the complaint."
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.800]   That's the major difference, is they can't drop the investigation. And so you're basically
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.480]   presumed to be guilty until you can prove that you're innocent. That's very different than
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.840]   interacting with law enforcement. When CPS is involved, you're basically considered to be guilty
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.200]   until you can prove that you're innocent. So you need to speak to them, and you need to answer
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.760]   their questions. So, of course, you should go outside, and the first thing that you should do
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.920]   is turn on some kind of recording advice. You should take your phone out, you should turn the
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:19.680]   video camera on, and you should start recording the interaction immediately. And it should be
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:28.000]   evident in the recording that you are recording. So you always have the right to record public
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.560]   officials who are doing their duty. Public officials who are exercising their office
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.600]   have no presumption of privacy in that scenario. So you always can record all public officials
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.240]   who are doing their duty. And especially, remember, you are in your home, and so you
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.520]   have full right to record in your home. You can always record, and you should. You should record,
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:01.600]   you must record everything that happens with the officer, or with, I shouldn't use officer
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.160]   because we're talking about a CPS representative, with the CPS agent. Record everything. And that
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.240]   should immediately be standard operating procedure for everything. So if you have an interaction,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.760]   a personal interaction, you record with video. If you're on the phone, you record video. At the
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.840]   very least, you put the phone on speakerphone, and you have a friend use his or her cell phone
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.600]   to record the audio of you and record all calls, record everything. That's the first thing.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.840]   The next thing that you need to do is you need to understand and ask questions about what's
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:41.440]   actually happening. So your job is to identify why is this CPS agent here? What are they actually
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:48.880]   asking? What are the charges? So you should ask as many questions as possible about the charges
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:56.160]   and information. You should not try to volunteer any information to them in response to questions.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.840]   The first thing you should do is ask questions yourself to understand all of the details of
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.720]   everything that is going on. Again, back to the same parallel with the police. You should be
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.520]   respectful. You should be kind. You should be polite. This is not the time to get angry. This
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.800]   is not the time to be belligerent. Remember that if you were to get angry, and let's say you started
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.400]   swearing at the government agent, you can legally swear at a police officer all you want. You'll
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.040]   probably get much rougher treatment. You'll probably get quite frustrated police officer.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.840]   But swearing at a police officer and being incredibly rude to a police officer is not
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.880]   legally something that is a problem. You can do that. You'd be stupid to do it, but you can do
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.280]   that. A police officer has to deal with that. However, a CPS agent has the ability to interpret
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.600]   that in many other ways. And so if you start swearing and getting angry at someone, well,
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.680]   all of a sudden now going in your case that you've got anger issues, decent chance you're going to
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:00.640]   lose your children. And so you need to understand what they're actually going for. Let me read a
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.000]   short excerpt from Defending the Innocent from Child Protective Services here. "Do not volunteer
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   any information, even if you think it is going to be helpful in your case. This is not the time to
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.480]   open up your past and discuss your issues. People like to use personal historical information to
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.360]   support their position to address CPS accusations. This is a bad idea. When answering a CPS question,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.720]   make the answer short and sweet with no backstory. An example of this would be when CPS says,
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.560]   "We have a report of drug use in the house." The incorrect answer is, "I haven't used drugs in
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.440]   five years. I went to rehab and have been clean and sober since." This answer just provided the
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   CPS agent with information that will now be used to build a drug case against you.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.800]   What is to say that you haven't gone back to using? Child Protective Services will use this
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.640]   as, "Parent has a history of drug abuse and could be trying to deceive us." The CPS agent will use
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.200]   any loose end like this as a way to manipulate you and turn your story against you. The only
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.440]   correct answer to this statement is, "No, I don't use drugs." With this statement, it leaves nothing
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.280]   for them to build a case, nothing that they could use as an "in" to your situation. In the report,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.600]   the CPS agent will state, "Suspect denies drug use." Every statement stated to CPS must be thought
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.960]   of in this way. Do not give them a loose thread to pull or your family will unravel like a cheap
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:32.720]   sweater. The charges are going to dictate what steps to take next. Depending on the severity
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.680]   of the charges, this will dictate what you can and should do. If the allegations include direct harm
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:47.120]   to a child, assault, neglect, you will have to let them see the child. This does not mean you have to
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   allow CPS into your house. Have them meet with the child on the front step briefly and in your
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.480]   presence and be sure to record the discussion. Inform CPS that the meeting is being recorded.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:06.160]   Do not allow CPS to talk with the child alone, ever. Child Protective Services will be able to
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.600]   make up evidence they need from the child's testimony and you will have no defense against it.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.200]   Children do not testify in court and the words they use are taken at face value. Even though you
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.560]   can explain it, that evidence will be used against you. An example would be if they took the child
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.480]   to the car and asked, "Has mommy or daddy ever put something in your behind?" The child will answer,
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.920]   "Yes." "What was it?" will be the next question and of course the answer will be, "I don't know."
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.080]   Now you are losing your son and facing 15 years in prison because you used a rectal thermometer
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.360]   on a three-year-old and the child couldn't explain you were taking his temperature.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:50.880]   So be aware of these kinds of factors. Do not let CPS into your house. There is no reason
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.920]   to let CPS into your house in any circumstance. The only reason that a CPS worker can enter into
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.520]   your home is, first, an emergency situation. So just like a police officer, if a police officer
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.680]   is standing at your door and you've got the door open and he looks past and sees somebody being
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.960]   murdered in the back room, the police officer is now able to come in without a warrant because
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.680]   there's a situation happening. Same thing applies to CPS. If there's some kind of emergency situation,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:24.320]   there's immediate and obvious danger, then the CPS officer can come in. Or they have to come
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.400]   with a search warrant or they come in with your permission. But don't give permission.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.640]   There's no benefit for you of giving permission. Now before we go too hard line, let's think about
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.080]   and talk about what are the standards. When I've researched this subject, I'm doing my best to try
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:48.560]   to squarely be practical and understanding and straightforward. And I'm not scared to exercise
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.480]   rights because that's what we should always do. A right that is not exercised generally gets lost.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.320]   But then the question is, what are they actually looking for? Do I need to be worried about what
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.720]   they find in my home? And so here is from a blog article by attorney Brett Pritchard
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:14.400]   that I read that I thought was really good. He says, "What CPS looks for during a home visit.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.800]   CPS caseworkers are trained to look for anything that could be used against you.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.120]   A CPS investigator will keep the following questions in mind during a home inspection.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.800]   One, is there enough healthy food in the house? Two, is food readily available to your children?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:34.000]   Three, what are the sleeping arrangements for the kids? Four, do the children have plenty of clothes?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   Five, how clean is the house? Six, are there any safety hazards in the house?
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.000]   Seven, are there any drugs, weapons, or chemicals left in the open?" So these questions to me seem
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.320]   reasonable, and any parent, we should all be able to pass a CPS home inspection at any time.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.040]   Let's go into some more details. Here's a list of things a child protective services investigator
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.760]   will look for when visiting your home. Cleanliness, sanitary conditions, CPS will inspect the
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.360]   cleanliness of your house to ensure that your home has sanitary conditions for your kids.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:12.240]   Your home should have sanitary conditions. Feces, it is a major red flag when a CPS caseworker finds
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.560]   human, animal, and rodent feces in the house. That should be self-evident. Infestation, the
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.520]   investigator will also look for insect and rodent infestation, so get rid of any cockroaches and
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:30.240]   other pests before the CPS visit. Trash, do not expect a CPS worker to ignore piles of trash in
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.760]   the home. Laundry, CPS will not be pleased about piles of dirty laundry scattered around the house.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.680]   Smell, the very first thing a CPS caseworker will notice during a home visit is the smell.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.360]   Get rid of any unpleasant odors, including the smell of cigarette smoke in the house.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:52.080]   These seem like reasonable things to me, and so we should just live this way. We should not be
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:59.600]   in any fear of failing a cleanliness inspection. Next category, kitchen. Rotten food, there should
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.920]   be no rotten, moldy, or spoiled food in the house if you want to make a good impression on CPS.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.600]   Healthy foods, food choices play a role, so make sure that your kitchen has plenty of healthy foods
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.640]   such as fruits and vegetables. Availability of food, food must be readily available to
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.680]   your children, so make sure that your refrigerator, pantry, and cupboards are
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.120]   stocked with healthy food. Knives and other sharp dangerous objects, any knives, matches,
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.040]   razors, and other dangerous items within reach of your kids will definitely catch the CPS
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.240]   investigator's attention. I'm okay with all of those things as well, those are standard things,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.480]   just make sure that they're in place. Safety hazards, choking, strangulation, suffocation,
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.600]   and poisoning hazards. A CPS investigator will look for any objects or hazards that could cause
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:49.520]   choking, suffocation, strangulation, or poisoning, so it is vital to thoroughly inspect your home
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.120]   for those hazards before the CPS home visit. That to me of all of these is probably one of the
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.480]   biggest ones because the choking hazards, I think most of us wind up with various choking hazards
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.920]   as careful as you are, but pay attention to that and make certain that you eliminate hazards from
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:11.120]   your home for the good of your children. Slip, trip, and fall hazards, your home should be free
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.840]   of clutter, loose rugs, secured wires, slippery surfaces, and other slip, trip, or fall hazards.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.920]   Electrical hazards, any electrical hazards are also a red flag for CPS during a home visit,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.360]   make sure that there are no exposed electrical parts or wiring in the house.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   Burn hazards, CPS will look for any hazards including electrical equipment, chemicals,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:39.440]   and thermal contact that could result in burn injuries to a child. Fire hazards, make sure
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.200]   that flammable items are far away from open flame in the house, a CPS investigator may also ask you
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.560]   if your house is equipped with smoke alarms. Chemicals and cleaning products, while cleaning
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.440]   your house is good, household cleaners and other chemicals should be stored out of kids reach.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.080]   General safety hazards, broken appliances, malfunctioning utilities, or lack thereof,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.960]   shattered glass, stairs without gates, mold, gas leaks, and other safety hazards
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.680]   may catch the CPS workers attention. Now before I go on, I again want to affirm these
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.120]   things, these seem like obviously important things. I can understand you might be in the
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.280]   middle of a remodeling project and you might have exposed electrical wires, well that's a reasonable
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.040]   thing that you might do, so I can understand why people can get in trouble with this, but these
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.960]   seem like good standards that we should pay attention to. I'll give you a tip though that I
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:41.600]   think is really important. Have a locking cabinet. I think before you go through all the hassle of
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.520]   installing a bunch of weird like child safety locks, you know what I mean, like the magnet
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.200]   things and things that people do, which is an enormous hassle, just have one locking cabinet
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.600]   in your house. If any kind of locking cabinet, you actually need a key to open or a code pad
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.400]   or something like that, and just put all the dangerous stuff in there so that you can be
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.120]   confident that it's actually locked up. As a parent, having a place, a home safe, we'll talk
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.560]   about firearms in a minute, but having a home safe, maybe just have a big gun safe or something
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:19.120]   like that, and knowing that my things that I need to be private from my children and from their
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:26.640]   little snooping fingers are properly locked away is a great feeling. If you don't have a locking
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:32.080]   cabinet, what I really like is those locking boxes. What are they called? The ones that the
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.440]   construction workers use, job box. They're called a job box usually. You can pick up a job box. You
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.680]   can pick one up brand new for a couple hundred dollars. You can pick them up used all the time,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.920]   and they take a couple of padlocks and put one in your garage and keep your chemicals and things
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.040]   like that locked up so that they're there. If you have many chemicals, and we're not just talking
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.440]   about a bottle of bleach and a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner, whatever you happen to have,
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:01.040]   then you should engage in that stuff of your own volition. If you're keeping things like hazardous
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.120]   chemicals around, you should have proper compartments for them, and a proper locker
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.960]   is a standard part of chemical safety. So have a place where the stuff is actually locked up,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   and that will give you enormous peace of mind as a parent. Next, sleeping arrangements. Children
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.840]   under 18 months. Children under 18 months should sleep in a crib with no pillows, blankets,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:29.600]   stuffed toys, or other materials. That's standard parenting advice. Bunk beds. If your children are
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.240]   sleeping in bunk beds, they should have railings on both sides to prevent falls. It is not safe
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.040]   for children under the age of six to sleep in a top bunk. Again, I got no problem with that.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   Opposite-sex children. If you have a boy and a girl, they must sleep in separate bedrooms
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:51.200]   at ages five and older. Firearms. Guns and weapons. If you possess any firearms or weapons,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.920]   they should be stored unloaded and in a locked cabinet out of reach of children.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.280]   My only contention here is what's the point of having an unloaded gun? So certainly if they're
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.720]   not in use, they can be stored unloaded, but the most important thing is just that they're loaded
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.560]   and ready to go, but that they're in a locked cabinet out of reach of children. Ammunition.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.400]   Ammunition should be stored separately from firearms. Again, I don't know what the point
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.800]   of storing ammunition separately from firearms is, but I guess if I had a CPS inspection,
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.240]   then I would probably do that. But obviously, ammunition should be stored inside firearms or
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.880]   they're useless when you need them. Alcohol and drugs. Illegal drugs. There should not be any
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.000]   illicit drugs or substances in the house. Prescription and over-the-counter medications.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.040]   Medicine should be stored in a locked cabinet out of sight and reach of children. Alcohol.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.080]   Any alcohol in the house should be stored out of kids' reach. Again, those seem like
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:47.680]   obviously important things. Have a locked cabinet for your medicine. Have no illegal drugs in the
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.880]   house, obviously. And alcohol should be out of reach of children. Outside. Swimming pool. If
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.000]   you have a swimming pool in the backyard, it should have fencing to prevent younger children
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.480]   from drowning. Duh. Road safety. If your house is near the road, your property should have fencing
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.800]   to limit the play area of your children and to make sure that they stay away from the road.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.840]   So recognize that in most cases, I think those are fine. With the exception of my comments about
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:21.280]   unloaded weapons, I think those are all perfectly fine and reasonable expectations. So let's not,
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:28.320]   let's not, you know, get too crazy with this. Now, if CPS enters your house, again, you would
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.120]   want them to enter your house with a warrant. If they want to come into your house, you should
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.760]   tell them, "No, I'm not comfortable having you in my house." And so they're going to ask, "Why?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   Why are you not comfortable?" And you just say, "I don't trust you and I don't know who you are.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:50.560]   So why would I have you in my house?" Back to defending the innocent from Child Protective
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.240]   Services. If they ask to enter your house, let them know that you're not comfortable having
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.160]   them enter your house. They'll ask why as they investigate for information to use against you.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.560]   Just let them know you do not trust them and you do not know who they are. I know it sounds bad,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.040]   but you have to come up with an excuse that they can't use against you, saying, "I don't want you
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.320]   to," or, "It's not clean," gives them another thread to pull. Asking, "Why do you want to go
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.640]   in? What are you looking for?" places the focus back on them. If they insist on entering your
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.120]   home, you'll have to invoke your Fourth Amendment right of no unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.920]   It won't stop them from going in, but it lets them know your rights. It lets them know that
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   you know your rights and are willing to fight in court for them. Although your Fourth Amendment
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.160]   right, no unreasonable search and seizure, should prevent CPS and the police from entering your home
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.280]   without a court order, it doesn't. Child Protective Services isn't under the same legal jurisdiction as
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.000]   police. Child Protective Services is not constrained by the police rules of conduct, and the evidence
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.800]   obtained from an illegal CPS search will not automatically be disqualified by obtaining
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.120]   evidence illegally, fruit of the poisonous tree. This is a very touchy subject and should be
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.320]   understood carefully. Child Protective Services are not allowed in your house without an invitation,
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.560]   but if they walk in and conduct the search without a warrant, the family court judge will
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.600]   take the evidence and suggest the parent file charges in criminal court. As well, 33 states
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:13.760]   in America have occupational immunity, which covers the CPS agent in case of illegal actions performed
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.160]   while in the performance of their duties, which means you may not be able to file a civil or
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.960]   criminal grievance depending on where you live. Also, a CPS agent who is willing to go to the
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.880]   judge to get a search warrant for your house will most likely use the same information
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.920]   to obtain an emergency removal order from the same judge. It doesn't take much to get a court order.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.320]   The CPS agent tells a judge, "We have a report of abuse, and the guardian will not allow us to
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.120]   check on the safety of the child." Child Protective Services, now with a police escort and a warrant,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.440]   is in your house, and the child is in foster care. Your actions depend partially on the
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.240]   charges presented to you while you're talking to CPS. If it's a severe charge, similar to assault
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.440]   or neglect, they will have to see the child to ease their concerns. You may have no other choice,
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.400]   but allow them into the house to appease the CPS agent. You may have no choice but to let them in,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.040]   and if you do, expect a long court trial. So the point is that you have to be careful,
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:13.520]   and the goal is to provide the necessary information for the CPS agent to end the
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.560]   investigation. So you have the information of what the allegations against you are,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:27.760]   and if the agent says, "Hey, we got reports of your child being malnourished," then bring your
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.440]   child out on the front porch and say, "This child is not malnourished, obviously." But the goal is
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:40.320]   to just give the minimum information, and then as quickly as possible get a lawyer and deal with
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.280]   things with a lawyer and with representation. Now, one of the things that I really appreciate
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:51.360]   about the Defending the Innocent from Child Protective Services book is that the author
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:58.720]   talks about the difference between trying to get a gotcha moment with the CPS and actually
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:04.560]   getting what you're trying to do, which is to actually protect your child and not have your
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:11.280]   child taken away from you wrongfully. So when you go on YouTube and you spend time
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.960]   seeing things on YouTube, you see somebody recording something and someone, in many cases,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.000]   standing up for his or her rights, and that's fine. That's good, except that you don't necessarily see
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.160]   what comes next. Your goal is not to win an interaction by having this person turn around
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:34.720]   and leave. Your goal is to present the evidence necessary for the CPS officer to do his or her
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:42.080]   job and close the case. Be cordial. Having your children removed by CPS or being threatened to
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.240]   have your children removed is an emotional situation. I can't think of a worse thing to
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.400]   do to a parent than to take the kids they love and forcefully adopt them out to strangers,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.640]   just because an anonymous tip from someone you may or may not know caught the ear of a CPS agent,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.880]   and they decided to come for an investigation. The Italian mafia has rules against targeting
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.840]   children, but our government does not. Child Protective Services understand this will be
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.800]   a stressful time for you and will use it to their advantage. They will document everything you say,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.200]   everything you do, and fully use it against you in court. Take warning of Dave and Sonia's case,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.760]   a case discussed elsewhere in the book. Do not threaten violence or harm on the CPS agent. Do
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.000]   not convey hostility or aggression towards them. Talk in a calm, civil tone with no swearing.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.240]   This topic is as important as recording them and not allowing them into your house.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.600]   Your demeanor is the data CPS obtains from you at every meeting you have with them.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.080]   If you threaten to harm or commit violence against anyone in front of a CPS agent,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.200]   the CPS agent will perform an emergency removal of your child and place a restraint order upon you.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.000]   Then, expect those words to be used against you in not only CPS cases,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.200]   but as evidence against you in any state or federal case in the future.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.360]   Ten years down the line, you will be considered a threat, even if you've been to counseling,
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.480]   taking medications, apologized, or died. You will be in your state CPS record forever.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:09.440]   CPS documents every action. If you come across to them as reasonable and understanding of the
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.800]   situation, you can manage your way out of CPS charges, as detailed in the next scenario with
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.520]   Frank and his daughter. But if you automatically swear at, threaten CPS, and slam the door in the
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.280]   CPS agent's face, accept police and a court order for search, seizure, and removal of the child
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:31.520]   within 30 minutes. Your presentation is crucial. How you say things and how your body language is
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.560]   in the first few minutes of contact is paramount to your success in defeating the investigation.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.360]   If you come across as defensive, the CPS agent is automatically going to be suspicious of you.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:46.480]   Getting angry and asking over and over, "Why are you here?" and "Who sent you?" will only make a
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:52.400]   great YouTube video. What doesn't make for great YouTube videos is the long fight with CPS and the
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:57.840]   expensive court battle that is set against you, which could have been avoided with a different
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.600]   approach. Your approach should be calm and pleasant, as if this is an ordinary, everyday
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:09.760]   occurrence. Listening to what's being said and providing short and to-the-point direct answers
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:18.880]   can avoid a long, expensive fight later. Don't give CPS any reason to return. Please and thank
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:26.800]   you go a long way to saving thousands of dollars in court costs and your children's future. Many
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.000]   of the cases in family court do not need to be there. If you know how to handle yourself and the
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.160]   CPS agent, you could be out of trouble before a case is formed. Knowing how and what CPS does
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:46.480]   helps in managing these issues. So the point is, you don't win by being combative with CPS.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.400]   You win by understanding that almost certainly this officer cares about children, and it's his
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.800]   or her job to make certain that innocent children are not being harmed, and he or she undoubtedly
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:08.720]   cares about that. So your job is to present the necessary evidence so that the agent can be
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:15.600]   satisfied that this child is not in danger, is not in harm. Most lawyers agree when talking to the
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.400]   police, the less you say, the better. The police are looking for information to charge you with a
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:28.000]   crime. Child Protective Services is looking for information not to identify a crime, but to
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.160]   substantiate or refute the accusation. There is a big difference between talking to police and
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.840]   talking to Child Protective Services. With police, you have the right to remain silent, and it cannot
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:46.560]   be used against you. This is not the case with CPS. The worst thing you can do with CPS is to refuse
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:53.040]   to meet with them and ignore the charges. If you refuse to cooperate with CPS and refuse to attend,
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.400]   it will be written in the report. Then the refusal will be used against you, and worse, have your
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:04.160]   child removed from the house. CPS will use any refusal to participate as evidence against you.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:11.120]   The judge, always siding on the safety and welfare of the child and CPS, will automatically infer
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.800]   that you are hiding something until you prove otherwise. Remember, unlike criminal charges,
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.880]   your right to remain silent is not guaranteed when dealing with CPS.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   When you talk to the CPS agent, discuss only the charges. See if you can figure out who contacted
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   them and why they did so. If there's any concern, try to normalize the behavior.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.560]   Just like Frank, previous story, you don't take your kid to the doctor every time they get the
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.440]   sniffles. By behaving normal and explaining the circumstances around it, you look less like an
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.280]   abuser and more like a regular parent doing their best for their child. Look for information.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.640]   Interviews are not one-sided discussions. Feel free to ask questions of the CPS agent.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.960]   Ask who filed the charges. Child Protective Service is not legally allowed to tell you,
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.360]   but sometimes they make mistakes or give hints about who filed the charges. Sometimes you can
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.000]   read their body language to receive clues of whether it's a family member, neighbor, teacher,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.080]   or enemy. Ask what the accusations are. Information is vital because you can only defend yourself
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.600]   against what you know. Ask for specifics on how or what they believe happened and why that is a
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.200]   problem. For example, if someone claimed you hit your child, ask, "With what? How hard were they
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.160]   hit? Where on the body were they struck? Could it have been someone else?" Then discuss how it wasn't
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:43.200]   you and who else it could be. Now, in the book, the next specific advice is always hire a lawyer,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   and that's always good advice, is to have a lawyer and have representation. You should
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:55.040]   additionally have witnesses whenever possible, so you should not be with CPS alone. Your child
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.440]   should never speak to CPS alone, and so you should have a lawyer who's able to be there.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.280]   There may be times in which your child needs to speak with a CPS agent. You would do that under
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.160]   the advice of the lawyer with your lawyer present. Again, you have to provide enough
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:18.400]   information to specifically demonstrate that the complaint against you is a false complaint.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.240]   Now, what is the big picture that we can do? Well, first and foremost, that's why I went
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:30.800]   through kind of the examples, just do the proper thing. Live a life and a lifestyle that is above
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.680]   reproach so that if at any point in time somebody knocked on your door, your house would be put
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:41.760]   together, your children would be well taken care of. Create a lifestyle of care. And a lot of the
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:47.920]   things that I would do and that you would do automatically protect children. Children who
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:54.080]   are born into a family and they have a mom and a dad and there's no extra people involved and
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.720]   there's not a bunch of random people coming through the house and there's just one set of
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.840]   children have extraordinarily low rates of abuse. A single parent with various boyfriends and
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.600]   girlfriends passing through the house, broken homes, children coming and going, all of a sudden
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:18.880]   the rates of abuse go up enormously. And so you need to build the environment around your children
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:26.720]   so that they are in a safe environment at all time. You want to always think ahead of what
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:34.480]   would happen if you were charged with something. So what would happen, what would your defense be
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:41.440]   if CPS came against you? And then do the things that would be necessary to actually provide the
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:47.920]   defense in court. So, for example, number one, don't be neglectful of your children. Make certain
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.880]   that you hire a proper babysitter if you're going to be away, that you understand what your state's
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.920]   laws are and what good practices are, that you take your children to the doctor, that they have
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.080]   regular medical checkups, that they have good medical care. All the stuff that you would do
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.960]   as a good parent is the stuff that you would present in court that would show that you're
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.200]   a good parent. So this is always the important things. And recognize that you should collect
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.320]   and have the data for this kind of thing. So strategy. Your strategy should begin before
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   the first contact. It should be a plan for if CPS comes to your house. I'm fully aware that I'm on
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.120]   a CPS list somewhere as a problem person just because I wrote this book. So before I started
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.920]   writing, I planned what I want the first CPS contact to look like and how to manage it.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:42.560]   This strategy includes four goals. Diffusing the CPS charge, information. Proving CPS wrong,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.680]   data conflicts, keeping CPS out of my life, and maintaining custody of my children,
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:53.840]   court. Everything I plan to do is based on these four goals. Being right, being belligerent,
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.600]   or asserting constitutional rights are nowhere on this list. In every defense, you need strategy,
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.960]   plan, and tactics, actions. The approach is predicated on the situation you find yourself in,
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.040]   what the charges are, and what you want as an outcome. A strategy is a plan of action to diffuse,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.840]   redirect, and redirect the charges that are presented. A strategy is not, "I'm going to make
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   fools of CPS," or, "I'm going to tell the judge what I think and she's going to do what I say."
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.400]   These are only wishes and will make you look like a fool in court and to lose your child.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.800]   You may have noticed in this book, I've referred to everything as a defense.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   That's because everything you do with CPS is a defense. A family court hearing is not the
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:40.480]   place to attack CPS. It will make you vulnerable and considered emotionally unstable, and the judge
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:45.040]   doesn't care. If the CPS agent walks straight into your house, took a beer from your fridge,
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:51.840]   and drank it in front of you, it is irrelevant to your case. That needs to be addressed in a conduct
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:58.240]   report to CPS superiors or in a lawsuit for misconduct, but not in family court. Remember,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:04.480]   the court cares only about the court proceedings and the welfare of the child. This means crimes
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.360]   perpetrated against you by Child Protective Services will not be addressed in family court.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:16.160]   The focus is on you, not them. You need to show evidence none of the things occurred or show
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.600]   third-party evidence that Child Protective Services is wrong. You are defending yourself,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:28.480]   and the mindset should be only of that. Each line in the CPS service plan must be argued and
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:33.920]   defended. It is imperative to take each of the items from the progress plan and isolate each
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.960]   one, then provide evidence directly countering each charge. Defense isn't just for the main
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.360]   issues, but as many as possible. A good lawyer will be able to present this to the judge.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.520]   There is a possibility CPS will surrender the case at this point due to the counter evidence.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.720]   However, as a defendant, do not consider this a probable conclusion. Each item should be listed
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.600]   and some document provided to disprove the issue. This becomes the crux of the defense.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:02.720]   It is vital to provide these documents to the court. The records become the witnesses that
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:09.040]   CPS cannot argue. It is easy to confuse a witness on the stand. It is easy to ignore a parent's
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.560]   rights, but documentation becomes a thorn in the side of any prosecution. These documents can be
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   almost anything from grocery receipts, video to medical reports, psychiatric evaluations to
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.680]   checking account records. Every paper and video proves something that can be used to chip away at
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   the CPS case. You can go on, read more in the book about tactics, things like that. It's a good book.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:40.640]   It's not nearly as good as Arrest Proof Yourself. And I don't know how, I mean, the guy believes
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:49.280]   strongly that CPS has an incentive and a desire to kidnap children with a financial incentive.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.760]   I don't know if this is true or not. I know that it is true in some places with some people in
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.560]   some countries and some counties and some prosecutors. But I would guess that those are
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:04.320]   the exception, not the rule. And I hope I'm not wrong about that. So I don't worry too much about
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:12.560]   that. But certainly we've heard enough horror stories with ex-spouses and angry people and
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:20.800]   wackos on the internet. You should take this seriously. At its core, I think how I think
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:29.760]   about this subject is basically two things. Number one is be a good parent and be the kind
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:36.080]   of person that is providing all that a child needs. If you are doing that and intentional
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:41.200]   about doing that, then that in and of itself is probably going to be the number one key.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:49.920]   If you are doing something that makes you vulnerable, then pay attention to that and
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:56.640]   document your performance. So the biggest vulnerability that a guy like me would have
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:03.360]   would be homeschooling. Now, this was a huge issue in the United States in 1960s and '70s
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:09.360]   and '80s. At that time, I know lots of homeschooling families that they had to be hyper
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:15.280]   aware of basically the truant officers and child protective services and asserting their rights as
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.240]   homeschoolers. At the time, it was very legally questionable what their actual rights were
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:27.840]   in the United States with regard to homeschooling. So I've talked to many older ladies who the idea
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.880]   they would never, ever take their children out during the day to the grocery store, something
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.080]   like that, because then someone's going to file a complaint. Why aren't these kids in school?
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:44.160]   And so they would always make certain that they were home and that there was no obvious evidence
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.880]   that their children were home at that time. Now, thankfully, in the United States, we pretty well
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:55.120]   won that battle. And so the legal situation of homeschooling is very well ensconced now in law
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.240]   and in the vast majority of states. You hear some whining from various states here and there,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.600]   but in general, it's one of the best total victories of a political movement that I care
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:11.440]   about in the United States, that that's not really a risk at this point in time for most people.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.680]   I know a lot of people around the world, though, who still have that, who are very careful that
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.440]   if it's a school day, their children are not outside in the backyard, but they're inside
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.160]   studying. What I always just imagine is I just say I have a higher responsibility.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:32.880]   So if I'm going to homeschool, I need to make certain that I'm not being neglectful of children.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.960]   Some people are super into student-directed education and unschooling and all that. I think
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:46.000]   there's a place for that, but I believe I have a responsibility of a higher degree of performance,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.320]   higher degree of academic performance than others do. And so I keep careful records,
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.400]   want to make certain that I can demonstrate the academic performance of my children and have good
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:03.040]   records about what we're actually doing, even though my state doesn't require that. So I still
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:08.720]   am going to do it. And I think that same basic thing applies. Imagine that CPS knocks at your
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:14.640]   door today. Just imagine it. And then ask yourself, well, what would my vulnerability be?
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:19.120]   If it's homeschooling and are you giving your child the education that he deserves,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   then make certain that you are and that you have the data to demonstrate it. If it's cleanliness
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.760]   of the house, then fix the house. Do whatever you need to do to fix the house. If it's a bad
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.920]   relationship with mom and dad are yelling at each other all the time and the cops are going to knock
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.800]   at the door, then fix it. Take some classes on how to communicate better and how to resolve
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.040]   conflict and fix the relationship. And if it's unfixable, I guess recognize that it's unfixable.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:50.240]   The point is, think about it. What would happen? And do you have evidence of it? So keep records
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:57.120]   of an annual checkup from your physician and keep records of your dental cleanings and keep records
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.480]   of the food in the house and make sure that there is the food in the house, things like that.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.560]   If you have those documents, then you should win your case. And that's what you need to know.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   So that's the first thing that I want to emphasize is just have the environment that is going to be
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   appropriate so you don't have a problem. And then the second thing that I wanted to emphasize is
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:24.800]   what's different about dealing with CPS versus dealing with the police. For the fourth time,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:32.720]   you can't have the same basic approach with CPS that you do with the police.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.920]   With the police, the only safety you have of any kind of law enforcement officer,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.280]   any kind of police officer, any kind of any government agent,
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:50.480]   the only safety you have is not to answer questions. If you lie to a police officer,
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.400]   remember, if you lie to a police officer, even inadvertently, that's a felony offense.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.840]   You could be put into jail just for lying to federal officers. Martha Stewart, a little bit
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.160]   long in the tooth now in terms of the case is a little bit old, but remember, Martha Stewart
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:13.200]   didn't go to prison for insider trading. She went to prison for lying to federal officers.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.400]   Your only possible pathway of navigating a very difficult legal system with officers of any kind
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:29.040]   is do not speak to them actively. And by the way, just remember, it's not enough to just remain
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.840]   silent. You can't just not speak. You have to specifically state, "I am exercising my right to
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.640]   remain silent and I want a lawyer. I'm remaining silent. I'm not answering questions. I want a
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.440]   lawyer. I want a lawyer. I want a lawyer. I'm not answering questions. I don't answer questions. I
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   want a lawyer. I'm sorry, officer. I don't answer questions. I want a lawyer." That's your only
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.120]   possible pathway. Because if you mess up, if you say something wrong, if you give them information,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.320]   there's no protection for you whatsoever except, "I don't speak and I want a lawyer."
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.120]   And then you go into the court process as necessary. You deal with all of the appropriate
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.240]   depositions with the advice of your lawyer. That's the only way to deal with it with the police.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.160]   CPS is not that way. And that's why I'm emphasizing this so much because when I learned this,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:25.120]   I realized this is important. You do have a Fourth Amendment right to keep CPS out of your house.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:32.240]   And as the author of that book stated, 30 minutes later, the CPS agent will be back
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.640]   with a police officer and a warrant, and your child is not sleeping at your home that day.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.280]   So you need to exercise your rights actively. Don't give away more information than is necessary,
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.680]   but you need to answer the questions because your goal is to demonstrate to the CPS officer
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:58.160]   that your child is safe, your child is not in a dangerous condition, and then to figure out
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.680]   what is necessary for the CPS worker to end his or her case and say that it's been fully
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.280]   investigated and there's no problem and no danger there. And that requires a different strategy
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:16.240]   than the basic strategy with law enforcement. That covers what I wanted to cover in today's
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   podcast. I hope it's useful to you. I'll link to a couple of these articles to this book
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.080]   in the show notes. You can read more, you can think more.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:33.680]   Basic principles are the same, but live your life above board. Live in such a way that
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:40.800]   you can always be investigated and not have any problem. But recognize that just because
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.880]   you're living that way today doesn't mean that things can't be there in the future.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.320]   I know many people, and again, I'm not talking to a U.S. audience necessarily here,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.240]   I know many people around the world who are absolute morally upright people who something
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.120]   changes and now their government is enforcing upon them a situation that is different than
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.360]   what it is. And they are now required to stand up for what is morally right, and now what they're
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.120]   doing is legally wrong because they're standing up for what's morally right. It's wonderful if
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.440]   morality and legality are aligned, but it's very rare in the world to have those conditions for
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:25.120]   an enduring period of time. Frequently, morality and legality are crosswise with each other.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.880]   And so you need to be wise in how you negotiate this, and you need to do what is morally right,
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.680]   and also stand up for your legal rights. And recognize that when you go and put your family
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.000]   online, I'm not saying you shouldn't do it. I've wrestled and wrestled and struggled with it,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.040]   and I've just thought, like, it's important. If all of us who, you know, are good parents and
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.560]   loving parents, if those of us who are loving husbands and take care of our family and provide,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.120]   if we just all disappear from the world, then what happens is people are just surrounded by
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:04.640]   stories of wackos and perverts and, you know, jerks and all of that, and then they think that
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   everyone's like that. And in kind of the enormous isolation that we live in, people tend to think
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.480]   that that's normal. It's kind of like the old thing with the news. If all you do is watch the news,
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.600]   then you think there's a murderer behind every tree, but you have to stop and recognize the fact
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.760]   that the reason you think there's a murderer behind every tree is that you're watching the
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.280]   news, and the news is going to always present that which is sensationalistic. So you're not
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.000]   getting an accurate view. Well, the same thing is happening all the time now with social media.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.360]   And so if men like you and I disappear from social media and we're replaced by a bunch of wackos,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.280]   then we have a problem because now other people are just consuming the wackos. So
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:55.520]   I think there are very good reasons for husbands and wives and mothers and fathers who have just
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.960]   normal, healthy families, healthy relationships. I think there's very good reasons for you to put
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.280]   your children online and to create content and things like that. I support it. I really like it
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:14.800]   when normal, well-adjusted people who have family values and are loving spouses and things like
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.960]   that, I really love it when they just create ordinary, normal content because I think that's
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:26.480]   important, but it also comes with a significant risk. So you should expect that if you've got
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:35.280]   600,000 Instagram followers and you're live blogging your travels, that it's not too hard
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.760]   for someone to track you down and call the government on you as kind of an internet debate
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.320]   tactic. It's pretty easy for a wacko on the other side of the country or the other side of the world
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.960]   who doesn't like you and doesn't like how you live to weaponize government. So you need to
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   be prepared for that, which is why I'm trying to create this podcast for you. I hope this
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:02.320]   information is valuable. If it has been, I would ask you for one favor. Go and teach it to somebody
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:10.320]   else. Just make a comment about it with somebody. I find that this kind of advice, most people don't
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.600]   go out looking for it. And frankly, most people aren't interested in it, but still those who need
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:23.600]   it, need it. And so I really try hard to teach people who are likely to interact with the police
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   how to do that. So if someone is poor or somebody is an immigrant or something like that and there's
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.360]   a decent chance that person could be taken advantage of, I always do my best to teach
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.600]   rights. And same thing, teach this to other parents so they understand. Take something here
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.160]   and teach it to someone else so that you can just inspire them to go and look for their own advice.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.480]   Thank you for listening. I'll be back with you soon.
