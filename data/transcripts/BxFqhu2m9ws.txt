[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   I should like to call your attention this evening to one of the paragraphs which we
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.280]   read at the beginning, the paragraph that is to be found in the book of the prophet
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.360]   Isaiah chapter 22 from verse 8 to verse 14. Verses 8 to 14 in the 22nd chapter of the
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.280]   book of the prophet Isaiah. And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.080]   in that day to the armor of the house of the forest. He hath seen also the breaches of
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.200]   the city of David, that there are many. And he gathered together the waters of the lower
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.500]   pool, and he hath numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have he broken down to fortify
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:59.640]   the wall. He made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.680]   he hath not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.840]   it long ago. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.280]   and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth. And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.120]   and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.800]   shall die. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts, Surely this iniquity
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.560]   shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord of hosts.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.440]   I think you will agree with me, having listened to a passage like that, that there is nothing
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.680]   which is quite so remarkable as we read through our Bibles than the way in which now and again,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   indeed very frequently, we come across a passage with a strange contemporary ring about it,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   with an almost exact description of the situation in which we find ourselves. And this is so
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:32.560]   not merely in general, but even down to details and minutiae. Now this is not a kind of mere
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.080]   coincidence. This isn't a sort of accident. This is rarely just an illustration of what
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.820]   the Bible says about itself. Or, if you prefer it, it is an illustration of the great message
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:00.060]   of the Bible. The Bible claims to be the Word of God. The Word of God about himself, the
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.820]   Word of God about man, the Word of God about the world, the Word of God about why the world
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:16.140]   is as it is, and the Word of God as to how the world can be put right. For that is the
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.060]   whole case of the Bible. It claims that it has a unique teaching with respect to the
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.540]   problem of men. And it tells us, right at the very beginning, that men's troubles in
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.660]   this world and in this life, whether you think of men as an individual or men as a great
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.160]   collection of people, the whole world of men and women, the Bible's case is that all this
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.940]   has come upon us because of something that happened at the very beginning, at the very
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:59.500]   dawn of history. The Bible says that men fell from God, they sinned against God, and that
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.980]   as the result of so doing, he is in a state of sin. He says that men, the whole world,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.460]   has been in that condition ever since the fall, and that that is the most important
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:23.820]   and the most significant thing about men that we can ever learn and understand. So, you
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.860]   see, the Bible says that the whole story of men from that first beginning has always been
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.780]   the same. It doesn't matter what changes there may be. The real truth is that men is
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.300]   in a state of sin and alienation from God, and that is the cause of all his troubles
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.900]   and of all his problems. So, whenever you read your Bible, it doesn't matter where you
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.100]   read, in the Old Testament or in the New, whether it's an historical portion, prophetic
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.820]   portion, psalm, it doesn't matter, whether you're reading about one man, whether you're
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.660]   reading about the children of Israel as a nation, you'll find that the story, the message,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:19.420]   is always exactly the same. It is always this story of man in trouble because he is in sin.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:29.340]   And so, you see, it comes to pass that the Bible is always contemporary. It is always
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:37.020]   up to date, for it says that man is still what man has always been ever since that original
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.340]   sin, ever since that first fall in the Garden of Eden. And thus, you see, it comes to pass
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.300]   that as you're reading through your Bible, suddenly you come across a passage and you
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.140]   say, "Well, that might have been written today." It's an exact description of what
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:01.020]   is happening at the present time, precisely, says the Bible. Because all the changes that
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.220]   have taken place in the human race are entirely on the surface. They are mere changes in a
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.340]   sense in appearance and in clothing and in things like that. Man as man quay man remains
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.700]   exactly what he has always been. So as you read the account of an old king in the history
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.620]   of the children of Israel, you're seeing a modern man. As you read of the whole of
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.700]   the children of Israel, you're seeing the modern world.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:36.380]   Now, then, this passage that we're looking at tonight is, I think, just a perfect illustration
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.940]   of what I've just been saying. Mustn't you agree with me when I say that I defy
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:52.660]   you to produce a more accurate, detailed description of the state of mankind in the world tonight
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.180]   than that which we have in these very verses? You see, the Bible is right when it says,
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:06.620]   "There is nothing new under the sun." And so it comes to pass that what we are told
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:14.980]   here of the state of the children of Israel, and especially of the city of Jerusalem, at
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:24.220]   this particular juncture in their history, is an exact portrayal of the world at this
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:32.700]   very moment, this Sunday night in 1956. Very well, let us look at it and see what it has
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:40.540]   to tell us. Here, I say, is the word of God to men this evening. This is the word of God
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.020]   to any individual who is in trouble or distress in this congregation. It is the word of God
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:54.340]   to the whole world tonight, immersed and involved as it is in all these alarms and trials and
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:01.860]   troubles, wars and rumors of wars, and the horrible possibility of yet worse things to
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:08.460]   come. Let us then, I say, listen to it and pray God that he will give us his grace and
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:16.660]   his Spirit to take this message unto ourselves individually and to ourselves as citizens
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:23.260]   of the world in which we live. What is the picture? Well, the picture is introduced by
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:31.860]   this remarkable phrase at the beginning of verse 8, "And he discovered the covering
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.340]   of Judah." What does he mean by that? Well, it means this. You might translate it like
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:48.340]   this, "He has taken away the covering of Judah." He has taken away, in other words,
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:54.980]   the covering that was over the eyes of the people of Judah. They had got a kind of veil
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.460]   before their eyes so that they could not see certain things. But now, says the prophet,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:07.860]   the covering has been taken away and they are suddenly beginning to see certain things.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.860]   How had the covering been taken away? Well, the answer is already given in the early part
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:21.260]   of the chapter and the whole context and the contemporary history. Here it was. An Assyrian
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.740]   army had entered the land of the children of Israel. It had occupied certain parts of
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:38.100]   the land already. It was now advancing in the direction of the city of Jerusalem. And
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:45.220]   it was that fact that had awakened these people. It was that fact that had taken the covering
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:52.260]   from off their eyes and had forced them to look at the situation and to recognize certain
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:10:01.980]   things. Before that, you see, they had been thoughtless and heedless, not paying any attention
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.540]   at all. Certain people amongst them had been trying to call them to their senses a prophet
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.620]   like this and other prophets, but they wouldn't listen. They said, "Everything's all right.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.220]   Don't bother us. Don't trouble us. Everything's going all right." The covering was over their
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.060]   eyes, but now with the advance of the Assyrian army, suddenly the covering is taken away
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.300]   and they are aware that something's wrong and they begin to think and to consider and
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:36.100]   to face the facts. How typical. What a perfect description of this present century. What
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:44.060]   an exact description it is of the late Victorian era and especially the Edwardian era. Indeed,
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.320]   what a perfect description it is of what happened in the 1930s between the two wars, the two
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.500]   world wars. "Everything's all right. Why? Things have never been better in a sense,"
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.100]   people said. Oh, I'm never tired of repeating this. You know, it's the whole essence of
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:10.100]   the gospel message today, that fatal optimism. The Victorians were perfectly satisfied in
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.580]   their lives that everything in the world was perfect. It could scarcely be more perfect.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:20.140]   "Oh, yes," they said, "it can. It'll be still better in the 20th century." Science,
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.100]   venturing, developing, knowledge, growing. Why, what was there left but to enjoy the
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.500]   golden era that was about to come? "Everything's all right," they said. And if anybody ventured
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.660]   to suggest that everything was not all right, he was dismissed as a pessimist. Man was inevitably
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:45.140]   going on towards perfection. I say that even after the First World War, people still continue
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:51.020]   to say that everything was all right. Go back, those of you who are old enough to do so,
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.300]   and consider the mentality of the twenties and the thirties. Even after the rise of Hitler,
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.940]   people said, "No, no, it can't happen. You don't get two world wars within a quarter
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.260]   of a century. These things can't happen." The veil, the covering was there, and they
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:20.540]   couldn't see. And it's been the same even after this last world war. This fatal complacency,
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:26.580]   this refusal to recognize what was happening in the world. Very well, but here are people
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.300]   at last. The covering is taken away. They're bound to face it. Isn't something like that
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.960]   happening to us, I wonder? Have not the events of the last month taken the covering away
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.020]   from the eyes of every person who's capable of thinking at all? Are we not being forced
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:50.500]   to ask certain serious, vital, ultimate questions? What's the matter? Very well, the covering
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.900]   has been taken away. Well then, what did they discover when the covering was taken away?
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.460]   We are told in the ninth verse, "Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David,
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.260]   that there are many." The covering having been taken away, being forced by the events
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.860]   of the Assyrian army, they begin to look at and to examine the wall, the defensive wall
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.260]   that surrounded the city of David. And for the first time they discovered that there
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.380]   were many breaches and many holes in the wall. They'd never seen them before, but now they
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:30.860]   discover that there are many breaches in the walls. Let's be clear about this. It wasn't
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.820]   the Assyrian army that had made the breaches. The Assyrian army had not yet reached the
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:41.460]   city of Jerusalem. Why are there breaches in the walls then? Here's the answer. Simply
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:47.740]   because of the complacency and the indolence and the slackness of the children of Judah,
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:54.620]   the citizens of Jerusalem. They were enjoying themselves and having a good time. They didn't
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.940]   inspect their walls, they didn't examine them, they didn't make sure that everything was
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.380]   all right. Occasionally a mason or a foreman would come and say, "Look here, it seems to
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.500]   me that you need to repoint the walls at certain points. Don't be alarmist," they said. "Let's
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.660]   go on having a good time. Don't talk about need of pointing." And so they'd neglected
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.740]   it, they'd ignored it, they'd allowed things to go on, the mortar to crumble, and at last
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.020]   you see the bricks and the stones had collapsed and there was actually a hole, a breach in
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:31.460]   the wall. Sheer negligence, nothing else. This fatal complacency that says everything's
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:41.540]   all right, there's no need to be worried or to be an alarmist. Am I not still describing
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:49.580]   the modern situation? Isn't this the fatal complacency that has been so true of us in
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:58.020]   this country? Isn't this the way in which this country, which was once a religious country,
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:06.260]   has become an irreligious country? Isn't it entirely due to this slow, subtle process
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:12.140]   that goes on almost unobserved and we will not listen to and people, when they call our
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:20.260]   attention to it, are dismissed? That's how it happens. The walls of Jerusalem at those
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.820]   points didn't suddenly collapse. No, no, it was a very slow, insidious process, but
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.420]   it had gone on almost imperceptibly from day to day, and at last there's a collapse and
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:40.020]   there's a hole. That's how it always works. That's how it happens in the life of a nation.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.260]   The great Roman Empire didn't suddenly collapse. It was a very slow process that undermined
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   its health and its strength, its vigour and its life. And it's been the same with every
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.980]   great empire and every great nation. It was always the trouble with the children of Israel.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:04.580]   But my dear friends, it's exactly the same in the life of every individual. No man suddenly
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:11.300]   goes wrong and all to pieces. It's a very subtle, it's a very slow process, this. He
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:18.420]   just starts by being a little bit slack here and there. "It's all right," he says, "nothing's
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:24.020]   wrong." Just forgets to say his prayers, which he was taught to say by his parents.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.900]   Just forgets now and again. Nothing in it, of course not. Just begins to play with drink.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.300]   "Oh, just one drink, of course he's not going to be a drunkard." No, no, just a little
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.820]   bit of moral slackness. And it comes in, and you see it's imperceptible, you don't know
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.380]   it. Somebody else says, "Look here, do you know where you're going? What's happening
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.500]   to you? You're not as faithful as you were to your prayers and to your church and to
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.860]   your Bible. Don't you think you're playing with fire? Don't be an alarmist," you say,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.180]   "Don't be silly. I know what I'm doing. I'm well aware of where I am, and I'm in control
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:01.140]   of myself." That's how you speak, isn't it? And you know nothing about it until there's
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.780]   an actual breach in the wall. You've suddenly lost your chastity or your purity. You've
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.940]   suddenly lost your character. Something precious and vital has suddenly gone. That's how it
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.900]   happens. It isn't the enemy coming in and smashing it down. No, no, it's your indolence,
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.380]   complacency, negligence on our part, and these things happen, and suddenly we are confronted
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.380]   by the situation. Something happens, and we are awakened and have to wake up and rub our
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:38.820]   eyes, and we discover the troubles, the advance of the Syrian army. Oh, I say, isn't it happening
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:46.460]   today? Are we not all at last beginning to be aware that there's something wrong with
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:53.740]   men, something wrong in the world? The events of the last month, I say, must surely have
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:59.740]   awakened us. Ah, yes, that's all right. That's very good. But the vital question arises just
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:07.620]   at that point. What are the children of Israel going to do about this? What did they do about
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:17.620]   it? And the answer is that it was just here they went tragically wrong. And it was because
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.620]   of their tragic failure at that very point that the prophet addresses this message to
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.740]   them. It was because of their tragic failure that eventually they were conquered, and their
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:35.700]   city was razed to the ground and destroyed, and they were carried away captives into the
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:43.860]   captivity of Babylon. Now then, here is God's message to them to prevent that calamity.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:50.860]   And my friends, here is God's message to us tonight to prevent the same calamity. Let's
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:59.420]   look at it individually for a moment. Every one of us is like this city of Jerusalem.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.700]   Every one of us is under the eye of God. Every one of us in this world is determining an
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:13.660]   eternal destiny. The whole vital matter for us therefore this evening is this. If we have
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.340]   discovered that things are not well with us, if we have any reason for being concerned
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:24.260]   about our lives and feel that we've gone wrong or gone to pieces in certain respects and
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.780]   want to be right, well then I say the most important thing for us to discover is what
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:36.220]   have we got to do. And the same applies to this nation. The same applies to all the nations
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:45.380]   and to the whole world of men. Very well, I say, what do we observe? Well, we are told
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:54.980]   here first and foremost of the frantic and the futile attempts of the children of Israel
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:02.180]   to deal with their problem. Did you notice it? I tried to bring it out in the reading.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.900]   You have seen also the breaches of the city of David that are many. And what did you do
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:17.420]   about it? Listen. Ye gather together the waters of the lower pool, ye have numbered the houses
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:23.700]   of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify them all. Ye have also made
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:33.500]   a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool. Now let's look at this. Here
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.740]   they are, you see the advance of the Assyrian army has at last taken up the veil. They are
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.140]   wide awake, they say we are in a desperate position. And you see the breaches in the
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.620]   wall. What can we do about it? And they began to get really busy and active. They entered
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.460]   into a great bustling activity. You notice they first of all went to that armory in the
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.220]   forest, the place they kept their implements of war, their chariots, their horses, and
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.020]   the various implements that they then used in making war with one another. They rushed
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.260]   to their village arsenal, if you like, and to all their arsenals, and saw what they had
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:12.820]   got there, and added to them, and made great military preparations. But they didn't stop
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.660]   at that, you see, they did something with these waterworks and this water supply, and
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.620]   they were even going to use that as a matter of defense. And then they did a most heroic
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.260]   thing, they began numbering every single house in Jerusalem, and then they sent round the
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.540]   experts and said, well now look here, we haven't got stones to build up the breaches. No reserves,
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:39.660]   you see. Not being aware of what was happening to the wall, they hadn't got bricks and stones,
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.260]   and everything that was necessary. So they now become desperate and they say, what can
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:51.140]   we do? So they numbered every house and inspected every house in Jerusalem, and then they decided
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.780]   the only thing to do was that some of those houses had got to be pulled down in order
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.100]   that they might have the bricks and the stones to repair the breaches in the wall. Some people
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.660]   would be called upon to sacrifice their homes and their houses in order to defend the whole
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.420]   city. And they pulled down certain houses and they repaired the breaches. Here they
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:15.540]   are, and then this pool between the two walls. Tremendous excitement and activity and bustle
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:25.620]   and business trying to save the situation lest the enemy may come in. You notice the
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:32.820]   number of things they did? You notice the variety of things they did? You notice the
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:41.340]   heroic methods which they adopted? What a perfect description it is once more of this
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:52.340]   present century in which you and I live. Never has man been quite so busy in trying to repair
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:59.860]   the breaches in his life as during this present century. Never has there been so much busyness
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:08.900]   and bustle and organizing and planning as during this present century. All designed,
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.900]   as was the case with the children of Israel, to stop the rot and to build up the breaches
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.220]   and somehow or another to save civilization against the threat that was coming ever nearer
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.020]   to it. That's the picture.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.060]   May I remind you of some of the heroics in which we have indulged as the children of
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:35.660]   Israel indulged? Think of all the political measures. Think of them here in our own country,
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:42.420]   home politics. Think of the acts of Parliament we have passed in order to try to save the
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:48.060]   situation. Think of all that we have done in international politics, League of Nations,
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:55.940]   United Nations organization, conferences, meetings, everything conceivable, UNESCO,
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.540]   bringing people together, solving certain problems together. Has the world ever been
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.500]   as busy as it is at the present time and as it has been during the whole of this present
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   century? You pick up the biographies of statesmen who lived a hundred years ago and more and
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:23.460]   oh how leisurely their lives seemed to be. Parliament used to have tremendous long vacations,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.300]   ministers were away for months, what a leisurely life it was. And look at the busyness of this
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:34.700]   present century, bustling and bustling, getting this pool ready, pulling down houses, getting
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.660]   that waterway into position, rushing to the armory. Never has man, I say, been so busy
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:48.300]   in a political sense trying to save the world. Then think of it in terms of education, the
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:56.740]   social effort as well as the political. Look at all the money that is being spent on education
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:04.020]   in all the countries. Why even in my lifetime I have seen it developing and increasing in
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:10.620]   an almost incredible manner. I remember the time when we had first of all the directors
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:16.100]   of education in counties. They have now got assistants and those who organise further
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:23.260]   education and sub this and sub that. The whole thing has become a mammoth organisation and
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.740]   we are spending millions of pounds upon it, all in an attempt to build up the bridges
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:37.700]   in the wall and somehow to save our civilisation. Housing and all sorts of councils and conferences,
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.980]   marriage guidance councils, everything is being organised. You know they didn't have
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.540]   things like that in the past but now everything is being organised. We are aware, you see,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.300]   of the social problem and we say it must be dealt with. And indeed there are men who set
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.500]   up these things and then we find they are in the divorce courts themselves, the experts
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.380]   on how to get married and how to save marriages. We are working day and night in all directions
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.900]   somehow trying to save the situation, the bustle and the business of the children of
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:15.140]   Israel of old. And then all the talking and the writing about the application of the Christian
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:21.220]   ethic that that's all that's needed. And if only we all adopted the pacifist situation
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.460]   there'd be no more war and everything would be absolutely perfect. There it is. These
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:31.260]   are the methods and then the economic ones on top of that. It's finally an economic
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:36.380]   problem says certain schools of thought. And if only you can put these right and make these
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.620]   adjustments everything will be put right. And we've done that but still the problem
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:47.300]   remains and then the military, the money we are spending on armaments and so on and so
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:52.820]   forth. Well I mustn't keep you with these details. All I'm concerned to show you is
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:00.900]   this. That though these children of Israel had done all those things and had indulged
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:07.740]   in those heroic methods in an attempt to save their city, it completely failed. It was frantic
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:14.980]   but it was equally futile. And I am here tonight to tell you in the name of God and to remind
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:20.900]   you that everything we have done as men in this present century has been equally frantic
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:29.620]   and equally futile. Our world tonight is proving it. The nations have never been so highly
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.220]   educated as they are tonight. Never have we organized every department of life so perfectly.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.420]   Yet look at the facts. Look at the breaches. Look at the enemy that's advancing. Why does
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:49.540]   all this fail? Listen to this answer. All the heroic methods came to nothing and failed
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:58.660]   completely. First, because these people, even when the covering had been taken off from
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:10.100]   their eyes, could not see still the real character of their problem. What did they fail to see?
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:21.220]   Well, they failed to see, first of all, the moral character of their problem. To them,
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.420]   you see, it was purely a military problem. They never saw that it had a moral aspect
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:34.220]   at all. As far as they could understand and see it, it was just a question of these breaches
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.540]   in the wall and making use of that armory and supplementing it and getting everything
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:44.020]   ready so that you could meet the army when it came. They never realized that it was essentially
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:53.420]   a moral problem. Where's that? Well, that's the message of verse 13. In spite of what
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:29:02.700]   God tells them in calling them to repentance, this is what happened. "Behold joy and gladness,
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:09.980]   slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. Let us eat and drink, for
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:18.220]   tomorrow we die." What's it mean? Well, let me divide it for you in this way. The
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:25.660]   first thing that was so tragically wrong about these people was that even the situation to
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:33.900]   which they had become awakened did not make them serious. In spite of the desperate character
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:44.820]   of their plight, I say they are still light-hearted, flippant, and still feeling confident and
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:56.940]   assured. "Joy and gladness. Let us eat and drink." You know this book's a remarkable
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.500]   book, isn't it, the Bible? Is there anyone who can listen to things like this and still
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.460]   not believe that the Bible is the word of God? This is just an exact description of
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.580]   what's happening today. We are awakened, we are disturbed. This business in Egypt,
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.020]   this business in Hungary, and the other possibilities, we are aware that something's wrong. All
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.780]   right, it's on the front page of the newspaper, I know, but side by side with it on the front
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:33.220]   page is the endless series of photographs of these women and their married relationships
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:40.380]   as if it mattered to anybody or ever mattered at any time. When the world is on the verge
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:47.780]   of a third world war, perhaps, we must know about all these filthy details of these immoral
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:59.380]   livers on the front pages. We are still not serious. Though we've passed through two
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:07.100]   world wars, you can't read your newspapers without getting all this trivial nonsense
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:19.140]   and still, side by side with the serious, is the flippant and the carefree. The press
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:28.460]   of this country shows still a fundamental lack of seriousness. But that isn't the
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:36.220]   whole truth about this moral failure. The flippancy and the carefree attitude, of course,
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:44.900]   is entirely due to something else, and that is the love of ease and the love of pleasure.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.860]   Though the enemy is advancing, though the breaches are in the wall, though they haven't
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.500]   got their reserves and are having to pull down houses and do things like that in order
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.340]   to save the situation, still you see this is the position, joy and gladness, slaying
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:07.780]   oxen, killing sheep, eating flesh, drinking wine, let us eat and drink. Nothing must be
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:14.140]   allowed to disturb our pleasure, not even a war. Even the last war wasn't allowed
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.540]   to disturb our pleasure. Oh no, we must still allow a drink, you know. There are many things
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   we can go without and did have to go without them, not without drink. I could prove that
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:31.820]   to you from statistics. Not without our pleasure, not without our sex, not without that kind
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.500]   of entertainment coming over the wireless. Nothing must disturb our pleasure. The things
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:42.220]   we like and the things that we enjoy, that must always go on, and that's the reason
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.860]   why we refuse to be serious.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:54.220]   Did you realize, my friend, that the industrial problems confronting this country today are
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:01.860]   ultimately moral problems? They're not economic problems, they're moral problems.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.060]   Whatever they may do about this business in Suez, I can tell you this, the papers are
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.340]   saying it, the economists are all telling us this thing, the whole future of this country
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:19.900]   is in jeopardy. I don't mean in a military sense, I mean in an economic sense. And why
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:29.140]   is it in jeopardy? Oh, I say, it's for moral reasons. It's the love of ease and the love
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:43.660]   of pleasure. It's this new false wrong attitude towards work. And it applies on every side.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:51.180]   The owners, the managers, the masters are as guilty as the workmen. Let's be quite
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:58.780]   clear about this. Sin is no respecter of persons, as God is no respecter of persons. And this
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:08.020]   moral rot is running right through the whole of society.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:15.460]   There are so many owners in industry whose chief ambition is not to do a good day's
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:22.300]   work, but to be called gentry. Their idea is to use their business in order that they
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.260]   may be gentlemen. They're interested in fox hunting and things like that. They're
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:34.700]   not interested in their works as such. It was they who began the long weekend habit
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:41.980]   and started the five-day week. There it is, you see, amongst them, but it's equally
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:48.420]   true amongst the working classes. They are simply repeating what they have seen the others
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.940]   doing. They say, "If the owner can afford only to work five days a week, why should
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:35:00.660]   I work more than five days a week? If he must have his cigars, why shouldn't I have
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:07.060]   my cigarettes? If he must have his wine and his expensive drinks, why shouldn't I have
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.420]   my beer?" Perfectly fair argument. It's the same, you see, all along the line, from
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:20.580]   top to bottom. Work is a nuisance. And the only value of industry is that it provides
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.780]   money, that we can all buy food and drink and have a good time and enjoy ourselves.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.660]   So whatever may be the position of the country, "I must still go fox hunting," says one,
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.740]   "I must watch that football match midweek," says the other. And here they are, all of
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.700]   them, are neglecting their work, and the whole country may be in jeopardy. It's a moral
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.780]   problem. The problem of this country industrially today is not an economic one. It isn't a
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:53.620]   social one. It's a moral problem. The attitude of men towards work is absolutely wrong. It's
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:36:04.020]   a nuisance and merely a means of providing money. This love of ease and of pleasure.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:10.780]   And then you notice the fatalism that always accompanies this. "Let us eat and drink,"
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:19.220]   they say, "for tomorrow we die." What's the use of anything? That's the modern man, isn't
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:27.140]   it? He's an orthosynic, he's in absolute despair. He says, "What's the use of anything?
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.020]   We all may be dead if that bomb's used, we're finished. Very well, in the meantime, let's
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:40.900]   have a good time, let us eat and drink." Absolute fatalism and despair. Oh, you see, these children
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:49.860]   of Israel so long ago had not realized the moral character of their problem. But still
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:57.300]   more important and still more serious, they had not realized the religious character of
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:06.460]   their problem. Listen to this. "They've indulged in their heroic methods, but ye have not looked
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:13.900]   unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago." Oh,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:20.220]   they run to the armory, they run to the pools, they run to the walls and pull down houses,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.740]   they run everywhere, here and there. But there's one thing they never did. They never looked
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:35.660]   up, they never looked to God. They never realized that it was ultimately a religious problem.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:44.100]   In other words, the whole story of the tragedy of the children of Israel is just this. They
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:53.060]   forgot God, and they forgot that they were God's people. They forgot that it was God
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.820]   who'd given them the land, who'd made them a nation, it was God who'd given them the
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.740]   city and had given them every blessing and every victory that they'd enjoyed. They forgot
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:11.980]   that. They had a wrong view of God and a wrong view of themselves. And it's as true tonight
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:19.940]   as it was of those children of Israel of old. Are the present calamities really causing
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:26.980]   people to turn to God and to think of him? Are they even causing men and women to get
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:36.420]   a right and a true view of themselves as men, as man? My dear friends, this is the ultimate
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:46.660]   solution to the whole problem. Man is not an independent creature, an autonomous creature
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:56.940]   who can manage his own affairs. Man is a creature made by God, fashioned by God in his own image,
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:11.620]   long ago, as the city of Jerusalem had been. And man has been made by God and for God.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.340]   And he can only function truly as long as he's obedient to the law of his nature, the
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:23.100]   law of his being. That's why the world is in trouble, because man doesn't know the
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:29.180]   truth about himself. He doesn't know that he can ever be successful and happy and prosperous
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.980]   unless he is being blessed by God. He will tackle his problem economically, politically,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.340]   socially, educationally, and in a thousand and one ways, but until he realizes that he's
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:49.140]   made for God and dependent upon God, all will be in vain, because he is a creature of God.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:56.740]   And he'll never succeed without the blessing of God. It is this fatal failure, I say, to
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:07.300]   realize that the problem is a moral problem and that the problem is a religious problem.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:15.660]   And then the third thing that they failed to realize was this one. The profound and
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:23.860]   the radical character of the problem. You see, the children of Israel were always thinking
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.940]   that though there was a trouble, it was a very little trouble. They were always listening
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.260]   to the prophets who said, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace. "Ah, they said there's
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.940]   something wrong, but you needn't be an alarmist. You mustn't try and frighten us. There's
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.020]   just a little wrong, but we'll soon put it right." They'd never realized the radical
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.340]   character, the profound character. Listen to these men putting it in these wonderful
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:53.100]   terms. "You've done all this," he says, "but you have not looked unto the Maker thereof,
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:01.900]   nor had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago." What's he mean?
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:12.100]   Well, shall I put it to you as a simple illustration? The problem of men, as he is in the world
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:20.740]   today, I say, is a very profound, a very radical, a very deep, a very great problem. Look at
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:32.340]   it like this. Think of a man driving a motor car. Often in his experience something or
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:38.260]   another has gone wrong. He's got out and he's lifted up the bonnet of his car. He
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.420]   just sees a connection loose. He screws it tightly again. Off goes the car. Again it
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.300]   stops. "Oh, it's just a little plug that needs a bit of cleaning." Off she goes again
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.980]   perfectly. And on and on he goes. Another accident. He can't deal with it this time.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:57.020]   Turns into the nearest garage. In a few seconds the mechanic puts it right. Happens again.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:03.780]   "Ah, just the same again." Then a day comes. He has another stop. And he says, "All right,
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   I'll see if I can put this right." He tries, but he fails. Goes into the nearest garage.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   Well, the man there does his best. He can't do it. The local garage is no longer. He says,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.260]   "You need something further. Try that." "No." And then the man comes to him and
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:23.660]   says, "I'm sorry to have to tell you. Your car is hopelessly broken down. There's only
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:33.980]   one thing to do with it. It must be sent back to the makers. You want a new engine. You
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:40.620]   must go back to the original fashioner. You yourself, the local mechanic, the local garage,
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:48.540]   no longer adequate. Back to the maker. Back to the works. Something radical, something
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:55.500]   altogether profound, something essentially new is needed." That's what this man is
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.620]   saying. Your heroic methods and your tinkering with the walls, even though you pull down
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:10.580]   houses and sacrifice, isn't going to deal with it. You must go back to your maker. Which
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:18.620]   being interpreted and put in modern form, I can put like this to you. The trouble with
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:26.460]   men in sin is not a problem that can be settled by acts of Parliament, nor by education and
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:38.180]   culture, nor by economics and social measures and all your societies and organizations.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:45.140]   For men's trouble is in his own nature. It's in his heart. And it is as wrong and as hopeless
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:51.820]   and as vile as this, that he cannot be improved. He cannot be put right by just a little adjustment
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:58.820]   here or there. He must go back to his maker. He's got to go back to God. He needs to be
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:07.300]   made anew. He needs a new engine, a new nature. He needs to be made a new man. And nothing
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.380]   short of that will ever meet the situation. But this is the thing that the children of
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:18.620]   Israel never realized, and they went to captivity. Mother man isn't realizing it, or he wouldn't
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:27.660]   still trust to his own expedience and his own devices. He doesn't realize the profound
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:41.140]   character of his problem. And on top of that, of course, is his tragic blindness to the
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:50.220]   doom that awaits him if he continues as he is. That's verse 14. Listen. "And it was revealed
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:45:03.100]   in mine ears by the Lord God of hosts, 'Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:16.060]   till ye die,' saith the Lord God of hosts." God had spoken to these children of Israel
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:21.780]   and had called them to repentance. In that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:28.020]   and to mourning and to boldness and to girding with sackcloth. What was their response? Behold,
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:44.260]   joy and gladness, we couldn't care less. Who's God? Who's God to a modern man who's so brilliant
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:54.020]   that he can split atoms? Who's God to a modern man with all his education, sob-stuffed tripe?
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:46:02.260]   Christ? Suitable for an oath or a cursor to be spat upon. You're Christ and you're blood,
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:15.380]   says the modern man. I've outgrown such rubbish. Joy and gladness, slaying oxen, killing sheep,
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:26.380]   eating flesh and drinking wine. Let us eat and drink, that's the response. And it's all
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:43.220]   because he doesn't realize that this is God's world, that God has made this world, that
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:55.460]   God is the Lord God of hosts, who's brought the whole cosmos into being out of nothing,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:04.820]   who can smash an army by blowing upon it, who can raise kings and pull them down again.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:11.620]   The Lord God of hosts. The modern man says religion is played out, Christianity is old
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.340]   fashioned. He couldn't care less, he's not interested, and he's talking about the God
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:29.260]   in whose hand his breath is and whose are all his ways. We've all got to meet this God.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:36.300]   You can't escape him, you can't evade him. He's made you. You're in his world, he can
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:41.620]   take your breath out of you just like that, he doesn't know he's done it. And you will
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:49.100]   certainly stand before him in the judgment. These people scoffed at him, but his word
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:56.020]   came true, was verified, and they were ruined and destroyed and carried away. And man is
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:09.740]   facing God in judgment. Very well then, what can we do? It's all here and it's perfectly
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:19.900]   simple. We have nothing to do but to listen to the word of God, and this is the word.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:29.660]   In that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:41.340]   to girding with sackcloth. What's he mean? He means repentance, my friends, a true repentance.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:45.780]   He doesn't just mean that when things are desperate you have a national day of prayer.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.980]   He doesn't mean that when things are very bad that the great of the land go to a service
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:54.140]   in Westminster Abbey and nobody can remember when they were seen in a place of worship
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:49:07.820]   before. He doesn't mean that. He means that we begin to realize that we are what we are
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:16.540]   and our world is as it is because we've forgotten him, because we've desecrated and broken his
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:27.980]   holy laws, because we are proud and arrogant and mad and drunk with our own self-importance.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.940]   It means that we realize that we are going to die and stand before him, and having had
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:37.300]   a glimpse of his holiness and his law and having seen the truth about ourselves, we
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:44.500]   become alarmed and terrified and we begin to weep and to mourn and tear our hair out
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:50.060]   and shave our heads as an expression of our grief, that we take off our gaudy clothing
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:59.340]   and give up our love of ease and pleasure and put on sackcloth and ashes, that we humble
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:09.580]   ourselves under the mighty, almighty hand of God and plead his pardon and his forgiveness,
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:15.340]   that we surrender our lives entirely unto him, that we go to him and acknowledge it
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:20.380]   all and say, "What wouldst thou have us to do?" And he will tell us, "Believe on the
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.860]   name of my only begotten Son. I've sent him into your world because it is as it is, and
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:31.140]   he alone can save it. I've sent him. He's done the work. He has died for you and for
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:37.660]   your sins. Give yourself to him. Receive his salvation. Submit yourselves to him and let
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:45.620]   him make you anew. Recognize your need of a new life, a new start, a new nature, a new
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:52.820]   heart, a new beginning. Ask him for the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit, entire submission
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:58.940]   and surrender, and then get up and walk in obedience to his laws. Let the world laugh
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:04.660]   at you. Say, "This is God's way. It's the only hope. It's the only way to save us from
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.820]   disaster."
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:20.780]   You repent and acknowledge and confess your sin to God and obey him when he tells you
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:28.940]   to believe in his Son who has died for you and your sins and to follow him whatever the
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:42.140]   cost. And you will find yourself saved. You will find yourself at peace with God, with
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:50.740]   a new life, a new nature, with a new outlook upon everything. The fear of death will go
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:52:01.700]   and the fear of the judgment will go. Having gone back to the maker, to the fashioner and
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   designer, you will find yourself a new man.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   I am speaking to you individually. Nations do not turn to Christ together, but individuals
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:28.660]   do. And as individuals do in large numbers, nations are influenced. Start with yourself
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:39.340]   therefore and then tell others. Are there breaches in the wall of your life? Haven't
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:46.860]   you lost something very precious in this world? Aren't you ashamed in your heart of hearts?
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:53.820]   Don't you like to be whole, to be holy, to be clean, to be true, and to be able to
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:59.980]   see through life, through death, and to know God and enjoy him? I say there is only one
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:06.820]   way. Go back to him.
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:14.500]   And as masses of people shall do so, so the moral and the social and the economic and
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:26.740]   the industrial and all the other problems will begin to be solved. This is the Word
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:42.820]   of God. What you need, what we all need, is your maker, your redeemer. Fly to him. Amen.
