[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Oh, well, let's just roll on.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   Larry has the next one.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.760]   Larry says, "Hi, Professor Newport.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.040]   I loved your book, 'So Good They Can't Ignore You,'
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.640]   but it seems to me that only a small minority of people
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.480]   can possess rare and valuable skills at any given time.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.940]   Does this mean only a minority of people can succeed
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.880]   in achieving the ideal laid out in your book?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.560]   If not, what would a world where most people
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320]   are so good they can't be ignored look like?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.960]   Thank you very much for your time."
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.520]   Good question, Larry.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.440]   It allows me to clarify something.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.640]   Yes, the big idea in my 2012 book,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700]   "Be So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.240]   is that you should build what I called
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   rare and valuable skills.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.920]   Use those as leverage then to take control of your career,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680]   move it towards things that resonate
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.520]   and away from things that don't.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.200]   More recently, I might talk about that
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   as use that leverage to get closer to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.560]   Same idea.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   So Larry is saying,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.680]   well, how many people can really have
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   rare and valuable skills?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.200]   How many people are gonna be a world-class writer
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.600]   or mathematician or something like this?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   And this is an important clarification.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.500]   Your definition, Larry, what you're thinking of
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.840]   when you think of rare and valuable skills is too broad,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.580]   too strict, I should say.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.980]   When you're thinking rare and valuable skills,
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.480]   you're thinking at large scales of competition,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.960]   rather, that you're the best.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.460]   That's way too strict and ambitious.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.680]   When I say rare and valuable skills,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980]   I mean, you can do something for your employer
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.000]   that is valuable to your employer,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.160]   and they don't have a lot of other people
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.700]   who can do that for them right now.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.760]   So the scope for rare and valuable skills
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200]   is your employment situation.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.100]   So everyone can have rare and valuable skills
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.460]   that give them leverage.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.360]   I mean, let's get concrete.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.980]   Let's say you went to college,
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.500]   you have an entry-level job,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200]   you're working at a communications non-profit
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.680]   outside of Boston,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.280]   you have your fancy degree,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.080]   but you're starting at an entry-level job.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.860]   You're basically, they'll call you an associate,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.240]   but you're kind of like an assistant
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.380]   to someone who's higher up.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.000]   You're helping organize projects
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and trips that they work on, something like this, right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   A very standard sort of entry-level job.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.640]   What would rare and valuable skills mean right there?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.240]   Well, you are reliable.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   You accomplish the things you say you're gonna accomplish.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   You're organized.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.200]   You learn and understand whatever it is
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.060]   that the people you assist do,
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600]   so you can make their life easier.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.340]   Maybe they work with a particular,
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.740]   and I'm thinking about an actual person,
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.580]   actual job here.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.740]   This is actually a job my wife had out of college.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.020]   So I'm using this as an example,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.500]   but let's say they work with a particular tour provider.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.020]   They would take teachers on tours.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.220]   Getting to learn how that tour operator works
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.220]   and the people over there, that's all valuable.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.100]   That's very valuable to this employer.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.020]   And they don't have other people who can do this for him.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.460]   They could try to hire someone else,
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.820]   but they don't know if they're gonna be good or not.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.660]   That gives you leverage.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.740]   Now you're able to move up.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.300]   You have leverage over what you wanna do
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.260]   and what you don't wanna do,
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.900]   and you can start moving up in that job.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.180]   You move up to the next level, you do that next level well.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.540]   You get good at it.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.220]   You master elements of it that are specific to the job.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.060]   Other people don't do it as well as you, and you move up.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.880]   So what I'm trying to say, Larry, is rare and valuable
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.460]   is relative to the employer,
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.340]   or if you're self-employed,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.620]   relevant to your specific clients.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.980]   Everyone can build rare and valuable skills
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.700]   in their particular context.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   That career capital is leverage.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.740]   Use that leverage to keep moving your job closer and closer
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.460]   to supporting the lifestyle that you desire.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.780]   (upbeat music)
