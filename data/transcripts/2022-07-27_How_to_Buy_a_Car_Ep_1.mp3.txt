[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.760]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.640]   My name is Josh Rasheeds, I'm your host, and today I'm going to explain to you how to buy
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.880]   a car.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.840]   This question will be answered in a series of episodes.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.840]   We'll talk first today about whether you should buy a car.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.480]   We'll talk about ways to think about the kind of car you should buy.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.240]   Then we'll move on to systems of negotiation, how to finance a car or not finance a car,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.720]   how to get a good deal on a new car, how to get a good deal on a used car, how to decide
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   whether you should lease a car, buy a car, etc.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.040]   But today we begin with the foundational question in how to buy a car, which is simply ask yourself,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.360]   should I buy a car?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:00.960]   One of the thinking tools that is best cultivated in our lives is always, is this even necessary?
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.140]   For example, in productivity training, one of the first lessons that you learn in productivity
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.040]   training is to ask the question, is this necessary?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.140]   Before you set up a system to do something efficiently, ask yourself if it's even necessary
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.720]   or useful.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.200]   Many many people confuse efficiency with effectiveness and their personal productivity.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.920]   They go through life doing things with excellence that don't need to be done at all.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.740]   So when you're sitting and looking at a list of tasks, things to do, one of the first things
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060]   you should ask yourself is, which of these can I simply eliminate?
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960]   Before I go through and figure out how to delegate this task to another person, before
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.560]   I go through my list and try to create a system for handling this task in a more efficient
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.600]   way or with more advanced tools, can I simply eliminate the task?
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.280]   What are the consequences for eliminating the task?
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.480]   And this level of addressing or thinking about the consequences is important.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.540]   And we're going to talk about the consequences of owning or not owning a car in a moment.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.200]   Many tasks can be eliminated from someone's to-do list with zero negative consequences.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.900]   But we usually eliminate those things fairly automatically.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.040]   We naturally procrastinate on those tasks.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.200]   There are other tasks that we can eliminate, but there's going to be a cost.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.520]   And one of the skills of personal productivity has to do with learning to understand the
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.760]   actual costs of eliminating a task and being willing to accept the cost if it's low enough.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.440]   Back to cars.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.880]   The question to ask in how to buy a car is, at the very beginning, do I need to buy a
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.920]   car or do I want to buy a car?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.080]   I want to talk about this from a financial perspective and also from a lifestyle perspective.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.000]   There's no question that for most people, the answer to these questions is automatically
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.640]   yes.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.000]   For example, I both need and want to own a car.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   I have not established my lifestyle in such a way that I live easily without a car.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.120]   This is due to simply my family.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.720]   When you have children, cars are way better than virtually every other option.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840]   It's also simply due to the lifestyle that I want to live and the kind of freedom that
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360]   I like to have.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   Having ready transportation where I'm not dependent upon a chauffeur, where I'm not
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.480]   dependent upon a commercial service of some kind is for me a great advantage.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   I like the lifestyle benefits of having a vehicle and of being able to use a vehicle
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.880]   whenever I want to.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.420]   However, there are a lot of lifestyle benefits that could be accrued by someone in a different
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.920]   situation than my own where the lifestyle benefits of not owning a car are much more
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   substantial.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.600]   Let's begin, of course, on a personal finance podcast with a brief discussion of the financial
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.400]   impact of owning a car.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.320]   There's no question that cars are a financial hassle.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   Cars are a financial hassle.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.160]   Depending on where you are in your wealth-building journey, you will want to consider the car
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.320]   and whether it will add to your life and your lifestyle and your finances and your enjoyment
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.640]   of life or not.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.440]   For many people who are at the beginning stage of their career, who are just starting their
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.640]   process of earning money, establishing themselves and their lifestyle and their career, cars
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.960]   will be the biggest expense both up front and also the biggest expense on an ongoing
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.880]   basis.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.640]   For the, say, 20-year-old young man or woman who's going out to buy his or her first car
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.080]   or 16-year-old or 24-year-old, whatever age you want to use, most likely that first car
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.280]   purchase will be the first big expense that that individual will make.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   I remember for me, my first car cost me $2,000 and it was the largest single expense that
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.800]   I had made at that point in time.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.200]   As your lifestyle grows, cars will usually be the biggest regular expense that you'll
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   face.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.400]   They're really dwarfed only by house purchases.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.520]   But it's not uncommon for someone to go and purchase a $50,000 car, $100,000 car and to
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.200]   do that every few years.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.720]   Unless you're running a business where you regularly have large business expenses or
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.400]   unless you're purchasing real estate, for most normal financial households, that will
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   be the biggest expense that you make on an ongoing basis.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.560]   So cars are expensive to buy.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   You have to put together the cash or put together the credit to make the up front payments necessary
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.800]   to acquire the vehicle.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.960]   Cars are also expensive to own.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.160]   Usually the biggest expense of a car is its depreciation.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.400]   Depreciation is a word that we use to describe how much something will decline in value due
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.640]   to its ongoing use.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.200]   And with cars, in normal markets, that number is pretty significant.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   Traditionally, I have to give these caveats because the last few years in the vehicle
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.240]   market have not been anything like what we understand to be normal due to the microchip
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.720]   shortage and the global supply line disruptions, etc.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.280]   But traditionally we say that cars normally lose about 20% of their value in the first
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.440]   year of ownership, assuming that you purchase one new.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.800]   And they also then lose about 15% of their value on an annual basis.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.680]   This has not been true over the last few years.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.200]   I've worked with many people who've gotten offers for their two or three year old car
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.920]   where people and businesses have offered to pay them more than they paid for the vehicle
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.740]   when it was brand new.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.220]   But I think this is a temporary condition that in most places will diminish and is already
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.100]   showing significant signs of diminishing.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.440]   So let's put this into context for a moment.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.000]   Let's assume that you go and today you purchase a fairly ordinary new car.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.800]   Could be a new middle of the road minivan, new pickup truck, new car.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.320]   This number would be applicable for most cars except kind of an entry level economy car.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.680]   Let's say you spend about $40,000.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.440]   Well, in the first year that you spend $40,000, you can expect that car to decline in value
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.200]   by about $8,000.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   That would be the first year depreciation.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.320]   It would decline in value from $40,000 to $32,000 and you would have $8,000 of depreciation.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   Why?
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.640]   Why does this exist?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:44.520]   Well, most people who are going to buy a $32,000 car could go out and buy a $40,000 car if
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.920]   they wanted one.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.680]   And so they're not willing to pay you as much for your car that they can go and get the
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.560]   same car from the dealer.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.880]   Why would somebody pay you $38,000 for your one year old car when they could go pay a
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.840]   dealer $40,000 for a brand new car and get all of the goods and guarantees that go with
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.880]   the new car?
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.600]   Everything from perfect warranty coverage, knowing the full service history of the vehicle,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   having the dealer protection plans and all of the special sales packages that you can
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   get with a dealer.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.840]   Everything to even the new car smell and the thrill of having a shiny new car that you
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   know no one has driven except you.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:29.340]   So a used car is in most people's lives much less valuable than a new car.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.160]   That's why we have depreciation.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.240]   The reason this has changed over the last couple of years is that there was a wide shortage
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.720]   of new cars and there was a wide shortage of new cars with the features and options
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.040]   that people wanted, especially due to the microchip shortage.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.520]   And so they wanted a car with certain features and the only way to get that car was to go
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.600]   and buy one that was a little bit older.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.640]   But again, this is not a permanent condition.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.080]   So in the first year of your $40,000 car purchase, you'll have $8,000 of depreciation.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:05.160]   I want you to imagine the kind of person who will often go out and purchase a $40,000 car.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.280]   Frequently that will be somebody who is just getting established in his lifestyle, somebody
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.720]   who's just building his savings.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   $8,000 of depreciation can be a pretty heavy cost for someone who doesn't have a lot of
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.580]   money to bear.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.200]   After all, there are many households where the people involved struggled to even fill
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.840]   up a Roth IRA.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.560]   Well $8,000 is more than an annual contribution to a Roth IRA.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:39.120]   And so if you recognize that some people are scrimping and saving to go and put $6,000
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.680]   in a Roth IRA, but you're having $6,000 in depreciation on your car, you're basically
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.840]   not actually making any forward financial progress.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.880]   For every payment into your Roth IRA, you then have the exact same amount fly out the
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.480]   door in terms of depreciation.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.400]   This immaterial expense that we can't really see but is actually there.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.120]   In the next year, it continues.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.560]   So now if we depreciate our $32,000 car by 15%, that would be a cost of depreciation
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.120]   in the second year of ownership of $4,800.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.760]   Almost $5,000.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   Once again, we might be scrimping and saving to put $5,000 in our Roth IRA and here goes
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.120]   $5,000 depreciation out the window.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.840]   So that car can be an expensive thing.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.040]   And the biggest expense is depreciation.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.880]   There are of course other expenses to be accounted for.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.720]   On your purchase expenses, you have taxes in addition to the purchase price, taxes,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.040]   registration fees.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.640]   On an annual basis, you have fees of insurance.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.280]   You have fees not only, you have costs not only of depreciation but also of direct mechanical
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:51.120]   repairs, insurance expenses, fuel to fund the thing, to make the thing go down the road,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.560]   and then just all of the other ancillary things, accessories, ways that you want to get your
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.680]   car just how you want it, accessories to make it more useful to you, to make it appropriate,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   et cetera.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.000]   So cars suck up quite a bit of money.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.800]   They also suck up quite a bit of time.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.680]   For me, I don't worry too much about the money that a car costs, but I often get annoyed
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.880]   with the time that a car entails.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   Time to go and get your registration done.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.500]   Time to go and take it to the mechanic when it needs to be fixed.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.480]   Time to have it washed and wash it yourself or time to have it washed and vacuumed, et
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480]   cetera.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.600]   I often find myself annoyed with the time required to maintain a vehicle.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.640]   Now certainly those are pretty ordinary things.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.400]   It's not that big a deal, but there are some downsides.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   In addition, owning a car can be a significant source of personal liability.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.480]   There can be first of all a sense of liability of worrying about the thing.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.720]   If you have a thing that is big and expensive, then if it represents an overly large amount
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.880]   of your budget or an overly large amount of your finances, the actual ownership can come
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.520]   with a significant psychological cost.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   Somebody who scrimps and saves and buys a car that's outside of his financial resources,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.040]   it gets very worried when a new scratch appears or gets very worried when there's a shopping
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   cart headed for it.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.160]   So that's one consideration.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.360]   It's also consideration even from the perspective of liability, personal liability.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.680]   It's interesting as somebody who practices a little bit of coaching and planning with
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.880]   regard to asset protection planning, I frequently speak to people about asset protection planning
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.760]   and the first thing I ask them is, "What is the source of liability that you face?"
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.960]   Many people dramatically overestimate the actual liabilities that exist in their life
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.760]   and in their financial world.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.240]   When we talk through it, if you're somebody who works at a job, goes to work every day,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.080]   comes home, isn't managing a company, doesn't have employees, doesn't have trucks driving
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.740]   all around town with your name on the side of them, generally the only liabilities you
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:08.160]   face are liabilities for either personal actions such as wronging someone, harassing someone,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   etc. or something related to your car or your home.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.160]   Those things can be controlled.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.200]   Your home of course has less liability where you can protect it quite a bit.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.840]   People talk about, "Oh, there's a slip and fall on my front sidewalk," but that's one
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.400]   thing to talk about.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.360]   It's another thing to actually have somebody bring a successful lawsuit against you, at
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.140]   least if your sidewalk is in proper working condition.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.880]   But your car on the other hand is frequently the biggest source of personal liability.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.080]   Your car because you can't often control the circumstances that you're in.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.020]   You can't control the roads, you can't control what people do or don't do, how other drivers
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.840]   drive or don't drive.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.340]   You can't control all of those aspects of it and frequently you might even commit a
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:01.000]   wrong in being negligent for a moment, sending a text message in your car while you're driving
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.480]   that distracts you.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.240]   So that automobile itself is often a source of significant personal liability.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   Now you can handle that with a quality liability policy as part of your car insurance and then
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.040]   you can link that with an umbrella liability policy in your home and you can handle the
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   liability pretty well.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.480]   There's a reason most people have cars.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.280]   But pointing out that cars do have downsides.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.560]   The longer you own a car, the more those downsides increase.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.180]   It seems that no matter what you do on the front end, the longer you own a car, the more
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.360]   you have to go and change out the tires, the more you have to take to the mechanic, the
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.880]   more you have to go and do inspections and registrations, etc. and the time and the money
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   continues forever.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.720]   We'll get to the positives in a moment.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.120]   But if these negatives are significant, you know I didn't even talk about other hassles
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.040]   because I don't live in the city and I don't think much about this.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.080]   First of all, if you live in the city also, think about things like parking expense or
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   think about things like the hassle of even keeping the car safely parked and keeping
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.120]   the car moved so that you don't get excessive tickets.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   Where are you going to park the thing?
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.600]   It takes up a lot of space.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.360]   That's to say nothing of even the lifestyle impact of designing cities around cars.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.600]   I'm a fan of the designs of cities that don't involve cars because I think they make for
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.480]   more pleasant housing for people, more pleasant towns.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   And when we design most of our modern cities around car ownership, they make very unpleasant
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.720]   cities.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.860]   And so there are environmental impacts that people can consider.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.920]   There are many other reasons that you can fill in.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.840]   So could you avoid owning a car in the first place?
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.360]   I think undoubtedly many people can.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   And in the future, more and more people will be able to avoid owning a car.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.800]   Let's begin with the old-fashioned ways of handling this problem.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:56.080]   First, people who have little need to commute can generally avoid owning a car.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.900]   If you work from home, either in the modern sense of being a knowledge worker who works
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.720]   from your home office, in a traditional sense of being a homemaker, your need for a vehicle
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.200]   on a daily basis is pretty diminished.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.440]   If you are at home and if you're living in a home where you like to be, and if you're
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.800]   living in a home where you can access the things around you that are nice for you and
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.840]   for your family, then there's little reason for you to need a car on a regular basis other
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.000]   than an occasional Costco run, etc.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.040]   And so if you can build a lifestyle for yourself that doesn't revolve around car ownership,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.360]   that can be a major improvement.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.640]   Years ago, my wife and I, after we've been married a little bit, we bought a house.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.320]   And one of the things that I prioritized in the purchase of that house was to purchase
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   a house that was less dependent on needing a car.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.120]   We didn't go car-free, but we went car-light at the time, dropping from two cars to one
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   car.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   And it was not only a savings of finances, it was not only a savings of hassle, but it
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.960]   was genuinely a significant lifestyle improvement.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.480]   I purchased a house that was about a third of a mile from my office.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.360]   I did work in an office and I needed to go to an office, but I would simply walk or ride
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.880]   a bicycle to my office.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.240]   That was wonderful.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.100]   When you think about the lifestyle benefits of not having to rely on a vehicle, not having
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.440]   to sit in traffic, not having to sit on the road, not having to deal with the time suck
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:31.160]   of commuting, it's a major, major benefit to be within walking or bicycling distance
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.660]   to your office.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.000]   But more importantly, we bought a house that had good access to a lot of the things that
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.880]   our family benefited from.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.320]   We were similarly about a quarter of a mile from a grocery store.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.440]   A good, excellent grocery store where we could go, we would take our bikes and our bike trailer
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.860]   and do our grocery shopping and bring our groceries home in our bicycle trailer.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.640]   We were slightly more, a quarter, half a mile from a library.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.200]   So we would do regular library outings and that was the primary focus of outings with
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.440]   the children, go for library story time, go and get books, et cetera.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.800]   We were close to several parks, several municipal parks, so we could easily walk and ride bicycles
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.120]   to those parks.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.960]   So most of the things that we needed on a daily or weekly basis were within striking
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.120]   distance of our home, easily achievable with a pleasant walk and/or a pleasant bicycle
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.600]   ride.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.960]   That was not, again, that was a lifestyle improvement.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.480]   And so if you have little need to commute because you can arrange that kind of lifestyle
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.240]   with telework, that's kind of an old-fashioned term, with just modern working from home,
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.040]   that's a phenomenal improvement in lifestyle to not have to deal with the hassle of a car.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.980]   Now of course, another way to accomplish this is by living somewhere where there's a strong
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.520]   public transportation system.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.480]   And if you live in a place where public transportation is convenient, where it's reasonably priced,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.880]   where it's useful to you, then obviously this becomes much more achievable.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.840]   Many of the biggest cities in the world have great public transport systems, and having
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.080]   a car is just—or sorry, not having a car is considered the normal affair.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.760]   If you live in the suburbs or you live in an American city that's sprawled out all over
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.160]   the place, then the public transportation system is probably so inconvenient that once
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   you scrape together a few shekels, you're ready to go ahead and get a car for the convenience
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   factor.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.680]   But you can make an intentional decision to live in a place where there is a strong public
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.500]   transportation system.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.840]   And you can even do this by thinking about, for example, living on a hub, somewhere where
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.580]   you're conveniently located to the transportation system.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.220]   You might be a little bit out of the city, but you live near a train terminal or near
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.720]   a bus stop or near some form of transportation system that makes it convenient enough for
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.980]   you to go, get on the train, put that time to productive use so you don't have to spend
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.700]   it sitting in your car yourself.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.980]   Living on a hub or a spur like that makes life better.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.740]   One of the—then of course the classic solution has been to simply take taxis or arrange for
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.620]   private driver services.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.900]   There's been a dramatic improvement over the last decade in the convenience of these services,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:13.420]   where now that you can order a car with any number of excellent apps on your phone, and
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.060]   you can pre-schedule the car to be there at a certain time and to take you where you want
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:23.020]   to go, you can have those fees easily billed to your card.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   Everything just works.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:30.220]   It's so convenient to order your transportation in that way that it makes a lot of sense for
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.740]   people to do that instead of owning or using a car on a regular basis.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.420]   A couple of stories to drive this point home.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:44.200]   Number one, for people who are elderly or for people who are poor, I think that this
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.800]   is a really, really good solution.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.820]   Let's begin with the elderly.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.660]   As a standard part of Joshua's speech to elderly people or people who are approaching
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.700]   elderliness, I routinely encourage them to be technically competent and experienced enough
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.940]   where they can learn how to use transportation apps.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.780]   Because one of the classic problems of growing older has been the loss of independence.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.380]   That traditionally as you've gotten older and it became unsafe for you to drive or you
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.300]   didn't want to drive anymore, then you became completely dependent on your friends, your
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.140]   loved ones, your family for taking you around.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.380]   But with the modern ride sharing applications that are available, it no longer has to be
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.380]   that way.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.300]   And so one of the things that I try to do is encourage older people to become comfortable
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.660]   and accustomed to using those services.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.300]   Because it makes it so that instead of sitting around and waiting for your daughter or your
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.500]   son or somebody who's busy to come and take you once a week or once every two weeks on
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:50.100]   grocery outings, you can reliably and independently get yourself transported to where you want
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.820]   to go for your other two or three outings a week that will help you to really enjoy
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.720]   your life and your lifestyle.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.380]   So I encourage you, if you're interacting with elderly people who may not be able to
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:06.100]   maintain a car, then go ahead and talk to them about that and see if you can help them
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.020]   to learn how to be comfortable using ride sharing apps so that they can be independent.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:17.300]   In addition, for people who are poor, owning a car can be a significant expense, even if
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.700]   the car is paid off.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.980]   There was a friend of mine that I worked with for a number of years trying to help, and
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.620]   he was living on a very modest social security income.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.500]   And yet he was addicted to owning his car.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.940]   He had a very modest rent.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.060]   He lived in a location that was quite convenient and where he could have easily walked to most
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.140]   of the things that he needed to do, such as grocery shopping, etc.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.940]   But his entire life he had owned a car.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.260]   His financial situation no longer permitted him to keep his car in as good a situation
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.260]   as he wanted to keep it.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   And when I sat down and did the numbers, the amount of money that he was spending on his
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.620]   car was literally hundreds of dollars per month of maintenance for an old car.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.340]   And he didn't have the capital necessary to purchase a new car.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:06.660]   And I urged him to sell the car, get rid of the car, and simply use a ride-sharing app.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.560]   Because he had enough resources of friends that he could borrow a car from on occasion.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.340]   If a ride-sharing app was unavailable, enough friends and people to rely on, that it would
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.300]   have been a good situation for him.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.220]   In his situation, he couldn't conceive of it because culturally it didn't fit.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.780]   His entire life he had a car.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.160]   He couldn't conceive of not having a car.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.860]   But even though he wasn't in a downtown environment, the financial benefit of just paying for the
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.460]   ride that you need, instead of paying for this ongoing maintenance and expenses of maintaining
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:42.860]   a car that was increasingly unreliable and showed no signs of reducing its monthly outflows
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.980]   (or I guess the car's monthly inflows, how much was necessary to support it), it would
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.820]   have been a lot better financially.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.900]   It was just this block in his mind about the lifestyle perspective and the freedom perspective.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:01.100]   Then finally, we get to the concept of at a higher end, just simply using ride-sharing
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.460]   services instead of a private car service.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.220]   Years ago when I was a financial planner, I would go see a lot of people in their offices.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.500]   I drove a lot.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.620]   I sat down and I realized I was driving so much and I thought this time really could
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.060]   be better put to better use.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.380]   At the time, I seriously considered hiring a driver to drive me around.
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:28.620]   It was something that wealthier, more productive financial advisors, a few of them did, and
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.660]   they used their car time much more productively if they had a driver.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:38.660]   At the time, it didn't make sense.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.980]   Today though, number one, I solved a lot of that by simply stopping going to seeing people
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.380]   and sitting in my office having people come to me instead.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.260]   And then of course this was prior to the widespread acceptance of Zoom meetings, etc.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.380]   Today with Zoom, you could get by even better.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:25:00.920]   But then today, by simply using a ride-sharing service regularly, you can get very close
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.560]   to what was formerly kind of a rich man's lifestyle choice to have a full-time driver.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.440]   You can get there pretty well, pretty close to that at a fraction of the cost simply using
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   ride-sharing services.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:20.680]   I have a friend of mine who had his driver's license suspended, and yet this guy had a
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.000]   job where he needed to go all over town for meetings, and so he had no option but to use
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   ride-sharing services.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.520]   And when we sat down and looked at the amount he was spending, his ride-sharing services,
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   even for regular meetings all around town, come out to about $1,000 a month.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.880]   And $1,000 a month for having a driver take you where you want to go whenever you want
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.320]   to, while there is in some cases a decrease in convenience, that's a pretty reasonable
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.880]   cost to have what formerly you could really only have with a full-time chauffeur and all
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.240]   of the car expenses associated with it.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.720]   So if you're somebody who spends a couple thousand dollars a month on vehicle expenses,
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.520]   and if you would like to have that time to yourself where you just get into the car and
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.760]   go, seriously consider that.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.520]   It's not perfect in all situations.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.320]   The biggest problem is if you're doing business in a place where you can't get rides quickly
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.160]   and conveniently, but if you're in a place where the ride-sharing services come quickly,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.960]   you can schedule them when you want to, and you have enough flexibility that that could
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.480]   work for you, that can be a better solution.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.440]   And it can allow you to avoid owning a car.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.800]   And then we get to the alternatives that involve you transporting yourself instead of being
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.000]   transported by a vehicle.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.960]   You can establish a lifestyle for yourself where you have an alternative to either walk
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.240]   or bicycle to the places that you want to go.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.720]   And if you'll think carefully about the choices that you make, you can do this in comfort
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.280]   with excellence, and it doesn't have to be a sense of deprivation.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.800]   First, consider carefully where you live.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.180]   There are cities that are very unpleasant to be in without a car, and there are cities
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.320]   that are very pleasant to be in without a car.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:10.360]   And you can choose intentionally to live in one of the cities that is pleasant to be in.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.340]   Remember that cities, states, and countries are all competing for your presence and for
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.160]   your business.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.660]   In order for a city or a state or a country to be effective and successful, it needs population.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.840]   And you can choose to simply pull up roots where you are and go to a place that has the
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.560]   kinds of amenities that you desire.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.000]   And these lifestyle amenities can be a big factor of it.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.080]   Just last week I was talking with a Dutch friend about Amsterdam.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.320]   The Amsterdam bicycle culture is truly incredible.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.420]   If you're not familiar with it, just go on YouTube and grab a few things and let the
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.000]   algorithm send you all kinds of videos extolling the virtues of the bicycle culture in the
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.120]   Netherlands.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.080]   But it truly is remarkable that you can choose to live in a city where you can get along
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   quite well and very comfortably with a bicycle rather than a car.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.320]   And you can do that in many places all around the world, in many places in your state, your
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.520]   country, where you already are.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.340]   You can do it in even many neighborhoods.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.560]   So choose to think about where you locate yourself.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.800]   In addition, most cities actually have interesting ways that if you'll sit down and look at a
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.160]   map or figure out what's there in the city, you can figure out something that would allow
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:34.000]   you to attend to most of what you need to attend to with a bicycle or with walking.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   I think of course here bicycling is the normal way because walking, maybe you have a distance
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.000]   of say five miles.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.080]   Five miles is traditionally considered walking distance throughout most of the history of
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   humanity.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.960]   In the modern world, most of us would not consider that to be walking distance, but
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.620]   you certainly can walk comfortably a couple of miles.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.400]   But bicycling really is comfortable.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.840]   And what I would encourage you is not only consider if there is a suitable bike route
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.960]   for you to get from your home to your office or to the kinds of events that you care about,
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.400]   but think about if there's something that would be accessible to you with an e-bike.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.360]   One of the technologies that I'm so excited about in the modern world is battery powered
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.240]   electric bicycles.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.920]   If you haven't ever ridden an electric bicycle, I would urge you to find what place where
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.640]   you can rent one, ride a friend, et cetera, and try it out.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.940]   Because an electric bicycle, as far as I'm concerned, solves all of those kind of lingering
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.640]   reasons why people don't bicycle.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.960]   There are times when riding a bicycle where you're tired, you don't want to pedal, or
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.040]   you have to go up hills, or it's hot outside, et cetera.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:48.600]   But if you get a high powered, good quality electric bicycle, it basically gives you the
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:57.000]   equivalent of a small motorcycle with all of the convenience of a bicycle.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.960]   Motorcycles are certainly one reasonable transportation option in places where you can ride them safely.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.260]   But because of their noise, because of their size, and because of their clear classification
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.600]   as a motor vehicle, you have all of the limitations and restrictions of a motor vehicle.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.360]   But a bicycle has few of those restrictions.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:20.480]   Motorcycles can generally, in some places, ignore some of the transportation laws.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.280]   You don't feel bad about going up on the sidewalk where appropriate.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.960]   You don't feel bad cutting across a parking lot to shave a corner, et cetera.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.720]   If you pair the bicycle with a good electric motor, it really gives you the best of both
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.800]   worlds, where you have the ease and the joy of a motorcycle with a bicycle, with the convenience,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.240]   lightness, ease, and just joy of a bicycle.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.400]   There are many people, I think that certainly there are people who could easily handle a
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.320]   10 mile commute on a regular bicycle.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:57.040]   But there are many more people who, if they tried out an electric bicycle, could embrace
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.200]   easily a 10 mile commute on an electric bicycle without worrying about being fatigued, without
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.160]   worrying about being excessively sweaty, et cetera.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.120]   So if you chose a house, let's say you needed to work in a downtown area, but you chose
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   a house that was along a green corridor, or a place where you had great bike paths, or
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.920]   just a really beautiful place to ride your bicycle on a daily commute, that could allow
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.040]   you to diminish your need for a car.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.920]   So these are some of the reasons to avoid buying a car, and here are some of the alternatives.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:34.000]   And I believe that with appropriate texture for individual situations, these alternatives
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.840]   offer enough positive features that make them a genuinely better lifestyle.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:47.200]   If you live in a town where you could bicycle to the things that matter to you, to your
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.060]   work, to your grocery store, to your social engagements, to all the places that you want
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:59.080]   to do, and you could dispense with the car without suffering a lifestyle subtraction,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.280]   that can be a major improvement in lifestyle.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.040]   And it's not just financial.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   The finances can be simply the icing on the cake.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:14.120]   By the way, let me point out, I think here, from a financial perspective, if a move is
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.800]   required, for example, let's say you're living in a house in the middle of nowhere, but you
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.680]   could move to another house that was closer to town.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.080]   If a move is required, and if the move requires you to spend more money on real estate to
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.520]   accomplish it, as your financial planner, I would urge you to consider it.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.400]   Because from a financial perspective, you need to remember that cars go down in value,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.680]   and commuting expenses are not deductible.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.280]   Cars go down in value very quickly, and commuting expenses are not deductible.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:52.700]   On the other hand, houses generally go up in value, and the expenses associated with
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:58.840]   housing are very highly deductible.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.640]   Looking at that, if you had the choice, and you said, "I've got to move from a $500,000
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.600]   house in the suburbs to a $1,000,000 house in that great neighborhood in town, but it's
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:15.360]   going to cause me to come out of pocket another half a million dollars," while that's a significant
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.560]   amount that I'm not sure you're going to get rid of with saving on car expenses, it's probably
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.680]   the best financial move.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:29.840]   As your resources grow, one of the best investments you can make is to purchase increasingly expensive
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.160]   personal residences, because those generally go up in value.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.000]   As you move from the suburbs to the better neighborhoods in town, your houses become
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.060]   more and more and more attractive.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:47.760]   If it's necessary for you to justify that increase in real estate cost by getting rid
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.960]   of a car, and going from a two-car family to a one-car family, or going to a zero-car
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.400]   family, financially, that's a better move.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.680]   If you can get rid of all those non-deductible commuting expenses and convert them into deductible
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.220]   expenses for real estate taxes and mortgage interest, et cetera, that will generally be
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.680]   a better move.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.280]   Better for you to own a $1,000,000 house in the middle of the city in a highly desirable,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.040]   walkable, bike-sickable neighborhood, and be without a car, and without the financial
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.760]   albatross that that thing can be hanging around your neck, than for you to be in your $500,000
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.800]   house out on the periphery, spending $20,000 to $30,000 a year maintaining your car.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.600]   Better to put the $20,000 to $30,000 a year into mortgage payments that are reducing your
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.920]   principal and allowing you to own a more expensive, more attractive house, and live a better lifestyle,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.840]   saving time, et cetera.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.320]   That's my argument against owning a car.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.760]   Now let's assume that you've considered that, and you're like, "Well, I think I do want
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.160]   to own a car, and I think I need to own a car, or I want to own a car."
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.320]   So what are the reasons why you would need or want to own a car?
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.960]   By the way, I don't think you need to justify it as need or want.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.520]   So I'm going to use these terms synonymously.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   At the end of the day, remember, it's always your money.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.280]   You spend it on whatever you want.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.600]   And if you go into a spending decision with your eyes wide open, and you choose what you
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.440]   value personally, and you spend your money on that, go for it.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.920]   But the first obvious reason to own a car is that, especially from a financial planning
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.040]   perspective, is if that car allows you to earn money.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   If a car allows you to earn money, then you can easily justify its expense.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:35.280]   If you live 25 miles away from your job, and you couldn't go and have the job without being
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:41.480]   able to get there back and forth every day, then your obvious thing you need is a car
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   to get you to the job.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.840]   And this is one thing that if you study the very poor, one of the best lifestyle and financial
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.320]   investments that those who are very poor can make, especially if they're living in communities
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.660]   with poor public transportation, is to get a car.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.960]   Because then that allows them to reliably get to work, to get jobs they ordinarily wouldn't
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.120]   be able to get because they were depending on public transportation, and to be better,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.720]   more consistent workers.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.880]   And so the same thing can apply whether you're 18 or whether you're 58.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.760]   If the car allows you to get to work, then it can be a wonderful solution.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.640]   Say all you want about complaining about sitting in traffic, but it's one thing to be making
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:25.000]   $300,000 a year and then be annoyed with sitting in traffic for an hour each way.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.360]   That's very different than making $30,000 a year and looking around trying to figure
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.120]   out how to improve your situation in life and realizing that there's no possibility
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.580]   for me to make more living where I'm living, working in this area where I'm working.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.840]   The car can allow you to access a different market.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.220]   The car can allow you to access a different job.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:48.000]   And so a car can in many ways be a really important tool that allows you to go and earn
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.560]   a great living.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.880]   Related to that, the car can be, even if it's not strictly a transportation necessity, the
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.680]   car can be part of your overall presentation, part of your professional image, and thus
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   an important thing for you to spend money on, even if you don't technically need it.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.220]   When I was younger, I underestimated the importance of this.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.040]   When I was a financial advisor and I was riding my bicycle to work, I was feeling quite smug
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.800]   and self-satisfied about myself because I was making smart decisions of riding my bicycle.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   Today I look back and I realize a little bit more detachment that it was a foolish thing
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.200]   for me to do because while me being the weirdo who rides a bicycle to work works very well
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   in the world of a podcast where I can call a podcast radical personal finance, in the
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:40.880]   normal everyday kind of systems of life, it marked me as being excessively weird and excessively
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.980]   strange.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:46.040]   And people don't generally like hanging out with people or even doing business with people
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.740]   who are excessively weird and excessively strange.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.040]   So if you work in a place where it's totally normal for people to ride bicycles, great,
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   go for it.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.080]   But if you work in an office where it's totally normal for everyone to drive BMWs, then almost
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.240]   certainly you should be getting a BMW because it's part of your overall image, it's part
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.440]   of your overall presentation.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:10.880]   And you will make your co-workers much more comfortable with you if you fit in to their
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:18.920]   preconceived ideas, to their stereotypes, and to their biases.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.900]   You'll get farther in the world if you recognize that the person that you're signaling yourself
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:29.200]   to be needs to be somebody who fits in.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.520]   And to use another example, we'll talk about this quite a lot in the episode coming up
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.680]   where we talk about what kind of car to get.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.280]   So I'm going to just short circuit it here, but you need to be very conscious of signaling
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   theory.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.320]   You need to be very conscious of the kind of person that you're signaling yourself to
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   be.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.240]   Again, I can talk freely here on a podcast called radical personal finance about being
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.160]   the weirdo who would ride his bicycle to work.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.680]   And that's fine in this context because it's part of a congruent image of my signaling
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.520]   myself to be a radical free thinker to a certain measure.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.920]   And while there are many listeners who will listen and say, "I would never do that," they
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.680]   kind of chuckle and say, "Well, that's just Joshua.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.960]   He does that."
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:18.000]   But if I'm working in an attorney office or a financial planning office, it's just a totally
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.160]   different world.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:24.040]   And so in hindsight, I see that I was too immature and I didn't perceive that I was
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.120]   causing people to feel uncomfortable with my eccentricity.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.600]   And it would have been better if I had simply gone out, purchased a BMW, fit into the mold
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.320]   that everyone expected of me, and simply signaled that I belonged.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:45.880]   Now, that's less damaging in a profession like financial planning where you basically
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.720]   bring in your own business and all that matters is the business.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:56.200]   But if you are dependent on coworkers for their approval, that you're an attorney and
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.320]   you want to be on a track to make partner or you're working in a professional office,
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.080]   then it's very important that while certainly you can have your eccentricities, they need
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   to be fairly muted if you desire for your career advancement to flow along smoothly.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.200]   And so this has to do with how you dress, the car that you drive, the way that you speak,
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   et cetera.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.800]   You want to make it as easy as possible for people to accept you as part of the group.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.120]   And unless there is a personal career advantage to your being a free thinker of some kind,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.680]   then make it easy for people to accept you.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.520]   Don't make it hard for them to accept you.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.040]   And so this applies to, again, to all those factors.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.360]   It applies to your car, it applies to the way your hair cut, it applies to everything.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.040]   You want to make it easy for people to accept you so that they don't feel like it's a big
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   risk to promote you, to pass you on, et cetera.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.320]   There's an old cliche that no one ever got fired for choosing IBM.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:03.520]   But that cliche portrays a truth, meaning in people's careers, they're generally looking
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.160]   to reduce risk.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:13.840]   So when you're choosing someone to promote, you want to choose the person who is the least
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   risky.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.360]   When you're choosing someone to support politically, you're generally choosing someone that's the
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.160]   least risky for your perspective.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   And in companies and things like that, if you just say, "Oh, I'm the guy who comes in
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:33.020]   and rides a bicycle," then it paints you as an iconoclast, somebody who might be kind
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.880]   of a risky guy to promote.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.580]   And so that's something that you should be very, very careful and thoughtful about doing.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:46.000]   So reason number one to get a car is clearly if you need a car to earn money.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.440]   Reason number two to get a car is if you want a car or need a car to enhance your lifestyle.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:59.160]   Cars can be powerful, powerful lifestyle tools in so many ways.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.280]   So I mentioned at the beginning of the show, why don't I live car-free?
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.840]   It's because I have four children.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:12.200]   And with children, my lifestyle is so much better having a car than not having a car.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.440]   Maybe if I lived in downtown Amsterdam, we'd all do bicycles, right?
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.360]   I'd have a back-feet bicycle and I'd trundle all my children around, maybe.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.720]   But I don't live in downtown Amsterdam and I don't want to do that.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.860]   So having the ability to come and go as I like, to take trips, to stop when I want to,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.920]   to be able to load up my children and go and get groceries and things like that, a car
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.720]   is a really, really important and valuable lifestyle tool.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.080]   If I were single, I would avoid, generally, with one more caveat coming, I would avoid
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.480]   having a car.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.400]   But in the modern world, with having children, having a car is a great lifestyle tool.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.920]   A car can also enhance your lifestyle in many, many other ways.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.320]   So you can say all you want about saying, "I'm going to live in downtown New York City
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.760]   and I'm just going to rent a car when I want to go out of the city," or, "I'm going to
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.600]   live in a downtown city wherever."
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   And that is true.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.080]   You can rent a car whenever you want to go out of the city.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:10.040]   In my experience, having tried that, you wind up renting the car less frequently because
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.000]   of even the hassle of renting it.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And you wind up saying no to some of the trips that you would take if it were your own car.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.340]   So having a car might mean that you travel more frequently, that you go up to the ski
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.600]   slope more frequently, et cetera.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.240]   Yeah, you can rent a car, but often even the times that you want to rent a car are the
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.960]   times that everyone else wants to rent a car.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.440]   The selection is lower, the prices are higher, et cetera.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.200]   And so just having your own wheels and transportation is really, really valuable.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.600]   In addition, there are many lifestyle things that you can enjoy with a car that you wouldn't
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.380]   otherwise enjoy.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.620]   So whether it's going to the grocery store, which I have done, especially in global travels
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.620]   with my family.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.020]   I've gone many times, taken all my children, we've ridden the bus from our rental house
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.480]   to the grocery store, and then get all the groceries and come back.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.680]   And usually it turns a grocery store trip into something that's exhausting.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.440]   Even in places with good public transportation, it's just tiring and annoying compared to
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   doing it yourself.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.320]   But then there are many hobbies and things that you could otherwise do with a car, whether
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.420]   it's taking your pickup truck with a camper in the back out to the lake, going out and
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.820]   overlanding in the woods, going out to your favorite surf spot, just driving out on a
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.840]   whim out of the city and going and looking at the stars, doing whatever the things are
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.240]   that you like to do.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.880]   Having the ability, again, take your children to the things that they want to do.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.520]   Having a car can be a tremendous lifestyle enhancement.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.080]   It increases your fun.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.500]   It increases the things that you can do and allows you to do those things and access those
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.560]   things regularly.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.620]   Then of course there are longer term scenarios, right?
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.760]   The freedom to come and go as you like.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:50.320]   I was particularly aware of this during the COVID pandemic when being on public transportation
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.560]   became very, very unpleasant.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.120]   Many places the public transportation was cut due to the decrease in demand and so you
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.320]   had fewer routes.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:05.100]   Then they reduced capacity and then they imposed all kinds of onerous rules about how close
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.600]   you could sit to people, what you had to wear over your face, et cetera, to get on public
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.080]   transportation.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.320]   Having a car can eliminate all those things.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.440]   For me, having a car is even just a symbol of personal freedom.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.760]   The classic idea of I can go where I want to go, when I want to go, I can do what I
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.000]   want to do is really, really important for personal freedom.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.520]   Or part of my emergency measures, right?
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.360]   I talk about emergency planning.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.260]   If I ever need to get out of the town where I live for whatever reason, I want to make
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.040]   sure that I have a car, that I'm not trying to go and rent a car last minute to get out
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.160]   of the city, but I have a car.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.880]   I can load up my family and I can leave from a place that's unsafe for them and go to a
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.680]   place that is better and is safer.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.720]   There are many good reasons to have a car.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.480]   Secondly, the secret is simply if you can afford a car and you think it enhances your
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.720]   lifestyle, get one, get several, get whatever you want.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   Just make sure that you can easily and comfortably afford the car.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.600]   So most of this discourse is directed at those who are just getting started.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.880]   Whether you're just getting started because you are young, whether you're just getting
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.480]   started because you suffered a setback and you're kind of starting all over again.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.760]   Well, if you're just getting started, then the car is a big decision.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.560]   One of your goals should be to quickly get your finances to the point where the car is
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.240]   not really a decision, where it just really doesn't matter.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:34.220]   That as far as I'm concerned is one of the great secrets in life, is make your expenses
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.560]   at a level where they don't really matter to you.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:44.200]   So if you'll do that, your life can be very low stress and a lot of it comes down to some
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.320]   of these basic decisions of thinking about what's going to happen.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.040]   I'll give you just a simple example.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.760]   I remember when I've tried to imagine, maybe someday I'll give you my 10 of them, but I'll
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:03.440]   just give you a couple now of the milestones that matter to me in my wealth building stage.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.640]   When I was younger, I thought certain numbers mattered.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.960]   Okay, if I can only have $100,000, if I can only have a million dollars, if I can only
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.140]   have this number, then that would matter.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.800]   Those numbers aren't really meaningful.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.900]   The human brain doesn't grasp these intangible things called numbers.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.760]   So what I've found is I've tried to put those numbers or goals into things that are more
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.140]   tangible.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:30.080]   So there was a point in my life in which I would never order a glass of wine with dinner
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.040]   because I wanted to save the money.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.600]   And then I reached a point in time in which I said, "I'm always going to order the glass
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   of wine.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.680]   If I want to have a glass of wine, I'm not going to worry about this expense."
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.160]   That was a tangible one.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.600]   Another tangible one was when I reached the point where I didn't care about the price
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.480]   of gas.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.260]   And there was a time in my life in which the price of gas was the single biggest impact
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.260]   for me.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.760]   I remember I would go to the gas station, I put $8 in, $13 in, and I would sweat about
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.120]   the price of gas because I had no money.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.080]   Then I reached the point in my life where the price of gas didn't matter.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.200]   And part of it didn't matter because I built a lifestyle that didn't depend a lot on gas,
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.680]   and then part of it just didn't matter because it's just not a big factor in my overall budget.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.600]   And I remember, "Wow, that was great."
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.540]   Similar stage of getting to the point where the price of a car is no big deal.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:22.080]   For one guy, he'll go out and sweat and sweat and sweat when thinking about buying a $30,000
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.800]   car and do all his research.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.240]   Another guy would just go buy a car.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.960]   Another guy would go buy a $130,000 car and it's no big deal.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:34.520]   So that's a big kind of benchmark.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.440]   I haven't gotten to the point where buying a $130,000 car is no big deal, but I'm working
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   hard.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.800]   And that's the goal, to get to the point where even just the purchase of a car or the ownership
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.000]   of a car, all this stuff, no big deal.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.280]   And then you reach another stage where it's even with houses, where, "Get another house,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.480]   no big deal."
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:59.120]   But along the way, you can't really short-circuit the process.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.720]   If you don't pay attention to the glass of wine or you don't pay attention to the cost
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.920]   of the car at a certain phase of your life, there's a very good chance that you won't
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.800]   be able to get to the point where you don't need to worry about the cost of the car or
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.480]   the cost of the house.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.080]   You can't short-circuit the wealth-building process.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.760]   Sometimes you can turbocharge your income so quickly that you can go there, but you
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.440]   can make it fast, but you can't short-circuit the wealth-building process.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.560]   You have to get enough money growing for you in order for you to genuinely have compound
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.360]   interest and other people working for you and your investments working for you for your
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.040]   wealth-building to grow.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.960]   So recognize that this matters, this subject of how to buy a car, this really does matter,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.160]   but it matters at a certain time in your life.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.440]   You want to focus on figuring out where you are in the process of wealth-building.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.180]   And if you're at the beginning stage of wealth-building, again, either because you're young, because
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:58.000]   you've suffered a setback, et cetera, then the car decision is a very important thing
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.560]   to get right, very important.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:07.920]   Then later, at a later stage, the car will cease to be a factor at all in your budget.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.520]   So identify where you are.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:15.440]   If you're in the getting started stage, then think seriously, can I avoid the car?
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   Think seriously, can I avoid it completely?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.800]   And then if I have to get a car, we'll talk about how much to spend on a car, et cetera,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:28.320]   but if I have to get a car, how can I minimize the expense and minimize the hassle of this
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.560]   so that I can maximize my lifestyle?
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.400]   The strange thing about it is this.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:39.760]   When you're very, very broke or very, very poor, then probably the best solution is not
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.480]   to have a car.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.720]   Then you reach this middle stage of wealth where undoubtedly the car is probably the
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.020]   best solution.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.280]   Then you reach a point in wealth in which probably the best solution is not to have
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.440]   a car again.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.720]   I again, I get so annoyed by the time and the hassle associated with buying cars.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.280]   It's not the money, it's the hassle.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.120]   And so you reach a time where I love renting cars.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.120]   I love it.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   You fly in.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:11.240]   I have the gold status with a bunch of the rental car agencies.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:19.400]   And so if you have a good gold status or platinum status with a rental car agency, you fly in,
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.680]   in the airport, you walk over to the rental car place.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   Usually it's in the airport or whatever.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.360]   You're right there.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   You walk up to your car.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   The keys are in it.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.200]   They tell you what space it is.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.840]   You get in, you start the car, you drive out.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.960]   You drive out, you know the car is in good working condition.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.320]   You know it's clean, it's fresh, it's ready to go.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.000]   You drive out, you use it, right?
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.120]   Go use it for a week, a month, whatever you want to do.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.800]   Then when you're done with the car, you drive back to the airport, you pull in the spot,
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.080]   you leave the keys in it and you go get on your airplane.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.480]   Everything gets billed to your credit card.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.840]   It's the best thing in the world.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.880]   It is so, so nice now.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:59.800]   Again, the car rental experience, especially in the United States, it happens internationally,
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.680]   but especially in the United States, the car rental experience, if you have a premier level
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.840]   of membership in one of the agencies, is just wonderful.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.240]   That's the best way to use a car, in my opinion.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.000]   You get all of the good, someone else takes care of all the bad.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.480]   That's not the most cost efficient way to handle a vehicle on the ongoing basis, but
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.920]   that's the best way to have a car.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.080]   It's just not own it at all.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.320]   You go through this curve when you're beginning and broke.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.640]   The car expenses are a big deal.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.920]   You want to minimize those and you especially want to minimize those by eliminating them
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.040]   if you can.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.920]   Then you get to the point where the car ownership is no big deal.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.440]   Even though you could drive to work, or sorry, ride your bicycle to work, you do that most
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.840]   days, but you keep an extra car just for the rainy days.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.880]   Or you have a car just because you want a car and it allows you to go to the mountains
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.040]   on the weekend.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.160]   Then you reach a point in time where you're really rich and yeah, you'll probably still
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.600]   keep some cars around, but it becomes a hassle to keep a car in every house and who's going
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.320]   to take it and who's going to keep the stuff done and you wind up just renting the car
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:05.600]   because it's a simpler, easier thing for you to do.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.680]   Consider carefully your decision to buy a car because the decision to buy a car will
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.720]   make a big difference for you on a long-term basis.
