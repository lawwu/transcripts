[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820]   I want to call your attention this afternoon to that piece of history in the long and jacket
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.020]   story of the children of Israel, the Jews, that was recorded in the chapter read to us
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.980]   at the beginning, namely the fourth chapter of the first book of Samuel. And I want in
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.300]   particular to call attention to the last paragraph, beginning at the 19th verse and going to the
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.740]   end of the chapter. "And his daughter-in-law, Phineas, his wife, which was with child, near
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.380]   to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.620]   father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and traveled, for her pains
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.900]   came upon her. And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said unto her,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.620]   'Fear not, for thou hast born a son.' But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.220]   And she named the child Ichabod, saying, 'The glory is departed from Israel, because the
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.940]   ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.' And she said, 'The glory
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:26.980]   is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.'" Now I want to consider that story,
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.940]   that incident with you, especially taken together with another bit of history, which is found
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.020]   in the last chapter of the book of Exodus, namely the 40th chapter of the book of Exodus,
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.100]   reading verses 34 and 35. "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.180]   of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.500]   congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.260]   Now I take these two statements, because, as you can see at a glance, they present us
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.380]   with a very striking contrast. In that last statement at the end of the book of Exodus,
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.060]   we have an account of the erection of the tabernacle in which the children of Israel
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.140]   were to worship. God had commended it, as I'm going to show you later, and had given
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.020]   full instructions with regard to the erection of this building. And then we are told of
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:48.300]   how the glory of God came down upon and into that building, that tabernacle. But in this
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.340]   other bit of history, in the first book of Samuel, chapter 4, we have a very sad account
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.900]   of the departure of the glory of the Lord. In the first, the coming of the glory; in
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.940]   the second, the departure of the glory. Now I call your attention to these two incidents
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.020]   together, because I think that they have a very salutary lesson for all of us, and a
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.900]   very needed lesson for all of us, meeting together this afternoon on a happy occasion
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.980]   such as this. We must make use of this occasion to remind ourselves again of what a church
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.940]   really is, what a church is for, and how a church is truly to function. And we're meeting
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.860]   in days which, I need scarcely remind you, are very sad days for the Christian church.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.140]   There are days which, I'm afraid, far too accurately are described in that fourth chapter
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.740]   of the first book of Samuel. I'm not saying that the glory has departed altogether, but
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:11.100]   speaking very generally, the glory has departed. The Christian church is in a very sad condition
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.780]   today, when you contrast what she is now with what she was in times past. Here in North
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.620]  ampton, without going any further, just over two hundred years ago, Northampton was one
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.540]   of the brightest spots in England as regards to the Christian faith. A great man lived
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.540]   here, and worked here at that time, and preached here. His name was Philip Doddridge. He died
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.580]   in 1751, and he was one of the bright stars in the firmament of the church. And Christianity
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.460]   counted and counted tremendously in this whole area at that time. Well, I don't think one's
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.500]   being unduly critical by suggesting that that is no longer the case. And Northampton is
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.260]   but a little kind of microcosm, if you like, of what is happening not only in the whole
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.100]   of this country, but in the whole of the world. We are living in degenerate days, not only
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.740]   morally but particularly religiously, and in the life of the church in a spiritual sense.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.940]   So as we meet today, we cannot but think of great days, great days in the history of the
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.540]   church. Now, this has been the history of the church from the beginning. She started
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.860]   in a blaze of glory on the day of Pentecost. But then that slowly passed away, and the
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.020]   church went down into the depths and seemed to be at an end. But God again revived his
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.820]   work. And what I want to try to show you is this, that the important, the vital factor
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:06:00.300]   always in the life of the church is the presence of the glory of God, the glory of the Lord.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.180]   The thing that is mentioned in both my texts, the thing that was mentioned in the hymn we
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:13.860]   sang, the second hymn which we sang, you remember, as Isaac Watts puts it like this, "My tongue
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.740]   repeats her vows, 'Peace to this sacred house, for there my friends and kindred dwell. And
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.420]   since my glorious God," that means the God of glory, "makes thee his blessed abode, my
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.020]   soul shall ever love thee well." Well, now I'm saying that what we are taught by these
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.580]   two portions of scripture is that what makes the church truly a church is the presence
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.420]   of the glory of God. I could easily show you this in the long history of the children of
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.900]   Israel, what a strange and chequered story it is. Times of great triumph, times of abject
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.300]   failure, miserable defeat. What was it that caused the variation in their story? Well,
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.660]   I think you'll find it's always this. It was the presence or the absence of God and his
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.820]   glory. When God was with them, nobody could withstand them. But when God wasn't with them,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.300]   they proved to be one of the weakest of the nations and constantly went down in defeat.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.580]   And what we've got in this fourth chapter of the first book of Semuel is one of these
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.420]   most tragic defeats in the history of these people. Never did they fall to a lower level.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.300]   They had gone down politically, religiously, and in the end even in a military sense, and
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.860]   were absolutely outrouted by the Philistines, who even went further and stole the Ark of
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:52.020]   the Covenant from them. And this woman cries out, "Echabod, for the glory of God, the glory
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:59.540]   of the Lord is departed from us." This then, I say, is the vital thing in connection with
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.300]   a church. This is what makes a church a church. The world, as you know, has got many institutions,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.980]   many societies, many clubs, people meet together in so many different ways. What makes a church
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:21.420]   different? Why is this place unique in this area now? Well, the answer is the presence
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:28.460]   of the glory of the Lord. But what always alarms me is this, is that it is possible
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:37.880]   for us to have so much, and yet not to have the presence of the glory of God. And our
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:46.020]   greatest danger, even today and at all times, is to be content with these other things,
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:54.340]   and to fail to realize that without this presence of God's glory, we are not only not functioning
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:01.580]   as a church, but finally our work is entirely in vain. Let me show you what I mean. And
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.740]   this is why I call attention to this last chapter of the Book of Exodus, which is a
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:14.060]   most fascinating chapter. It summarizes for us the building of that tabernacle, the tent
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:21.140]   of the congregation, in which the children of Israel were to worship. And there you can
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:28.620]   divide up that chapter into some three sections. The first one, from verse 1 to verse 16, gives
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:35.140]   us an account of God's instructions to Moses as to how he should build this tent or tabernacle
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.260]   of the congregation. "On the first day of the first month thou shalt set up the tabernacle
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.620]   of the tent of the congregation, and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.740]   and cover the ark with a veil, and thou shalt bring in the table," and on and on and on
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:57.620]   it goes, until you come to the end of verse 15. And thus we read in verse 16, "Thus did
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:04.780]   Moses, according to all that the Lord commanded him, so he did." God had given detailed plans
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.860]   and specifications as to how this building should be erected, how it should be furnished.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.180]   Everything was perfect. And we are told that Moses began and proceeded to do this. Verse
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.100]   17, "And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.340]   month, that the tabernacle was reared up. And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.660]   his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:40.340]   his pillars," and so on, and so on, and so on. He had been given detailed instructions,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:47.460]   he carried them out in a detailed manner. And so you go on until the end of verse 33.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:57.540]   And there at the end of verse 33 we read, "So Moses finished the work." Well, how then?
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.980]   All is well, isn't it? We've finished. God has given the instructions, the plans, and
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.100]   the specifications, and Moses has carried them out in detail. And there they had a beautiful
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.300]   new building. Everything seemed to be perfect. Everything, according to the precise measurements,
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.860]   every bit of furniture in position. Well, that's the end, isn't it? What more do you
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.420]   need? Wonderful building, all neat, just the thing that is required.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:36.100]   Now here, you see, is the vital point. I go on and I read, "So Moses finished the work.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:44.880]   Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.260]   And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:57.500]   thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:06.860]   My message really this afternoon is just this, that our greatest danger is to stop with the
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:15.380]   mechanical erection of the tabernacle. "So Moses finished the work." And we tend to stop
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.820]   at that point. But if we do, we haven't got a church, we've got a building only. And this
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.500]   is, to me, the terrible danger. There's always been this conflict in the long history of
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:35.740]   the church, as between this part that is done by Moses, by man, and this part that belongs
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:43.820]   to God. Now the great danger in this century has been to stop with man's part, with Moses'
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:49.460]   part, and to feel that as long as you've got a good building and a good organization and
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:56.780]   so on, that you've got everything you need. And the vital element is entirely forgotten.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.940]   But then of course there are other people today, and there have been throughout the
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:07.620]   long story of the church, who put their entire emphasis on God's side, and are not at all
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:14.260]   interested in man's part. They don't like any sort of organization. They claim to be
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:22.780]   purely spiritual. But according to this teaching, both are wrong. Both these elements are absolutely
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:28.580]   essential. There is the part that man has to play, there is the part that God alone
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:36.740]   can play. And they're both essential to the true functioning of the church. And we must
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:44.580]   never stop, simply, at our level, at what we can do. Now I think, without being at all
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.340]   unfair or unduly critical, that this has been the tragedy, as I say, of this present century.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.420]   The church has never been so highly organized, I'm speaking generally. Never have you had
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:01.500]   so many organizations and institutions, never has there been so much activity. And yet the
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.420]   church has counted less and less in the life of this country, and of this community. And
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:15.060]   I believe it is for that reason, that we've concentrated only on what men can do, and
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:23.740]   have forgotten that without this element of God's activity, the coming of the glory, it
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:31.140]   is all in vain. Now this can be illustrated quite easily in the long history of the church.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:39.620]   I've sometimes told the story of when I heard an old preacher saying, back in 1913, I was
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.660]   in a great meeting celebrating the bicentenary of the birth of one of the great Methodist
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.300]   preachers of 200 years ago, one of the great Welsh Methodist preachers, a man called Daniel
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.900]   Rowland. And a number of men were speaking on this occasion, and this old man was the
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.020]   last speaker. And I remember distinctly what he said, I don't remember a word of what the
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.420]   other said, but I remember what this man said, and it was because of this wonderful illustration
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.020]   that he used. He simply said what he said in the illustration, and no more. And this
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:14.980]   was his story. He happened to live in the town of Swansea. And he told us how he began
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.460]   to notice one day when he was walking around that some men were digging up a road, and
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.620]   he wondered what they were doing. And later on he found that they were putting some rails
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.780]   down. And he wondered what these were for. Then after a while he saw them putting up
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.500]   some great poles, one here, then another at a given distance, another at a given, the
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.420]   same given distance beyond, and so on. And then eventually he found they put some sort
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:45.540]   of wire from the top of these posts, one to the other. And he began to hear that they
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:51.900]   were going to have an electric tram car system. So he was quite excited about this. And the
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.820]   next day came when, taking his walk, he saw the most beautiful carriage on the rails.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.580]   And it was beautifully painted, and he saw that there was a downstairs section and an
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.820]   upstairs section. He was allowed to go inside, and there were seats which he could reverse,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:13.180]   he could travel either way. And it was perfect, painted beautifully, varnished. And you could
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.940]   sit down in it, and he sat down in it. But it didn't move. It was a carriage on rails,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:24.980]   and there was nothing left to be desired. But it didn't move. It didn't take you anywhere.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.980]   And then a great day came when this electric tram car system was to be opened. And a member
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:35.140]   of the royal family went down from London to Swansea to open it. And he described what
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:42.220]   had happened. There was a great pole on top of this tram car, tied down. And all the member
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:48.660]   of the royal family did was to pull a cord, which released this pole. The pole then made
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:55.300]   contact with this wire that was ahead, an electric wire. And the moment that happened,
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.700]   the tram car was able to move. Now it was a perfect tram car before, but it didn't move.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.900]   It couldn't move. It couldn't move until it was connected with the power that was in these
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:14.580]   electric cables. His point was that that is what Daniel Rowland had done. He'd just pulled
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:21.780]   the cord and it connected a motionless, lifeless church with the power of God and with the
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.060]   glory of God. And everything began to move. Well, now that's an interesting parable, isn't
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.340]   it? And it illustrates what we are told in these two incidents this afternoon. You can
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.620]   have a marvelous building such as you've got here this afternoon, but without the presence
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:45.180]   of the glory and the power of God, it's nothing but another building. And it really is not
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:51.500]   a church. A building never makes a church. Even people in a building don't make a church.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:59.540]   It's not truly a church until the glory of God comes down upon us. Very well. That's
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.620]   the first great lesson. Let me hurry on to a second. The most important thing, therefore,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:13.420]   for us is to be sensitive, isn't it, to the presence of the glory and the power of God.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.580]   This is the most important thing in the life of the church. I'm not saying, again, it's
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:23.420]   the only thing. Of course it isn't. These other things are essential. But the most important
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:30.180]   thing is this glory. And, therefore, the most important thing for us is to be sensitive
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:37.940]   to this. And this is why this incident at the end of this fourth chapter of 1 Samuel
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:44.220]   is to me always so fascinating. This woman, the daughter-in-law of the old man Eli, the
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:52.500]   high priest, she was the wife of Eli's son, Phineas. And you remember the story. She was
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   near to be delivered with child, and the news came of the terrible defeat of the army of
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.940]   Israel, and how the ark of God had been taken, and how her husband had been killed, and how
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.540]   her old father-in-law had died when he heard the news. And this gave her such a shock that
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:19.500]   she immediately gave birth to the child. And it was a male child, a boy. And we are told
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:27.300]   that the women that stood by her said unto her, "Fear not, for there was born a son."
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:33.140]   But she answered not, neither did she regard it. Do you realize the significance of that?
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.900]   What that really means is this. Those who are familiar with the Old Testament still
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:45.900]   will remember this. The greatest ambition of a Jewish woman was to give birth to a son.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:55.180]   This was the acme of her desire and her ambition, to give birth to a male child, a son. And
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.740]   they grieved if this didn't happen. But when it did happen, it was an occasion of great
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.220]   rejoicing. And this woman, the wife of Phineas, had been looking forward. Here she was to
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:11.380]   have a child, and she hoped and longed for it to be a male. Nothing greater, nothing
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:17.140]   better could happen to her. And at last she gives birth to a male child. But she's not
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.660]   rejoicing. And the women standing round and about her are amazed at this and say, "Fear
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:28.580]   not, what's the matter with you?" They say, "You gave birth to a son." It's an occasion
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   of great rejoicing and of happiness. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. And
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:43.340]   she named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory is departed from Israel." Because the
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.500]   ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. And she said, "The glory
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:57.060]   is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken." What it means is this, you see.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:06.980]   But this woman was a spiritual woman. And to her, the very birth of a son becomes nothing
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:15.140]   when the glory of God is departed from her church and from her people. She can't rejoice.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:23.340]   Even though her greatest desire has been gratified. Why? God, the glory of God is gone. The tragedy.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:30.100]   She was sensitive to this, and was therefore troubled and in an agony of soul when the
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.620]   glory of God had departed with the capturing of the ark by the Philistines.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:41.340]   Well now, here I say, is something that is most important for us who call ourselves Christians
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:47.780]   and members of churches at a time like this. Is this our greatest desire? Is this the thing
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:56.500]   that's uppermost in our minds? Is our central happiness determined by this? Can we be satisfied
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.340]   with anything less than this? Even today in various countries, there are great and prosperous
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.400]   churches with great organizations, marvelous finances. And yet there's little evidence
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.260]   of the glory of God. But people don't seem to be troubled. They've become unaware of
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:20.400]   this kind of thing. What's the matter? Well, they've ceased to be sensitive to the presence
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.800]   of the glory of God. This is the most terrible thing that can ever happen to a Christian
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:34.180]   person or to a group of Christian people, to cease to be sensitive to the presence of
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   the glory of God. The supreme example of this is the tragic men whose name was Samson in
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:47.540]   the Old Testament. He was a remarkable man, born in a remarkable manner, even unusual
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:53.220]   powers. God separated him, and his parents did the same in obedience to God. And he was
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:59.700]   an amazing man. And he could write the Philistines, and we're given endless stories of how he
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:07.180]   did so. His great and marvelous strength. But you remember the end of this man's story?
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:15.260]   He fell into sin, and he began to lose his sensitivity to the presence of God. And the
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:21.700]   final tragedy is something like this. A woman called Delilah that seduced him and entangled
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:28.740]   him, and he was so carried away by this that he really lost all his sense of values. And
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.460]   she was trying, of course, on behalf of the Philistines to get at the secret of his great
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:38.580]   strength, and he told her a number of stories, putting her off. He said, "You know, if they
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.540]   bind my hair," he said, "to the floor with pins, I'll be helpless." And they did so.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.060]   And the signal was given to the Philistines to come, and they came, and he just shook
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.700]   his head and he pulled out the pins. He told them to bind him with very strong cords. They
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:59.620]   did so. He broke them as if they were nothing. But at last she so pestered him that he revealed
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.300]   his secret to her, and said that it lay in his hair, and that if they shaved the hair
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:12.060]   of his head, he'd become as weak as other men. And so, while he was sleeping very deeply,
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.800]   she did this to him. And then this is the terrible story that we're told. She made him
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.860]   sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:27.380]   locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. And she
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.500]   said, "The Philistines be upon thee, Samson," as she had said on the previous occasions.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:39.920]   And he awoke out of his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times before and shake
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:50.580]   myself." And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. Poor Samson. He thought
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.780]   he could go on doing it, that this was something mechanical, but it wasn't. The glory had departed,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:04.460]   and he didn't know it. He wist not that the Lord had departed from him.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:10.180]   Now, my dear friends, we are living in a terrible period. I needn't waste your time or keep
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:16.100]   you in describing. You see the mounting problems in this country, politically, industrially,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.700]   socially, morally. The terrible condition into which we are getting, and we know that
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:26.500]   nothing but the message of the gospel is adequate at this present moment. Politics is failing,
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:33.180]   education, everything is failing. This alone can solve the problem. The church alone has
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:42.380]   the message. But the church is impotent without the presence of the glory of God. So the supreme
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:49.660]   thing for us is to be sensitive to this presence. The saints have always been sensitive. You
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:59.020]   remember some of these hymns of William Cowper? Remember how he cries out in his agony? "Where
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:07.980]   is the happiness I knew when first I sought the Lord?" Where is it? He's lost it. Here
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.060]   was a man who was sensitive, you see. He had known great blessing. He'd known the joy of
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.740]   the Lord and his presence in his life. But he seems to have missed it. Where is it? This
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:28.260]   thing which I had when first I sought the Lord. Where is that soul-refreshing view of
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:35.260]   Jesus and his word? And he longs for this to come back. Now, that's the thing I say
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:41.540]   that we need to cultivate. We're all experts at organization today. But the one need is
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:48.220]   the presence of the glory of God amongst us. How do we know this? How can this be known?
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:55.100]   Here, to me, is the most important question of all at a time such as this. That it humbles
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:02.140]   us. That, indeed, it alarms us. Let me give you perhaps what is the classical account
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:07.860]   of this. Again, it's in the Old Testament in the life of Jacob. You remember the story
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.420]   of Jacob. You've got a brother called Esau. And Jacob had behaved in rather an underhanded
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   manner. And Esau heard of it and brought Jacob to flee for his life. And off he goes on his
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.220]   journey. He runs, he walks, he's getting away as quickly as he can. At last he's tired out
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.300]   and he can't go any farther. So he decided he must have a rest and a sleep. He hadn't
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.660]   got pillows with him, but there was a stone there. So he put his head on the pillow, on
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:40.500]   this stone pillow, and he slept. And there, in his sleep and in his dream, he saw a ladder
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:46.700]   going from earth to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it. And
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:55.100]   then we are told that he awaked and Jacob awaked out of his sleep. And he said, "Surely
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:05.380]   the Lord is in this place. And I knew it not." And he was afraid and said, "How dreadful
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:15.540]   is this place. This is none other but the house of God. And this is the gate of heaven."
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:24.180]   What makes a place the house of God? The presence of God. God is in this place. It isn't a building
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.180]   that makes a house of God, as I've been trying to show you. It is the presence of
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:35.860]   God himself. God is in this place, says Jacob. Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.860]   it not. But the effect you see it had upon him was that he was afraid and said, "How
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:48.380]   full of dread is this place. This is none other but the house of God. And this is the
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:57.940]   gate of heaven." Christian people, what do we know of this awe in the presence of God?
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:04.140]   What do we know of this fearfulness? Isn't this the thing that's happening amongst us,
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.260]   that we've forgotten this? And we try to get a happy and a cheerful atmosphere. We
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:15.220]   bring in worldly methods of entertainment, and we all try to be jolly together. That's
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:22.820]   not a church. That's the world. When God is present, people are filled with awe, with
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:30.140]   reverence, with godly fear, invariably. That's only one example. Do you remember what we
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.900]   are told about the call of the great prophet Isaiah? Now here was a remarkable man, always
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:41.700]   a good man and a godly man from his very birth. But then he was called in the year that King
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:48.300]   Isaiah died. And we read, "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.980]   and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims, each one at six wings,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.540]   and so on. And one cried to another, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.700]   earth is full of his glory.' And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:10.900]   cried, and the house was filled with smoke." What effect did that have upon this good godly
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:20.620]   young man? Listen. "Then said I, 'Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:27.780]   unclean lips, and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine eyes have
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:38.780]   seen the King, the Lord of hosts." Same thing, a feeling of unworthiness, of fearfulness,
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:45.620]   at the presence of the glory and the holiness of God. You remember what we are told about
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.940]   Peter, the apostle Peter. He was a very bold, courageous, impulsive fellow. And one night
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.380]   he and others had gone out to fish, and they had caught nothing. And the Lord shouted to
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:01.060]   them, "From the shore, cast the net on the other side, and you'll catch." And they did.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.380]   And they caught so many that their net broke. And then they got back to the land. And this
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.780]   is what we are told, that Peter went to our Lord and said, "Depart from me, O Lord, for
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:18.100]   I am a sinful man." Why did he say that? Why did he feel like that? Our Lord hadn't reprimanded
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:25.620]   him. He'd said nothing to him. Oh, I can tell you, the miracle, the power of this person,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.820]   who simply says, "Throw the net on the other side." And there they catch so many that the
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.900]   net breaks. The glory, the power, the finger of God. And Peter felt it, and even that Peter
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:43.260]   was humbled and abased, felt fearful and alarmed. "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.460]   man." My dear friends, isn't this the note that's missing amongst us? We're much too
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:58.300]   healthy. We're much too pleased with ourselves and our organizations. What do we know about
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.060]   the fear of the Lord? Go to the last book of the Bible, and the Apostle John has one
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:09.220]   of his visions of this blessed risen Lord. What does he tell us? "I fell down as one
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:15.700]   dead." Read the stories of revivals in the history of the church. What happens? Oh, when
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:22.180]   God pours out his Spirit, when the glory comes, as it were. Do you know the first effect?
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:27.720]   People fall to the ground. I was only reading another account this morning of a great revival
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:33.340]   in the southern part of the United States at the beginning of the last century, 1801
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:40.580]   and 1802, when suddenly in Kentucky and North and South Carolina and other places, there
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.660]   was a great revival. And when it began, this is what happened. People were in a meeting,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.740]   nothing was happening, and they were not expecting anything. Suddenly something did happen, and
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:56.900]   some of them literally fell to the floor. The presence of God. Whenever you get revival,
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:04.980]   this is one of its first manifestations. A humbling, a breaking, a sense of awe, a sense
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:14.220]   of reverence, a sense of fear. My dear friends, are we sensitive to the presence of the glory
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:20.860]   of God? We've got a unique opportunity of reminding ourselves of that this afternoon.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:30.220]   Oh Moses, finish the work, the building, you've got it. Is God here? Are you going to be content
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:40.940]   with anything less than the obvious, sensible presence of the living God? Why is it, you
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:47.900]   think, that we tend to forget this? I mustn't keep you. But we do, don't we, all of us.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:53.060]   This is our greatest trouble. Why do we forget it? Well, many forget it because in a sense
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:59.820]   they've never known it. We've become so man-centered, we think we can do it by organizing. But we
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.140]   don't even think of it. It never enters the minds of so many people. And they're not aware
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:12.940]   therefore when the glory of God is not present amongst them. That's one reason. Another is,
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.580]   as it was here in the case of the children of Israel, disobedience, living a life of
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   sin. You read this chapter again when you go home and read the chapters before it, and
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:30.300]   you'll find that these two men, Hofner and Phinehas, the sons of the old high priest,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.460]   Levi, were sinful and dissolute men. They were using the priest's office to their own
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:42.900]   base unworthy sinful purposes. And the old man, Eli, had become so old he'd become indulgent
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.100]   he didn't reprimand them, he didn't chastise them and pull them up. Everything had become
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:55.520]   slack. And this led to all their defeats and all their troubles. They'd forgotten the holiness
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:02.620]   of God and they thought they could ride on tradition, live on the past. Can't be done.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:09.140]   The Holy Spirit is compared to a dove and he's sensitive. Another explanation is this.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.720]   Did you notice it in the reading at the beginning? You remember we are told that the children
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:21.300]   of Israel had been defeated in a battle by the Philistines. But some of them met together
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.980]   and they said, "Now look here." They said, "Let's plan together. Let's gather an army
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:32.180]   together and let's go up and challenge these Philistines once more to battle." And they
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:39.460]   did. But we are told that Israel was smitten before the Philistines and they slew of the
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.360]   army in the field about 4,000 men. But it's what happened then that interests me. When
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.300]   the people were coming to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.900]   us today before the Philistines?" See, they had a kind of post-mortem on the defeat. They
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:01.180]   said, "Now why did things go wrong?" And somebody got up and said, "I think I can tell you."
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.860]   He said, "You know, we made a fatal mistake. We gathered an army, that's all right, but
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:11.500]   we rushed into battle without taking the Ark of the Covenant with us." Now he said, "I
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:17.700]   make a proposal. Let's send for the Ark, let's gather an army together again, put the Ark
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.460]   in the center. Let's go up with our army with the Ark in the center and challenge these
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.180]   Philistines. Now then, this time we'll beat them because we'll have the Ark with us."
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:34.380]   This is what we are told. "Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.700]   unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:45.540]   So they sent to Shiloh, they got the Ark, and up they went, shouting, confident of victory.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.420]   Indeed, they were so assured and shouting so much that we are told that when the Philistines
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.540]   heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.140]   camp of the Hebrews?" And they understood that the Ark of the Lord was coming to the
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.220]   camp, and the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God is coming to the camp." And
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:09.180]   they said, "Woe is unto us, for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. Who shall
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.940]   deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.660]   with all the plagues of the wilderness. Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O you
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:26.460]   Philistines, that you be not servants unto the Hebrews." But what happened? Well, what
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:32.740]   happened was that the Philistines not only beat these Israelites again, they absolutely
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.460]   routed them, they decimated their army, they stole the Ark of the Covenant. It was one
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:43.580]   of the most abysmal defeats they ever suffered. But what's the message? Well, it's clear,
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:50.100]   isn't it? These foolish, sinful Israelites thought that they could use the Ark of the
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.980]   Covenant of the Lord as a mascot, something mechanical. Of course, the Philistines thought
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.240]   the same. You'd expect them to. You don't expect Philistines to have a spiritual understanding,
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.820]   but you do expect God's people to. And they said, you see, "Oh," they said, "we made the
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.380]   mistake of going up without the Ark. If only we have the Ark, then we are bound to succeed."
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:16.740]   A kind of mascot, wasn't it? A kind of magic wand? Some kind of talisman? That was their
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:24.260]   view of the Ark of the Lord. And God taught them this terrible lesson, that he's not confined
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.780]   to any Ark, to any box. He can't be used as a mascot just when we happen to remember him
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:39.020]   and then give us victory in a mechanical way. No, no. God is a person, he's a living God.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.500]   And it's because so many of us think that we can use and handle God as we choose. We
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.340]   forget him for months. When things go well, then we take an ill and we begin to pray.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.220]   Or somebody else has taken ill. Somebody very dear to us and we're in an agony. You've read
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.660]   of this so many times during the war and other times men torpedoed. And there they are in
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.780]   a boat and nobody's near them and they put up their flags, nobody sees them. And they
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.620]   confess it afterwards, that at last in their desperation somebody said, "What about praying?"
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.860]   They hadn't prayed for years, they hadn't thought of God for years. But in their extremity,
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:16.260]   yes. Like the people on that great ship, the Titanic in 1912, you remember. Steaming across
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:25.060]   the Atlantic, the unsinkable ship. Band playing its jazz music on a Sunday. Everything marvelous.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:31.460]   Suddenly the thud, they'd struck an iceberg. Do you remember what we were told? They realized
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.900]   that they were beginning to sink. And the band that had been playing the jazz music
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:42.700]   began to play, "Nearer, my God, to thee." We think we can use God, turn to him when we
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.860]   like, when we remember him. And that he's bound to bless us. My dear friends, these
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.460]   are the great lessons that are taught us in the Bible from beginning to end. If we have
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:58.660]   these false views of God and of his glory and of his presence, we can anticipate nothing
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:04.220]   but defeat and disaster. What are we to do then? Well, I close by putting it to you like
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:11.460]   this. There's only one thing to do. It's so obvious. It's to start by realizing that without
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:18.540]   God we can do nothing. We can build buildings, of course we can. We can multiply our institutions
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:27.940]   and our organizations. We're experts at it. But it all comes to nothing. Without God,
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:35.100]   without this glory, without his presence in the midst, we can do nothing. Our Lord taught
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:44.300]   us this. Apart from me, he can do nothing. This is the first great essential. What do
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:50.540]   we do then? Well, we keep his commandments, which means that we read his book and believe
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:58.740]   it and put it into operation, that we obey him. But even that isn't enough. What's needed
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:07.100]   further? The greatest need of the Church today, surely. We must plead with him to return.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:14.580]   We must not be content until we are aware of the glory in the midst. It'll frighten
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:19.780]   us, remember, as it frightened Moses. Did you notice that incident there in that fortieth
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:27.140]   chapter of Exodus? We are told that when the glory descended and filled the house, Moses
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.540]   couldn't go in. He was afraid to go in. Why? The presence of the glory of the Lord. Moses
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.260]   had been going in and out of the building probably every day, watching the work, seeing
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:42.300]   that everything was perfect, no trouble. But when God comes, fear. And we must be prepared
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:50.500]   for this. That means we'll be humbled. Then we'll cry out into him. We'll plead with him.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:57.020]   As poor William Cowper did, in the hymn I've already quoted partially, "Return, O holy
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:07.020]   dove, return, sweet messenger of rest. I hate the sin that made thee mourn and drove thee
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:16.140]   from my breast." As the old fathers used to put it, "We don't really pray until this O
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:28.460]   comes in. Return, O holy dove, return, sweet messenger of rest." We must plead with him
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:36.740]   to come back amongst us, to manifest the glory of his power. And when he does, believe me,
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.780]   whatever the forces that may be against the church, they'll become as nothing. They'll
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:49.820]   vanish. They'll be routed. And the church will again be victorious because she is the
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:43:00.220]   church of the living God. So Moses finished the work. Excellent. Thank God you've got
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:12.060]   the building. But in the name of God, don't stop here. Then, that's the thing. The coming
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:21.980]   of the glory. And giving yourselves no rest nor peace until he has come. And you're amazed
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:32.940]   and astonished. At first frightened, but then filled with a sense of wonder, love, and praise
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:41.420]   at the presence of the living God. Amen.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:45.500]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
