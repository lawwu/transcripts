[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   And I don't say this to any disrespect to L.A.
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.720]   Some people can be in L.A. too long.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.780]   Do you get what I'm saying when I say that?
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.540]   Did you not see my viral quote saying that?
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.940]   You've been in L.A. too long, nigga.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.780]   Somebody asked me a question, and I answered it a certain way,
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.600]   and then he answered it a certain way, and I was like,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.120]   ah, bro, you've been in L.A. too long.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.740]   Because I literally said, what do you mean by that?
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520]   There's a thing about L.A. that L.A.'s biggest export is entertainment.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.860]   I've just seen it happen too much, where somebody moves to L.A.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.300]   What can happen is if you stay there too long, there's an air that you breathe.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.560]   Everyone's trying to get ahead.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.360]   Everyone's trying to become the next movie star, the next rapper,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.420]   and you don't know if they're willing to step on you to get there.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.640]   If you stay there too long, it can kind of harden you.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.760]   They've been in L.A. too long to where that's just the natural culture,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240]   to where they don't even realize that they are using people,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.460]   because that's just how it is there.
