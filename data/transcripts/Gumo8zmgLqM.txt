[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Robert Moses represented a past that's, you know, a time when we wanted to build bridges and super
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.720]   highways and things that pretty much is going on. We're not building super highways now.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   We're not building vast bridges like Moses built all the time. Essentially, all the big roads,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:26.640]   all the bridges, all the parks, the United Nations, Lincoln Center, the World's Fairs of 1939 and 1964,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.480]   and hundreds of other things he built. Had Robert Moses not lived, not done what he did,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.960]   New York would have followed the trail of maybe Detroit. And I think it was the best book I ever
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.680]   read. In broad strokes, it's correct. Robert Moses had more power than any urban figure in American
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.920]   history. He built incredible monuments. He was ruthless and arrogant and honest.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.760]   Okay, I am really, really excited about this one. Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.680]   Professor Kenneth T. Jackson about the life and legacy of Robert Moses. Professor Jackson is the
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.640]   preeminent historian on New York City. He was the director of the Herbert H. Lehman Center for
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.000]   American History and the Jacques Barzun Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.760]   where he has also chaired the Department of History. And we will be discussing Robert Moses.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   Professor Jackson is the author and editor of Robert Moses and the Modern City,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.480]   the Transformation of New York. Professor Jackson, welcome to the podcast.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.400]   Well, thank you for having me.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   Okay, so many people will have heard of Robert Moses and be vaguely aware of him through the
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.920]   popular biography of him by Robert Caro, the power broker. But most people will not be aware
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.200]   of the extent of his influence on New York City. Can you give a kind of a summary of the things he
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.680]   was able to get built in New York City? One of the best comparisons I can think of is that
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.360]   Arcaros himself, when he compared him to Christopher Wren in London, he said if you
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.120]   would see his monument, look around, it's almost more easier to talk about what Moses didn't do
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.880]   than what he did do. If you, all the roads, essentially all the big roads, all the bridges,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.320]   all the parks, the United Nations, Lincoln Center, the World's Fairs of 1939 and 1964,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.320]   and hundreds of other things he built. I mean, he didn't actually do it with his own two hands,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   but he was in charge. He got it done. And Robert Caro wrote a really great book. I think the book
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.560]   was flawed because I think Caro only looked at Moses' own documents and Moses had a very
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   narrow view of himself. I mean, he thought he was a great man, but I mean, he didn't pay any
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.320]   attention to what was going on in L.A. very much, for example. But clearly, by any standard,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   he's the greatest builder in American history. There's nobody really in second place. And not
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   only did he build and spend this vast amount of money, and he was in power for a long time,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.160]   really a half century more or less. And he had a singular focus. You know, he was married,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.360]   but his personal life was not important to him. He did it without scandal, really. Even Caro
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   admits that he really died with less than he started with. So, I mean, he wanted power.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.160]   And he had, boy, did he have power. He technically was subservient to governors and mayors, but
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.520]   since he built so much and since he had multiple jobs, that was part of his secret. He had
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   you know, as many as six, eight, ten different things at once. If the mayor fired him or got
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.840]   rid of him, he had all these different ways, which he was in charge of that the mayor couldn't. So,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   you were afraid. You people were afraid of him. And they also respected him. He was very smart.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   And he worked for a dollar a year. So, what are you going to get him for? As Caro says,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.880]   nobody is ready to be compared with Robert Moses. In fact, compares him with an act of nature.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.240]   In other words, the person you can compare him with is God. You know, that's the person. He put
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   the rivers in. He put the hills in. He put the island in. Compare that to Moses, what Moses did.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.520]   No other person could compare to that. You know, that's a little bit of exaggeration. But when you
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.840]   really think about Robert Moses and you read The Power Broker, you are stunned by the scope of his
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   achievement. Just stunned. And even beyond New York, when we build, think of the interstate
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.760]   highway system, which really starts in 1954, '55, '56, and which is, you know, 40-something thousand
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.720]   miles of interstate highways. Those were built by Moses men, people who had, in their young life,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.680]   had worked with the parkways and expressways in and around New York City. So, they were ready to
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.880]   go. And so, Moses and Moses also worked outside New York City, mostly inside New York City. But
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.160]   he achieved so much. So, partly you need to understand it's not easy to get things done
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.800]   in New York. It's very, very dense, much twice as dense as any place in the United States.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   And full of neighborhoods that feel like little cities, and are little cities,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.800]   and that don't want change. Even today, a place like Austin, for example, is heavy into development,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.600]   not New York. You want to build a tall building in New York, you got to fight for it, you know?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   So, and the fact that he did so much in the face of opposition speaks a lot to his methods and the
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.400]   way he—how did Moses do what he did? That is a huge question because it isn't happening anymore,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.360]   certainly not in New York City. Yeah, and that's really why I actually wanted to talk to you and
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.000]   talk about this book because, you know, The Power Broker was released in 1974, and at the time,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.360]   New York was not doing well, which is to put it mildly. But today, the crisis we face is one where
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.280]   we haven't built significant public works in many American cities for decades. And so it's
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.920]   interesting to look back on a time when we could actually get a lot of public works built very
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:58.800]   quickly and very efficiently, and see if, like, maybe we got our characterization of the people
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.440]   at the time wrong. And that's where your 2007 book comes in. So I'm curious, how was the book
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.080]   received 50 years after—or I guess 40 years after The Power Broker was released? What was the
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.720]   reception like? How has the intellectual climate around these issues changed in that time?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   The Power Broker is a stunning achievement, but you're right. It's The Power Broker, colon,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.600]   Robert Moses, and the fall of New York. He's thinking that in the 1970s, which is the—in
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.840]   New York's 400-year history, we think of the 1970s as being the bottom. City was bankrupt,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   crime was going up, corruption was all around, nothing was working very well.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.680]   My argument in the subtitle of the 2007 book, or that article, is Robert Moses and the rise of New
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.880]   York, arguing that had Robert Moses not lived, not done what he did, New York would have followed
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.560]   the trail of maybe Detroit and St. Louis and Cincinnati and Pittsburgh and most cities in
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.920]   the Northeast and Midwest, which really declined. New York City really hasn't declined. It's got
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   more people now than it ever did. It's still the number one city in the world, really, by most
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:26.480]   standards. It's the global leader, maybe along with London. At one point in the 1980s, we thought it
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   might be Tokyo, which is the largest city in the world, but it's no longer considered competitive
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.880]   with New York and maybe—I say London, too, because New York and London are kind of alone at the top.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   But I think Robert Moses, public works, activities—I just don't know that you can have a
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.400]   New York City and not have expressways. I don't like the Cross Bronx Expressway either and don't
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.040]   want to drive on it. But how can you have a world in which you can't go from Boston to San Francisco?
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:06.480]   You had to have it. You have to have some highways. And Carroll had it exactly wrong.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:13.280]   He talked about Moses and the decline of public transit in New York. Actually,
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.640]   what you need to explain in New York is why public transit survived in New York,
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.120]   where in most other American cities, the only people who use public transit are the losers,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.360]   old, the disabled, the poor, and stuff like that. In New York City, rich people ride the subway.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.320]   It's simply the most efficient way to get around and the quickest. And so that question needs—some
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   of the things need to be turned on its head. How did he get it done? How did he do it without
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.560]   scandal? I mean, when you think about how the world is in our time, when everything has either
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:56.080]   a financial scandal or a sexual scandal attached to it, Moses didn't have scandals. He built the
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.600]   White Stone Bridge, for example, which is a gigantic bridge connecting the Bronx to Queens.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.160]   It's beautiful. It was finished in the late 1930s, on time and under budget. Actually,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.360]   a little earlier. There's no such thing as that now. You're going to do a big public works project,
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.880]   and you're going to do it on time. And also, he did it well. Jones Beach, for example,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.000]   for generations, has been considered one of the great public facilities on earth. I mean,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.400]   it's gigantic. And he created it. I know people would say, "It's just sand and water." No, no,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.640]   it's a little more complicated than that. So everything he did was complicated.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.840]   I mean, I think Robert Caro deserves a lot of credit for doing research on Moses, his childhood,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:55.520]   his growing up, his assertion that he's the most important person ever to live in and around New
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   York. And just think of Franklin Roosevelt and all the people who lived in and around New York.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   And Moses is in a category by himself, even though most Americans have never heard of Robert Moses.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:17.920]   So his fame is still not…that book made him famous. And I think his legacy will continue to
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:27.200]   evolve, and I think slightly improve, as Americans realize that it's hard to build public works,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.560]   especially in dense urban environments. And he did it.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Yeah. There's so much to talk about there. But one of the interesting things from The Power
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:46.560]   Broker is Caro is trying to explain why governors and mayors who were hesitant about the power that
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.320]   Moses was gaining continued to give him more power. And there's a section where he's talking
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.080]   about how FDR would keep giving him more positions and responsibilities, even though FDR and Moses
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.320]   famously had a huge enmity. And he says, "No governor could look at the difficulty of getting
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.560]   things built in New York and not admire and respect Moses' ability to do things, as you said,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.040]   efficiently, on time, under budget, and not need him, essentially."
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:23.200]   But speaking of scandal, you talked about how he didn't take salary for his 12 concurrent
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:30.400]   government roles that he was on. But there's a very arresting anecdote in The Power Broker where
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   I think he's 71, and his daughter gets cancer. And for the first time, he had to accept -- maybe
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.320]   I'm getting the details wrong -- but he had to accept salary for working on the World's Fair
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:48.480]   because he was the most powerful person in New York, and he didn't have enough money to pay for
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.720]   his daughter's cancer. And even Caro himself says that a lot of the scandals that came later in his
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.600]   life, they were just kind of trivial stuff, like an acre of Central Park or Shakespeare in the park.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.920]   Things that actually took him down were just trivial scandals.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:15.040]   Well, in fact, when he finally was taken down, it took the efforts of a person who was almost
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.200]   considered the second most powerful person in the United States, David Rockefeller, and the
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.120]   governor of New York, both of whom were brothers. And they still had to lie to Moses to make him
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:34.880]   kind of get out of power in 1968. But it was time, and he exercised power into his 70s and 80s,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:42.160]   and most of it was good. I mean, the bridges are remarkable. The bridges are gorgeous, mostly.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:49.440]   They're incredible. The Throgs Neck Bridge, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the Triborough Bridge,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.160]   they're really works of art. And he liked to build things you could see.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:05.760]   And I think the fact that he didn't take money was important to him. You know, he was not poor.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.800]   I wouldn't say he was not wealthy in New York terms, but he was not a poor person. He went to
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.280]   Yale as a Jewish person, and let's just say in the early 20th century, that's fairly unusual.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.080]   And he lived well. So we can't say he's poor. But I think that Moses, that Carroll was right
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:32.640]   in saying that what Moses was after in the end was not sex and not power, not sex and not money,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:39.840]   power. He wanted power. And boy, did he get it. Well, there's a good review of the book from,
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.000]   I'm not sure if I remember the last name, but it was Philip Lopgate or something.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.960]   Lopate, I think.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:54.240]   Okay. And he made a good point, which was that the connotation of the word power is very negative,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.680]   but it's kind of a modern thing really to have this sort of attitude towards power that like
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:07.600]   somebody who's just seeking it must necessarily have suspicious motivations. If Moses believed,
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.280]   and in fact, he was probably right in believing that he was just much more effective at building
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:22.000]   public works for the people that live in New York, was it irrational of him or was it selfish of him
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.480]   to just desire to work 14-hour days for the 40 years on end and accumulate the power by which
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   he could build more public works? So there's a way of looking at it where this pursuit of power is
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.480]   not itself troubling.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.360]   Well, first of all, I just need to make a point that it was not just New York City. I mean,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.680]   Jones Beach is on Long Island. A lot of those highways, the Northern State Parkway, the Southern
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.760]   State Parkway, were built outside the city. And also big projects, the power authority in upstate
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.520]   New York. He also was consultant around the world in cities and transportation. So his influence
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.720]   was really felt far beyond New York City. And of course, New York City is so big and so important.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   I think also that we might want to think about, at least I think so,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:16.320]   what do you want to say the counterfactual argument? Can you imagine? I can't remember
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.920]   when I was in the Air Force, we lived next door to a couple from New York City. We didn't know
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.120]   New York City at the time. And I can't remember whether she or he was from the Bronx or Brooklyn,
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:36.640]   but they made us understand how incredibly much he must have loved her to go to Brooklyn or the
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.840]   Bronx to see her and pick her up for dates and stuff like this. You couldn't get there. I mean,
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.760]   it would take you three hours to go from the Rockaways in Brooklyn to somewhere in the Northern
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.600]   Bronx. But the roads that Moses built, I know at rush hour they're jammed, but right this minute
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.240]   on a Sunday, you can whiz around New York City on these expressways that Moses built.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:11.120]   It's hard to imagine New York without. The only thing Moses didn't do was the subway.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.720]   And many people have criticized him because the subways were deteriorated between the time they
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.480]   were built in the early part of the 20th century in 1974 when Carroll wrote The Power Broker.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.120]   But so had public transit systems all over the United States. And the public transit system in
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:36.320]   New York is now better than it was 50 years ago. So that trajectory has changed. And all these
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.600]   other cities, you know, Pittsburgh used to have 600,000 people. Now it has 300,000.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.960]   Cleveland used to have 900,000 and something. Now it's below five. Detroit used to have 2 million.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:57.520]   Now it's 600-something thousand. St. Louis used to have 850,000. Now it's 300. I mean, the steep
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:04.080]   drop in all these other cities in the Midwest and Northeast, even Washington and even Boston
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:10.640]   and Philadelphia, they all declined except New York City, which even though it was way bigger
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:17.360]   than any of them in 1950, is bigger now than it was then. More people crammed into this small space.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.880]   And Moses had something to do with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You write in the book,
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.320]   and I apologize for quoting you back to yourself, but you write, "Had the city not undertaken a
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.480]   massive program of public works between 1924 and 1970, had it not built the arterial highway system
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.080]   and had it not relocated 200,000 people from old law tenements to new public housing projects,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.040]   New York would not have been able to claim in the 1990s that it was a capital of the 20th century."
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.160]   I would like to make this connection more explicit. So what is the reason for thinking
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.640]   that if New York hadn't done urban renewal and hadn't built the more than 600 miles of highways
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.920]   that Moses built there, that New York would have declined like these other cities in the Northeast
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   and the Midwest? Well, I mean, you could argue, first of all, and friends of mine have argued
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.480]   this, that New York is not like other cities. It's a world city and has been. And what happened
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:21.280]   to the rest of the United States is, I accept a little bit of that, but not all of it. You say,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.880]   well, New York is just New York. And so whatever happens here is not necessarily because of Moses
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.520]   or different from Detroit, but I think it's important to realize its history has been
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.720]   different from other American cities. Most American cities, especially the older cities,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:46.240]   have been in relative decline for 75 years. And in some ways, New York has too. In other words,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.680]   its relative dominance of the United States is less now because there's been a shift
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.960]   South and West in the United States. But the prosperity of New York, the desire of people
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.840]   to live in it, and after all, one of its problems is it's so expensive. Well, one reason it's
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.200]   expensive is people want to live there. If they didn't want to live there, it would be like
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.520]   Detroit. It'd be perfectly free. You know what I mean? So there are answers to these issues,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:23.040]   but Moses' ways, I think, were interesting. First of all, he didn't worry about legalities. He would
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:32.320]   start an expressway through somebody's property and dare a judge to tell him to stop after the
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.800]   construction had already started. And most of the time, Moses, he was kind of like Hitler. I don't
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.520]   mean to say he was like Hitler, but what I mean is you have such confidence. You just do things
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.280]   and dare other people to change it. You know what I mean? I'm going to do it. And most people don't
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.240]   have that. I think there's a little bit of that in Trump, but not as much. I mean, I don't think
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:09.440]   he has nearly the genius or brains of Moses, but there's something to self-confidence. There's
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:20.800]   something to having a broad vision. Moses liked cities, but he didn't like neighborhoods or
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.040]   people. In other words, I don't think he loved New York City. Here's the person who's more
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.800]   involved. He really thought everybody should live in suburbs and drive cars. And that was the world
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.680]   of the future, and he was going to make that possible. And he thought all those old law
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.880]   tenements in New York, which is really anything built before 1901, were slums, and they didn't
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.080]   have hot and cold water, often didn't have bathrooms. He thought they should be destroyed.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:59.040]   And his vision was public housing, high-rise public housing, was an improvement. Now,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.560]   I think around the United States, we don't think these high-rise public housing projects are so
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:11.440]   wonderful, but he thought he was doing the right thing. And he was so arrogant. He didn't listen
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:18.240]   to people like Jane Jacobs, who fought him and said, "You're saying Greenwich Village is a slum?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.680]   Are you kidding me?" I mean, he thought it was a slum. Go to Greenwich Village today. Try to buy
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.240]   anything for under a million dollars. I mean, it doesn't exist. You know what I mean? I mean,
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:36.560]   Greenwich Village, and he saw old things, old neighborhoods, walking is hopelessly out of date,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:44.240]   and he was wrong. He was wrong about a lot of his vision. And now we understand that. And all
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.480]   around the country, we're trying to revitalize downtowns and reduce our dependence on fossil
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.080]   fuels and gasoline and cars. But Moses didn't see the world that way. It's interesting. He never
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:03.200]   himself drove a car. Can you believe that the man who had more influence on the American car
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   culture, probably even than Henry Ford, himself was always driven. He was a chauffeur. In fact,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:18.160]   he was so busy that Carol talks about him as having two limousines behind each other,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.920]   and he would have a secretary in one, and he would be dealing with business and writing letters and
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.640]   things like this. And then she would have all she could do. They would pull off to the side of the
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.200]   road. She would get out of his car. The car that was following would discharge the secretary in
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.320]   that car. They would switch places, and the fresh secretary would get in the backseat of Moses,
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.800]   and they would continue to work. And the first secretary would go to type up whatever she had
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:53.600]   to do. He worked all the time. He really didn't have much of a private life. There are not many
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.720]   people like Robert Moses. There are people like Robert Moses, but not so many. And he achieved
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:11.760]   his ideal. I think that there are so many ironies there. Not only did he not drive himself. He
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:19.120]   didn't appreciate so much the density of New York, which many people now love, and it's getting more
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.560]   dense. They're building tall buildings everywhere. And he didn't really appreciate the diversity,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:32.400]   the toleration. He himself didn't care about that, but it worked. And I just think we have to
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.800]   appreciate the fact that he did what was impossible, really impossible, and nobody else could
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.080]   have done what he did. And if we hadn't done it then, he sure as heck wouldn't be able to do it
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.120]   in the 21st century, when people are even more litigious. You try to change the color of a door
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   in New York City, and you try to do something positive, like build a free swimming pool,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.600]   fix up an old armory and turn it into a public, there'll be people who'll fight you. I'm not
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.520]   kidding this. And Moses didn't care. He says, "I'm going to do this." When he built the Cross
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:16.480]   Bronx Expressway, which in some ways, it was horrible what he did to these people. But again,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:23.520]   Carroll mischaracterizes what happened. But it's a dense working class, let's call it Jewish
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:30.800]   neighborhood in the early 1950s. And Roses decides we need an interstate highway or a big highway
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:39.600]   going right through it. Well, he sent masses of people letters that said, "Get out in 90 days."
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.960]   He didn't mean 91 days. He meant, he didn't mean let's argue about it for four years.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.520]   Let's get legit. Moses meant the bulldozers will be bulldozing. And that kind of attitude,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.280]   we just don't have anymore. And it's kind of funny now to think back on it, but it wasn't funny to
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:03.920]   the people who got evicted. But again, as I say, it's hard to imagine a New York City without the
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   Cross Bronx Expressway. Even it tore down five blocks of dense buildings, tore them down and
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.720]   built this road right through it. You live, and they didn't worry about where they're going to
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:23.920]   rehouse them. I mean, they did, but it didn't work. And now it's so busy, it's crowded all the time.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.240]   So what does this prove? That we need more roads, but you can't have more roads in New York because
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.520]   if you build more roads, what are you gonna do with the cars? Right now, the problem is
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.760]   there's so many cars in the city, there's nothing to do. It's easy to get around in New York,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.360]   but what are you gonna do with the car? The car culture has the seeds of its own destruction.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:50.320]   Cars, just parking them or putting them in a garage is a problem. And Moses didn't foresee
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.080]   those. He foresee you're all gonna live in the Long Island suburbs or Westchester suburbs or
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:03.280]   New Jersey suburbs, park your car in your house and come in the city to work. Now the city is
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.920]   becoming a place to live more than a place to work. So what they're doing in New York as fast
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.400]   as they can is converting office buildings into residential units. He would never have seen that,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.920]   that people would want to live in the city, who had options, that they would reject the single
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.280]   family house and choose high rise and choose the convenience of going outside and walking to a
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.400]   delicatessen over driving to a grocery store. It's a world he never saw. Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   like the thing you pointed out earlier about him having the two limousines and then the enormous
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.560]   work ethic and then he had the 90 day eviction. I mean, I'm a programmer and I can recognize this
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.840]   trope immediately, right? Robert Moses was the startup founder, but in government, you know,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.160]   that attitude is like, yeah, it's like Silicon Valley. That's like, we all recognize that.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.000]   And I think we should go back to what you said earlier about why was it that governors or mayors
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   couldn't tell him what to do? Because there are many scenes in The Power Broker where he will
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.680]   go to the mayor who wants to do something else and Moses would, damn it, he'd say, damn it,
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   throw his pages on the desk and say, sign this. This is my resignation. You know, okay. And I'm
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:31.920]   out of here because the mayors and governors love to open bridges and highways and do it efficiently
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.720]   and beautifully. And Moses could do that. Moses could deliver. And the workers loved him because
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:49.840]   he paid union wages, good wages to his workers. And he got things done and things like more than
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:59.040]   700 playgrounds. And it wasn't just grand things. And even though people criticize the 1964 World's
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:06.000]   Fair as a failure, and financially it was a failure, but still tens of millions of people
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.360]   went there and had a good time. You know, I mean, even some of the things were supposedly were
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:18.240]   failures. Failures according to whom? According to the investment banker, maybe, but not to the
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.000]   people who went there. Right. Yeah. And I mean, the point about the governors and mayors needing
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.280]   him, it was especially important to have somebody who could like work that fast. If you were going
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.160]   to get reelected in four years or two years, you need somebody who can get public works done faster
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.720]   than they're done today. Right. If you want to be there for the opening. Yeah, exactly. And it's
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.280]   important to realize, to say that Moses did try public office once. He ran for governor. And I
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.880]   think it's true that he lost by more than anybody in the history of New York. It was not, you know,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.280]   he was not an effective public speaker. He was not soft and friendly and warm and cuddly. That's not
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:03.040]   Robert Moses. The voters rejected him. But the people who had power and also Wall Street, because
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:10.640]   he had to issue bonds. And one of the ways that Moses had power was he created this thing called
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.600]   the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to build the Triborough Bridge. Well, now,
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.800]   if in Portland, Oregon, you want to build a bridge or a road, you issue a couple hundred
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:27.120]   million dollars worth of bonds to the public and assign a value to it, interest rate that's paid
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.800]   off by the revenue that comes in from the bridge or the road or whatever it is. Normally, before
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:43.920]   normally you would build a public works and pay for it itself on user fees. And when the user fees
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:50.080]   paid it off, it ended. But what Moses, who was called the best bill drafter in Albany,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:31:00.560]   which was a Moses term, he said he was somewhere down in paragraph 13, section Z, say, and the
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:08.800]   chairman can only be removed for cause. What that meant was when you buy a bond for the Triborough
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:15.760]   Bridge or something else, you're in a contract that's supported by the Supreme Court. This is
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.800]   a financial deal you're making with somebody. And part of the contract was the chairman gets to stay
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   unless he does something wrong. Well, Moses was careful not to do anything wrong. And it also
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.840]   would continue. You would get the bond for the Triborough Bridge, but rather than pay off the
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.880]   Triborough Bridge, he would build another project. It would give him the right to continue to build
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.680]   this chain of events. And so he had this massive pot of money from all these initially nickels and
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.760]   dimes, Brazil made up a lot of money, the '30s and '40s and '50s and '60s, to spend more money and
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:58.000]   build more bridges and build more roads. And that's where he had his power. And the Wall Street,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.960]   the big business, loved him because they're issuing the bonds. The unions loved him because
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:09.680]   they're paying the investors. Now, what Carroll says is that Moses allowed the investors an extra
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.320]   quarter percent, I think a quarter percent or half percent on the bonds, but they all sold out.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:25.440]   So everybody was happy. And was that crooked? It wasn't really illegal, but it's the way people do
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.080]   that today. If you're issuing a bond, you've got to figure out what interest am I going to pay on
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   this that will attract investors now. And the crucial thing about these tales of graft is that
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.920]   it never was about Moses trying to get rich. It was always him trying to push through a project.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:48.560]   And obviously, that can be disturbing, but it is a completely different category of thing,
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.240]   especially when you remember that this was a corrupt time in New York history. This is after
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.320]   Tammany Hall and so on. So it's completely different from somebody using their projects
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:03.280]   to get themselves rich. But I do want to actually talk in more detail about the impact of these
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:10.000]   roads. So obviously, the current system we have today where we just treat cities as living museums
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.200]   with NIMBYism and historical preservation, that's not optimal. But there are examples,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.560]   at least if Cairo is right, about Moses just throwing out thousands of people carelessly,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.920]   famously in that chapter on the One Mile, how Moses could have diverted the Cross Bronx Express
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.840]   by one mile and prevented thousands of people from getting needlessly evicted.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.080]   So I'm just going to list off a few criticisms of his highway building,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   and then you can respond to them in any order you want. So one of the main criticisms that
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.720]   Cairo makes is that Moses refused to add mass transit to his highways, which would have helped
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.040]   deal with the traffic problem and the car problem and all these other problems at a time when
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.480]   getting the right of way and doing the construction would have been much cheaper. And because of his
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.560]   dislike for mass transit, he just refused to do that. And also, the prolific building of highways
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:14.480]   contributed to urban sprawl, it contributed to congestion, it contributed to neighborhoods
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:21.440]   getting torn apart if a highway would cross them. So a whole list of criticisms of these highways.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.360]   I'll let you take it in any order you want. Well, first of all, Moses' response was,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.800]   "I wasn't in charge of subways. So if you think the subways deteriorated or didn't build enough,
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   find out who was in charge of them and blame that person. I was in charge of highways,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.000]   and I built those." So that's the first thing. Before you answer that, can I just ask? So on
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.680]   that particular point, it is true that he wasn't in charge of mass transit, but also he wasn't in
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.080]   charge of roads until he made himself responsible for roads, right? So if he chose to, he could have
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   made himself responsible for mass transit and taking care of it. Maybe, although I think the
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.520]   other thing about it is putting Moses in a broader historical concept. He was swimming with the tide
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.960]   of history. And there was history when he was building, was building Ford Motor Company and
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.480]   General Motors and Chrysler Corporation and building cars by the millions. I mean, the
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.680]   automobile industry in the United States was huge. People thought any kind of rail transit was
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:30.320]   obsolete and on the way out anyway, so let's just build roads. I mean, that's what the public
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:36.720]   wanted. He built what the public wanted. It's not what I was looking historically. I don't think we
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.200]   did the right thing, but we needed to join the 20th century. New York could have stayed as a quaint,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.040]   I don't know, quaint is not the right word, but it's a distinctly different kind of
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   place where everybody walks. I just don't think it would have been
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.520]   the same kind of city, because there are people who are attached to their cars
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   in New York. And so the sprawl in New York, which is enormous, nobody's saying it wasn't,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.880]   spreads over 31 counties, an area about as large as the state of Connecticut,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:18.720]   about as large as the Netherlands, is metropolitan New York. But it's still relatively,
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:24.560]   I don't want to say compact, but everybody knows where the center is.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   It's not that anybody grows up in New York at 16 and thinks that the world is in some mall,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:37.280]   you know, three miles away. They all know there is a center, and that's where it is. It's called
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.920]   Manhattan. And that's New York, and Moses didn't change that for all of his roads.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.480]   There's still in New York a definite center, skyscrapers and everything in the middle.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:57.840]   And it's true, public transit did decline. But you know those, and I like Chicago, by the way,
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:05.280]   and they have a rail transit from O'Hare down to Dan Ryan, not to Dan Ryan, but the
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.600]   JFK Expressway, I think. And it works, sort of, but you got to walk a ways to get on. You got to
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.720]   walk blocks to get in the middle of the expressway and catch the train there. It's not like in New
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.520]   York where you just go down some steps. I mean, New York subway is much bigger than Chicago
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:30.160]   and more widely used and more. And the key thing about New York, and so I think what
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:36.560]   Carol was trying to explain, and your question suggests this, is was Moses
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   responsible for the decline of public transit? Well, he was building cars and roads and bridges.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:50.400]   So in that sense, a little bit, yes. But if you look at New York compared to the rest of the
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:57.440]   United States, it used to be that maybe 20 percent of all the transit riders in the United States
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.160]   were in the New York area. Now it's 40 percent. So if you're looking at the United States,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.960]   what you have to explain is why is New York different from the rest of the United States?
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:13.200]   Why is it that when I was chairman or president of the New York Historical Society, we had rich
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.160]   trustees and I would tell them, well, I got here on a subway. So they would think, I would say,
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.600]   how do you think I got here? Do you know what I mean? I mean, these are people who are close
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.400]   to billionaires and they're saying they use the subway. If you're in lower Manhattan and you're
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   trying to get to Midtown and it's raining, it's five o'clock, you got to be a fool to try to get
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.520]   in your own limousine. It isn't going to get you there very quickly. A subway will. So there are
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:42.480]   reasons for it. And I think Moses didn't destroy public transit. He didn't help it. But his
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   argument was he did. And that's an important distinction, I think. But he was swimming with
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.160]   history. He built what the public wanted. I think if he had built public transit, he would have found
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.920]   it tougher to build. Just for example, Cincinnati built a subway system, a tunnel all through the
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:09.280]   city. It never has opened. They built it. You can still see the holes in the ground where it's
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:16.480]   supposed to come out. By the time they built it, people weren't riding trains anymore. And so it's
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:24.880]   there now. And they don't know what to do with it. And that's 80 years ago. So it's a very
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.560]   complicated. I don't mean to make these issues. They're much more complex than I'm speaking of.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:37.600]   And I just think it's unfair to blame Moses for the problems of the city. I think he did as much
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:45.680]   as anybody to try to bring the city into the 21st century, which he didn't live to. But you've got
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.960]   to adopt. You've got to have a hybrid model in the world now. And I think the model that America
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:59.280]   needs to follow is a model where we reduce our dependence on the cars and somehow ride buses more
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.120]   or use the internet more or whatever it is. But stop using so much fossil fuels so that we destroy
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:12.560]   our environment. And New York, by far, is the most energy efficient place in the United States,
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.880]   mainly because you live in tall buildings. You have hot floors. It doesn't really cost much to
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.280]   heat places because you're heating the floor below you and above you. And you don't have outside
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:30.720]   walls. And you walk. New Yorkers are thinner. Many more people take buses and subways in New York
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.280]   than anywhere else in the United States, not just in absolute terms, in relative terms. So they're
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:46.000]   helping. It's probably a healthier lifestyle to walk around. And I think we're rediscovering it.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.920]   For example, if you come to New York between Thanksgiving and Christmas, there's so many
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.120]   tourists in the city—I'm not making this up—that there is gridlock on the sidewalks.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:06.080]   The police have to direct the traffic. And in part, it's because a Detroit grandmother
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.320]   wants to bring her granddaughter to New York to see what—Hudson's, which is a great department
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:20.160]   store in Detroit, or in any city. It could be Rich's in Atlanta, G Fox in Hartford. Every city
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.640]   had these giant departments. And the windows where the Santa Claus is and stuff like this.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:30.400]   You can still go to New York and see that. You can say, "Jane, this is the way it used to be
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:37.040]   in Detroit." People ringing the bells and looking at the store windows and things like that. A mall
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:44.640]   can't recapture that. It just can't. You try, but it's not the same thing. And so I think that
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:51.600]   in a way, Moses not only did he not destroy New York, I think he gets a little bit of credit for
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.720]   saving it because it might have been on the way to Detroit. Again, I'm not saying that it would
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.240]   have been Detroit because Detroit's almost empty, but Baltimore—it's Cleveland. It's every place.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:08.000]   Then there's nobody there anymore. And even in New York, the department stores have mostly closed,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.960]   not all of them. And so it's not the same as it was 80 years ago, but it's closer to it than
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.720]   anywhere else. Okay. So, yeah. So I'm actually very curious to get your opinion on the following
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.160]   question, given the fact that you are an expert on New York history and you've written the
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.760]   encyclopedia, literally written the encyclopedia on New York City. 800 people wrote the encyclopedia.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:38.400]   I just took all the credit for it. I was the editor-in-chief, so. So I'm actually curious,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.560]   is Caro actually right that—I mean, you talked about the importance just earlier about counterfactual
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:50.240]   history. So I'm curious if Caro is actually right about the claim that the neighborhoods
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:56.480]   through which Moses built his highways were destroyed in a way that neighborhoods which
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   weren't touched by the highways weren't. Sorry for the confusing phrasing there. But basically,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.760]   was there like a—looking back on all these neighborhoods, is there a clear counterfactual
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.840]   negative impact on the neighborhoods in which Moses built his highways and bridges and so on?
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:16.080]   Moses—I mean, Caro makes that argument mostly about East Tremont and places like that in the
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:23.280]   Bronx where the Cross Bronx Expressway passed through. And he says this perfectly wonderful
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.480]   Jewish neighborhood that was not racially prejudiced and everybody was happy and not
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.360]   leaving was destroyed by Moses. Well, first of all, as a historian of New York City, or for that
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.760]   matter, any city, if a student comes to you and says, "That's what I found out," you say, "Well,
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.800]   you know, that runs counter to the experience of every city." So let's do a little more work on
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:48.480]   that. Well, first of all, if you look at the census tracts or the residential security maps of
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.960]   S.H.A., you know it's not true. First of all, the Jews were leaving and had nothing to do with the
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   thing. They didn't love blacks as they did. And also, if you look at other Jewish—and the Bronx
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.680]   was called the Jewish Borough at the time—those neighborhoods that weren't on the Cross Bronx
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.760]   Expressway all emptied out mostly. So the Bronx itself was a part of New York City that followed
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.680]   the pattern of Detroit and Baltimore and Cleveland. Bronx is now coming back, but it's
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:25.120]   a different place. So I think it's—well, I've said this in public and I think it's true—Carroll
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:30.160]   wouldn't know those neighborhoods if he landed there by parachute. You know, they're much better
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:37.040]   than he ever said they were. You know, he acted like if you went outside near the Bronx County
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.880]   Courthouse, you needed a wagon train to go. I mean, I've taken my students there dozens of times
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.320]   and shown them the people, the old ladies eating on the benches and stuff like this. Nobody's
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.760]   mugging them. You know, he just has an outsider's view. He didn't know the places he was writing
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:00.960]   about. But I think Carroll was right about some things. Moses was personally a jerk.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.640]   You can make it stronger than that. But I mean, he was not your friendly grandfather. He was
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:19.600]   arrogant. He was self-centered. He thought he knew the truth and you don't. He was vindictive,
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:32.080]   ruthless. But some of those were good. You know, his strategies in some were good. He made people
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.440]   building a beach or a building feel like you're building a cathedral. You're building something
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.800]   great and I'm going to pay you for it and let's make it good. Let's make it as best as we can.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:48.560]   That itself is a real trick. How do you get people to think of their jobs as more than a
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.440]   job as something else and even a beach or a wall or something like that to say it's good?
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.600]   And he also paid them. So that's important that he does that. And he's making improvements. He
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:08.720]   said he was improving things for the people. I don't know if you want to talk about Jane Jacobs,
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:16.800]   who was a nemesis. And I tend to vote with Jane Jacobs. Jane Jacobs and I agree on a lot of things
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:26.000]   or did before she died a few years ago. But Jane Jacobs saw the city as intricate
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.880]   stores and people living and walking and knowing each other and eyes on the street and all these
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:39.120]   kinds of things. Moses didn't see that at all. He saw the city as a traffic problem. How do we tear
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.080]   this down and build something big and get people the hell out of here? And that was a mistake.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:54.800]   Moses made mistakes. But what Moses was doing was what everybody in the United States was doing,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.880]   just not as big and not as ruthless and not as quick. It was not like Moses built a different
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:06.400]   kind of world that exists in Kansas City. That's exactly what they did in Kansas City or every
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:13.280]   other city. Blow the damn roads to the black neighborhoods, build the expressway interchanges,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.480]   my hometown of Memphis, crisscross with big streets, those neighborhoods gone.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:24.800]   They're even more extensive in places like Memphis and Kansas City and New Orleans than they are in
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:31.360]   New York, because New York builds relatively fewer of them. It's still huge what he built.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:40.320]   But you would not know from the power broker that Los Angeles exists. Actually, Los Angeles
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.760]   was building freeways, too. Or he says that New York got more federal money
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:52.880]   than any other city. Well, not true. I've had students work on Chicago, and Chicago is getting
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   more money per person than New York for some of these projects. So some of the claims,
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:05.200]   no doubt he got those from Moses' own records. But you know, if you're going to write a book
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.160]   like this, you got to know what's going on other places. Anyway, let's go back to your questions.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:16.000]   - No, no. That was one of the things I was actually going to ask you about. So I was glad to
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.720]   get your opinion on that. You know, actually in preparing for this interview and trying to learn
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.920]   more about the impact of these different projects, I was trying to find the economic literature
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:36.400]   on the value of these highways. And so there was a National Bureau of Economic Research paper by
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:43.200]   Morgan Foy, or at least a digest by Morgan Foy, where he says that -- so he's talking about the
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:49.920]   economic gains from highways. And he says, "The gains tend to be largest in areas where roads
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.880]   connect large economic hubs where few alternative routes exist." And he goes on to say, "Two
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:00.480]   segments near New York City have welfare benefits exceeding $500 million a year. Expanding the
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:08.400]   Long Island Expressway had an estimated economic value of $719 million," which I think was Moses.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.920]   And he says, "Of the top 10 segments with the highest rate of return, seven are in New York
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.120]   City area." So it turns out that seven of the top 10 most valuable highway segments in America
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.960]   are in New York. And reading that, it makes me suspect that like there must have -- I mean,
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:33.520]   the way Caro paints Moses' planning process, it's just kind of very impulsive and feelings-based,
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:39.600]   and almost in some cases like out of malice towards poor people. But like given that a
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.240]   century later, it seems that many of the most valuable tracks of highways were planned and
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.280]   built exactly how Moses envisioned, it makes you think that there was some sort of like actual
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.760]   intelligent deliberation and thought that was put into where they were placed.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:01.360]   I think that's true. And I'm not saying that the automobile didn't have an economic impact. That's
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:09.280]   what Moses was building for. He would probably endorse that idea. But I think that what we're
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:17.840]   looking at now in the 21st century is the high value put on places that Moses literally thought
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.520]   were something. He was going to run an expressway from Brooklyn through lower Manhattan to New
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:29.840]   Jersey and knock down all these buildings in Greenwich Village that people love now, love.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:36.320]   I mean, you couldn't -- movie stars, people crowd into those neighborhoods to live, and he saw it
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:46.160]   as a slum. Well, Moses was simply wrong. And Caro puts him to task for that. I think that's true.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:55.600]   Okay. Professor Jackson, now I want to discuss how the process of city planning
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.120]   and building projects has changed since Moses' time. We spent some good amount of time actually
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:07.200]   discussing what it was like, what Moses actually did in his time. But I mean, last year, I believe,
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:13.440]   you wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal talking about how the 27-story building in
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:20.560]   Manhattan was put in limbo because the parking lot, which we replaced, was part of a historic
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:27.440]   district. So, yeah, what is it like to actually build a skyscraper or a highway or a bridge or
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:34.960]   anything of that sort in today's New York City? Well, I do think in the larger context, it's
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:41.600]   probably fair to say it's tougher to build in New York City than any other city. I mean, yeah,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.280]   a little precious suburb, you may not deploy a skyscraper, but I mean, as far as the city's
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:54.880]   concerned, there'll be more opposition in New York than anywhere else. And it's more dense.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.600]   So, just to unload and load stuff to build a building, how do you do that? You know,
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.720]   you got to, trucks have to park on the street. Everything is more complicated and thus more
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:11.120]   expensive. I think a major difference between Robert Moses' time and our own,
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:20.000]   in Robert Moses' time, historic preservation was as yet little known and little understood
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:31.040]   and little supported. And the view generally was building is good, roads are good, houses are good,
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:38.400]   and they're all on the way to a more modern and better world.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:47.360]   We don't have the same kind of faith in the future that they did. We kind of like it like
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:55.040]   it is. Let's just sit on it. So, I think we should say that Moses had an easier time of it
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:02.160]   than he would have had he lived today. It still wasn't an easy time, but easier than today.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.600]   Yeah. Well, actually, can you talk more about what that change in, I guess,
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.080]   philosophy has been since then? I feel like that's been one of the themes of this podcast,
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.440]   to see how our cultural attitude towards progress and technology have changed.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:23.760]   Well, I think one reason why the Power Broker, Robert Carroll's famous book,
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:31.840]   received such popular acclaim is it fits in with book readers' opinions today, which is
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.520]   old is better. I mean, also, you got to think about New York City. If you say it's a pre-war
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:42.320]   apartment, you mean it's a better apartment. You know, everything, you know, the walls are
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:48.720]   solid plaster, not fiberboard and stuff like that. So, old has a reverence in New York that doesn't
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.080]   have in Japan. In Japan, they tear down houses every 15 years. So, it's a whole different thing.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:02.800]   We tend to, in this new country, new culture, we tend to value oldness in some places. And
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.400]   especially in a place that's old, like New York City. I mean, most Americans don't realize that
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:14.240]   New York is not only the most dense American city and the largest, but also really the oldest. I
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.160]   mean, I know there's St. Augustine, but that's taking the concept of what's a city to a pretty
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   extreme things. And then there's Jamestown in Virginia, but there's nobody there. Literally,
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:32.640]   there's nobody there. And then where the pilgrims landed in Massachusetts, Plymouth Plantation,
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:38.720]   that's totally rebuilt as a kind of a theme park. So, for a place that's a city, and Santa Fe a
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:44.320]   little bit in New Mexico, but it was a wide place on the road until after World War II.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.720]   So, the places that would be also, if you like cities, New York is really old.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:55.600]   And it's never valued history, but the historic preservation movement here is very strong.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:03.440]   - What is the reason for its resurgence? Is it just that, 'cause I mean, it's had a big impact
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.480]   on many cities, right? Like, I'm in San Francisco right now, and obviously, you can't tear down one
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:15.200]   of these Victorian houses to build the housing that the city massively needs. Why have we gained
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.000]   a reverence for anything that was built before like 80 years? - I'm surprised because just think
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.880]   of the two most expensive places in the United States. It could change a little bit from year
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.920]   to year, but usually San Francisco and New York. - Right. - And really, if you want to make it more
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:37.760]   affordable, if you want to drop the price of popsicles on your block, sell more popsicles,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:42.800]   have more people selling popsicles and the price will fall. But somehow they say they're going to
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:48.960]   build luxury housing, when actually if you build any housing, it'll put downward pressure on prices,
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.800]   even if it's super luxury. But anyway, most Americans don't understand that. So they oppose
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:00.720]   change, and especially so in New York and San Francisco, on the basis that change means
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.240]   gentrification. And of course, there has been a lot of gentrification. In World War II, or right
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.720]   after, San Francisco was a working class city. It really was. And huge numbers of short and long
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   shoremen lived there. Now, San Francisco has become the headquarters, really, in Silicon Valley, but
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:26.880]   a headquarter city of the tech revolution, and it's become very expensive and very homeless.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:33.680]   It's very complex. Not easy to understand, even if you're in the middle of it. - Yeah, yeah. Okay,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.800]   so if we could get Robert Moses back again today, what major mega project do you think
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:47.760]   New York needs today that a Moses-like figure could build? - Well, if you think really broadly,
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:58.480]   and you take climate change seriously, as I think most people do, probably to build some sort of
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:06.720]   infrastructure to prevent rising water from sinking the city. It's doable. You'd have to,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.840]   like New Orleans, in order to save New Orleans, you had to flood Mississippi and some other places,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:18.880]   so usually there is a downside somewhere. But you could, that would be a huge project,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.280]   to maybe build a bridge, not a bridge, a land bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan,
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   to prevent water coming in from the ocean, because New York is on the ocean.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.760]   And to think of something like that, that's really big. You know,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.360]   some of the other big infrastructure projects, like they're talking about another tunnel
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.840]   under the river, Hudson River, from New Jersey to New York. The problem with that is,
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:48.480]   there are already too many cars in Manhattan. Anything that makes it easier to bring cars
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:54.640]   into Manhattan, because, you know, if you've not been to New York, you don't really understand this,
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.760]   but there's no place for anything. And if you bring more cars in, what are you going to do
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.240]   with them? If you build parking garages for all the cars that could come into the city,
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.760]   then you'd be building over the whole city. There'd be no reason to come here,
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.840]   because it'd all be parking garages or parking lots. So New York City simply won't work
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:20.240]   if you reduce the density or you get rid of underground transportation,
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:27.120]   because it's all about people moving around underneath the streets and not taking up space
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.920]   as they do it. So it won't work. It won't work. And of course, it's not the only city. Tokyo
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:37.120]   wouldn't work either, or lots of cities in the world won't work. Increasingly without
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:42.320]   not just public transportation, but underground public transportation, where you can get it out
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:49.760]   of the way of traffic and stuff like that. Moses probably could have done that. He wouldn't have
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.560]   loved it as much as he loved bridges, because he wanted you to see what he built. And there was an
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.960]   argument in the power broker, but he didn't really want the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel built, because he
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:07.680]   wanted to build a bridge that everybody could see. So he may not have done it with such enthusiasm.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.520]   I actually believe that Moses was first and foremost a builder. He really wanted to build
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:19.040]   things, change things. If you said, "We'll pay you to build tunnels," I think he would have built
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:25.360]   tunnels. Who knows? He never was offered that. That wasn't the time in which he lived.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:33.200]   Yeah, okay. And then I'm curious if you think that today, to get rid of, I guess, the red tape and
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:39.600]   the NIMBYism, would it just be enough for one man to accumulate as much influence as Moses had,
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.080]   and then to push through some things? Or does that need to be some sort of systemic reform?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.080]   Because when Moses took power, of course, there was also that Tammany Hall machine that he had
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:53.600]   to run through, right? Is that just what's needed today to get through the bureaucracy? Or is
[00:59:53.600 --> 01:00:03.040]   something more needed? Well, I don't think Robert Moses, with all of his talents and personality,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.800]   I don't think he could do in the 21st century what he did in the middle of the 20th century.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.320]   I think he would have done a lot, maybe more than anybody else. But also, I think his methods,
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:22.400]   his really bullying messages, really, really, he bullied people, including powerful people.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.680]   I don't think that would work quite as easily today. But I do think we need it today.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:34.400]   And I think even today, you know, we found even now we have in New York, just the beginnings
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:42.720]   of leftists. I'm thinking of AOC, the woman who led the campaign against Amazon in New York,
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.440]   saying, well, we need some development. If we want to make housing more affordable,
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.120]   somebody's got to build something. It's not going to become more affordable because you say you want
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.600]   affordable housing. You've got to build affordable housing, and especially you've got to build more
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:02.880]   of it. So we have to allow people, we have to overrun the, overturn the nimbyism to say, well,
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:10.320]   even today, for all of our concern about environmental change, we have to work
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   together. I mean, in some ways, we have to quote, we have to believe that we're,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.200]   in some ways, in the same boat. And it won't work if we put more people in the boat, but don't make
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.920]   the boat any bigger. And yeah, but when people discuss Moses, and the power accumulated, they
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.560]   often talk about the fact that he took so much power from democratically elected officials,
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.120]   and he centralized so much power in himself. And, you know, obviously, the power broker talks a
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.560]   great deal about the harms of that kind of centralization. But I'm curious, having studied
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.400]   the history of New York, what are the benefits if there can be one coordinated cohesive plan for the
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.320]   entire city? So if there's one person who's designing all the bridges, all the highways,
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.520]   all the parks, is something more made possible that can be possible if like multiple different
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.600]   branches and people have their own unique visions? I don't know if that question makes sense, but
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:09.200]   that's a big question. And you've got to put a lot of trust into the grand plan, or especially
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.480]   if a massive area of 20, 25 million people, bigger than the city, I'm not sure what you're
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:23.360]   really talking about. Now, I think that in some ways, we've gone too far in the ability to obstruct
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:34.320]   change, to stop it. And we need change. I mean, houses deteriorate, and roads deteriorate,
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.720]   and sewers deteriorate. We have to build into our system the ability to improve them.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:48.880]   Now in New York, we respond to emergencies. All of a sudden, a water main breaks, the street
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:55.760]   collapses, and then they stop everything, stop the water main break and repair the street and
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.400]   whatever it is. Meanwhile, in a hundred other places, it's leaking. It's just not leaking
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.520]   enough to make the road collapse. But the problem is there every day, every minute.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.640]   Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm curious, as a professor, you've studied American history.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.680]   Do you just see this as a cyclical thing, where you have periods where maybe one person has too
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.440]   much power, to periods where there's dispersed butocracy and sclerosis, and then you're just
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.840]   going to go through these cycles? Or how do you see that in the grand context of things? How do
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.560]   you see where we are, where we were during Moses, and where we might be in the future?
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.360]   Well, you're right to say that much of life is cyclical, and there is a swing back and forth.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:50.320]   But having said that, I think the person like Robert Moses is unusual, partly because he might
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:57.680]   have gone on to become a hedge fund person, or they didn't have hedge funds when he was around,
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.560]   but you know, new competitor to Goldman Sachs. I mean, he could have done a lot of things,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.440]   maybe been a general. He wanted to have power and control. And I think that's harder to accumulate
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:17.840]   now. We have too much power. You can demonstrate and you can stop anything. We love demonstrations
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.160]   in the United States. We respect them. We see it as a visible expression of our democracy,
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:32.640]   is your ability to get on the streets and block the streets. But still, you have to get to work.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:39.120]   I mean, at some point in the day, you got to do something. And yeah, Hitler could have done a lot
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.160]   of things if he wanted to. You know, he could have made Berlin into, but you know, if you have all
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:50.960]   the power, Hitler had a lot of it. If he turned Berlin into a colossal city, he was going to make
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:58.320]   it like Washington, but perhaps five. Washington has already got its own issues. You know, the
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.720]   buildings are too big. Government buildings don't have eyes, don't have life on the streets and
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.000]   stuff like this. Somebody like Hitler would destroy it forever, you know, because you build
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.160]   a monumental city that's not for people. And I think that was probably one of Moses's weak points
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:26.000]   is unlike a Jane Jacobs who saw people. Moses didn't see people. He saw bridges. He saw highways.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.680]   He saw tunnels. He saw rivers. He saw the city is a giant traffic problem.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:42.960]   Jane Jacobs, who was a person without portfolio most of her life, except of her own powers of
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:50.560]   judgment and persuasion. She thought, well, how does this, what is the shoe repair man
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:55.360]   got to do with the grocery store, got to do with the school, got to do with something else.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:04.160]   She saw what Moses didn't see. She saw the intricacies of the city. He saw a giant landscape.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.080]   She saw the block, just the block. Yeah. There's a, there's like a common trope
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.120]   about socialist and communist, which is that they, that they love humanity and the abstract,
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.480]   but they hate people as individuals. And it's like, I guess one way to like describe Robert Moses,
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.080]   but it actually kind of reminds me of one of my, one, one of my relatives is a doctor
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.440]   and he's he's not exactly a people person. And he says like, you know, I hate like actually having
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.840]   to talk to the patients about like, and you know, like ask them questions. I just like the actual
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.640]   detective work of like what is going on and looking at the charts and figuring out doing
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:46.800]   the diagnosis. Are you optimistic about New York? Do you think that in the continuing towards the
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.880]   end of the 21st century and into the 22nd century, it will still be the capital of the world or what
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.400]   do you think is the future of the city? Well, The Economist, which is a major publication
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:05.600]   that comes out of England, recently predicted that London and New York would be in 2100,
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.280]   what they are today, which is the capitals of the world. And London is not,
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.720]   is not really a major city in terms of population is probably under 10 million,
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.840]   much smaller than New York and way smaller than Tokyo. But London has a cosmopolitan heterogeneous
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:30.480]   atmosphere within the rule of law, what London and New York both offer, which Shanghai doesn't
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.680]   or Hong Kong doesn't at the moment is a system. So if you disagree, you're not going to disappear.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:45.360]   You know what I mean? It's like, there's some level of guarantee that personal safety is
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.960]   sacred and you can say what you want. I think that's valuable. It's very valuable. And I think
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.200]   the fact that it's open to newcomers, you can't, you can't find a minority, so minority
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.080]   that they don't have a presence in New York and a physical presence. I mean,
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:08.960]   if you're from Estonia, which has got fewer people than New York suburbs, I mean individual New York
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.320]   suburbs, but there's an Estonian house, there's Estonian restaurants, there's, you know, India,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:22.080]   Pakistan, every place has got an ethnic presence. And if you want it, you can have it. You want to
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.920]   merge with the larger community, merge with it. That's fine. But if you want to celebrate your
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:33.440]   special circumstances, it's been said that New York is everybody's second home.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.000]   Because you know, if you come to New York, you can find people just like yourself
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.560]   and speaking your language and eating your food and going to your religious institution.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.080]   I think that's going to continue. And I think it what makes, not only what makes the United
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.680]   States unusual, there are a few other places like it. Switzerland is like it. But the thing
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.760]   about Switzerland that's different from the United States is there are parts of Switzerland,
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.480]   most of it's Swiss German and parts of it's French, but they stay in their one places,
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.680]   you know what I mean? So they speak French here and they speak German there.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.720]   You know, Arizona and Maine are not that different demographically in the United States.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:20.240]   Everybody has shuffled the deck several times. And so I think that's what, and that's what makes
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:26.400]   New York unique. And London too. Paris a little bit. You go to the Paris underground, you don't
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.440]   even know what language you're listening to. I think to be a great city in the 21st century.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.560]   And by the way, that often the Texas cities are very diverse. San Francisco, LA, very diverse.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.680]   It's not just New York. New York kind of stands out because it's bigger in because
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.840]   the neighborhoods are more distinct. Anybody can see them. I think that's, and that's what
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.680]   Robert Moses didn't spend any time thinking about. He wasn't concerned with who was eating at that
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:02.800]   restaurant. Wasn't important. Or even if there was a restaurant, you know, whereas now the move,
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.640]   the slow drift back towards cities. And I'm predicting that the pandemic will not have a
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:15.040]   permanent influence. I mean, the pandemic is huge and it's affected the way people work and live and
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.640]   shop and have recreation. So I'm not trying to blow it off like something else. But I think in
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:28.960]   the long run, we are social animals. We want to be with each other. We need each other, especially
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.080]   if you're young and you want to be potential romantic partners. But even other people are
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:42.960]   drawn. Like just a few days ago, there was a horrible tragedy in Seoul, Korea. That's because
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.800]   a hundred thousand young people are drawn to each other. They could have had more room to
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:55.040]   swing their arms, but they wanted to crowd into this one alley because that's where other people
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:02.000]   were. They wanted to go where other people were. And that's a lot about the appeal of cities today.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.640]   We've, we've been in cars and we've been on interstate highways. And at the end of the day,
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.000]   we're, we're, we're almost like cats. We want to get together at night and sleep on each other
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.280]   or with each other. And I think that's the ultimate, it's not for everybody. Most people
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.320]   had maybe rather live in a small town or on the top of a mountain, but there's a percentage of
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:32.160]   people, let's call it 25% who really want to be part of the tumble in the tide and want to be
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.520]   things mixed up. And they will always want to be in a place like New York. There are other places,
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.920]   San Francisco, Boston, you know, Philadelphia, a little bit. They're not mainly in the United
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.120]   States, but in Europe, Copenhagen, you know, they're not, Copenhagen is not a big city,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.880]   neither is Prague, but they have urbanity. New York has urbanity. And I think we don't celebrate
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.680]   urbanity as much as we might. The pure joy of being with others.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.760]   - Yep. Yep. By the way, I'm curious if you ever got a chance to
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.720]   talk to Robert Caro himself about Moses at some point.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:15.280]   - Robert Caro and I, we're friends. In fact, when the power broker received an award,
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.440]   the Francis Parkman Prize from the Society of American Historians,
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.720]   we turned out we lived near each other in the Bronx and I drove him home and we became friends
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:35.200]   and social friends. And I happened to be with him on the day that Robert Moses died. We were
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:42.000]   with our wives eating out in a neighborhood called Arthur Avenue, the real Little Italy of New York,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:52.400]   it's in the Bronx. It's also called Belmont. But then on the 100th anniversary of Moses' birth,
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:13:00.080]   I think in 1989, I was asked to give the keynote speech at a conference at Hofstra University on
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:07.440]   Moses. And Caro was also invited to be a speaker, maybe another keynote speaker. And there I said,
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.240]   and I still stand by this, that the power broker, I learned more from it than any book I ever read
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:21.280]   because it's such an enormous topic. I learned more from it and I wish I had written it myself
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.480]   so that my name was on it rather than his. And I think it was the best book I ever read.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.000]   That may be a slight exaggeration, but just like, it's an incredible achievement.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:39.280]   But having said that, I said, it's got a thousand errors, you know, just small errors. I mean,
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:45.840]   in broad strokes, it's correct. Robert Moses had more power than any urban figure in American
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:54.320]   history. He built incredible monuments that the city needs. He was ruthless and arrogant and
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.440]   honest. That's a big story right there. That's probably true. But in all the little stories
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.480]   about the temperature in the swimming pools, about the destruction of public transit, about the
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:12.800]   destruction of the Bronx with the Cross-Bronx Expressway, about the building the bridges too
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:19.280]   low so that buses couldn't get to the beaches. He's just wrong. I mean, it's just in that way.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.160]   Wasn't that way? Isn't that way? And all he had to do was look at some different sources. You know
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.680]   that they were doing some of the same things in LA or Chicago. They just weren't as famous as New
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:38.800]   York. I mean, that's more or less what it was. But I think, I still feel that way. I still wish
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.880]   I had written the book. I wish my name was on it. Even with all those mistakes, I've had taught for
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:51.200]   a half a century and more of New York City history at Columbia University. I've had dozens of students
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.240]   write term papers on one or another aspect of Carroll's book. I can never remember a single
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.080]   one coming back and saying, "Oh, Carroll got it right." You know, they would go back to the same
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.920]   source and stuff like this. You know, this is not what, this is not the way he said it was.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.600]   Now they may be smaller, but it was generally that way. They didn't celebrate it. I think he'd made
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.520]   up his mind what he was going to argue before he started it. And Moses was a jerk. For example, he
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:27.120]   think of the issues now with President Biden and his son Hunter, you know, and all the grief he's
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:37.680]   catching about his son or people with, you know, having a hiring. My wife is telling me not to go
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:46.720]   down this road. But, but, but Moses is attacked in the book because he's not good enough to his
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.720]   brother. You know, he should have done more for his brother than he did. Well, you know, so he,
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:01.360]   he didn't give his brother a job. And so I'm just saying that all these little things that you can
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:08.480]   come to about different neighborhoods and things like that. But then I think
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.600]   Carroll was right that Moses, the biggest builder of cities in the 20th century,
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.280]   the builder of the greatest city in the world, didn't like it. That's incredible. He didn't
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.480]   actually like the place he was designing. He wanted everybody to get out to go. It's a better,
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.320]   it's better in the suburbs, better if you have a house, but if you have a garage, but if you
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.760]   have a car at the front, that's better than the Bronx or Brooklyn or Queens. You know what I mean?
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:43.040]   Whereas again, his opponent, Jane Jacobs or people now, and one of the greatest changes now than when
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:49.520]   Moses, when Carroll was writing Moses is people wanted to all have a car in New York. Everybody
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.960]   have a car. Teenagers when they were 16 years old, they wanted to have a driver's license more than
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:01.920]   they wanted to have sex. Get me the car. Now, a big percentage of young Americans are skipping
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   the driver's license. They don't care as much. We're moving into a different time and where
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.600]   that's going to lead us. I'm not sure, but I think we're ready to walk more for health reasons,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:19.040]   all sorts of reasons. But Moses did not see it. Moses never drove, but he created the world for
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:26.400]   drivers. - Yeah. So some people might object to this defense of Moses by saying like, listen,
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:32.880]   whenever he does something well, we give him credit here. But then whenever he does something
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   badly, we just say, oh, well, he was just swimming with the tide of history. There were other cities
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.160]   that were doing it worse. So we're doing, you know, we're like doing whataboutism on the negative
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.240]   side of Moses' legacy, but then we're like happy to let him take credit for the good things.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:53.120]   It's kind of a double standard. How would you respond to that? - Well, I understand what you're
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.560]   saying and I can sympathize with it, but I think most of the things, let's take the cross Bronx
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:06.400]   expressway as an egregious example of something that Robert Caro or Moses' critics would say,
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.720]   God, all these people, tens of thousands of people paid a price. Their lives were uprooted.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   But I just can't imagine you would say we can't have a cross Bronx. I mean, you know,
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.160]   it could have been two blocks this way or two blocks that way. That's a different question.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.720]   And we can talk about that too. But I think we have to have it. And I think the parks,
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:35.440]   I think the bridges, the Verrazano-Neiros bridge transforms Staten Island. The history of Staten
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:41.200]   Island is before and after 1964, they had to take into account the curvature of the earth.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.960]   That bridge was so long at the time, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. It's been
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:54.080]   surpassed in Europe since then, but a big bridge, that would be, that would be a lifetime's
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:00.320]   achievement. If you built a Verrazano-Neiros bridge, this gigantic, gorgeous entrance to
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:06.640]   New York Harbor, that's, that's a lifetime achievement. For Moses, it's one of a list of
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.920]   about 50 things. You know, you don't even think about the Verrazano-Neiros bridge and Robert
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.040]   Moses. It's just not, yeah, he did it. So what? He did lots of other big things too.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:25.680]   I think it's the scale and the scale was not human. It was totally on a different scale.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.000]   And with that comes a lot of criticism because as he would say himself, in order to make an
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:39.360]   omelet, you have to break eggs. No other way to do it. And he would say, I have, I had to make,
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.760]   I had to do it. So this is his answer. In order to build a great public
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:52.240]   event or thing, I have to hurt some people. That's just the way it is. And I think,
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.800]   and we don't want to, the way we live now, we don't want to hurt anybody.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:04.080]   You can't, you can't run a city or a country that way. You can't, nothing will change.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:13.040]   Yeah. I've, I've had recently a lot of guests who have been advocating for this philosophical
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.160]   view that's called long-termism, which is basically the idea that we should take the
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.920]   interest of future generations and consider them equally with the interest of people alive today,
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.920]   as a way to like emphasize, for example, that, you know, people who live like thousands of
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:33.200]   years from now, we should take their interest seriously. And one of the, I guess if we take
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.800]   this kind of view that basically we just care about progeny more, you know, it's interesting.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.200]   There's a part of the power broker where they're talking about the, you know, the cross Bronx
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:50.000]   expressway through East Tremont and Moses is getting opposition from some elected official.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   And Moses responds by saying, you know, you, you make a habit out of pointing out that I'm
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.680]   not democratically elected while you are. But the advantage of me not being democratically elected
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.560]   is that I can build projects that might not be the favorite thing for the people alive now,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.240]   but will benefit the city for generations and centuries to come.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.880]   There's obviously like a lot of arrogance there. And it's like, well, if that's true, right. But
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.720]   to the extent that that is true, and it is in many cases, right? Like all these bridges
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.840]   you're talking about and all these highways, they're, they're still standing today and in
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:26.240]   wide use. It, you know, it kind of changes how you think about him, like given all the,
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.720]   given all the omelet breaking that, or the egg breaking that had to happen at the time,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.000]   it's still the fact that like, we can, we can, for hundreds of years, we'll get to use the things he
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.400]   built. Right. So yeah. I'm curious, how did, how did Carol, so you mentioned you were,
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.080]   you were with him when you found out that Moses had died, how did you react?
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.080]   Was he sad about it or? Well, he was being interviewed. I just remember being stunned
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.360]   at the restaurant. We were eating in a restaurant in the Bronx and they brought a telephone to him.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.280]   I'd never seen anybody have a telephone brought to them. Yeah. That was way before cell phones
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.560]   and everything else. It was 1989 or something like that. I don't remember the exact year,
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:14.320]   but it was somewhere like that. But we were, we were, we were, we were friends when that,
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.240]   when he died, maybe it was 1981. Anyway, whatever year it was. It was after he,
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.360]   I criticized him in public and the New York times quoted me, but they didn't quote that.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   I thought it was the best book I'd ever read. I wish I'd written it. They did quote that. I said,
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.040]   it was full of mistakes. That's what the New York Times, that's what he read. He didn't hear my
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.840]   speech. And so, but I'm, I'm sorry. I'm not done that. Don't have enemies with anyone, but
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:46.080]   I have regard for the book and have regard from his ability to do research. That's what's amazing
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:52.160]   about the power broker is his ability and interest in going back and interviewing his third grade
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.480]   teacher, you know, and stuff like that and finding that out. That's way more than most
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.360]   of us are willing to do. But what was his reaction when he found out that Moses died?
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:08.720]   You know, that was, that was not unexpected. He was 90 years old at the time. And remember,
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:14.800]   this is 30 years ago, more than that. Not many people lived to be 90. And he was a,
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:22.000]   well, he swam. He was an athlete. He was a swimmer, swam in the ocean in his eighties.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:30.400]   He was quite a person. Yeah. Yeah. There was, there's a part in the, in Karo's memoir
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:37.040]   where he talks about learning from his, from, you know, Moses, former aides, who are now friends
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.680]   with Karo, how they would tell him that now that he had lost his power, he was just in his in his,
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.200]   you know, in his house all day, just like looking at all his plans and writing down more ideas for
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.800]   there should be another highway here and so on. And, you know, just kind of like impotently making
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.960]   new, you know, new ideas and so on. And Karo says that just like that, hearing about that scene,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.600]   this master builder, just kind of just having nothing to do really, it made him want to cry.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.840]   And he, despite the fact that he was, he documented all the harm that Moses had done.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.400]   That was like a really interesting, really interesting.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.560]   Well, Moses had a phenomenal amount of power and he loses it all in the short order.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:27.680]   And that's gotta be tough, really tough. Now, Moses did write a response to the Power Broker,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:37.520]   which was published in the New Yorker about 1975, which is a long response,
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.040]   saying, of course, that Karo had it all wrong and didn't know that your listeners might want to go
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:50.720]   to. It's available, I'm sure, in the New Yorker. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I thought, I don't know
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.840]   what your reaction to the response was. I read it and I thought that Moses, at least,
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:03.280]   I thought that Moses kind of vindicated Karo's description of his personality because it was
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:09.200]   very ad hominem. It wasn't specific. I'm sure there were a lot of errors, as you say, but then
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.760]   Moses just says, I mean, he wrote 8,000 words, but he like actually documents very few of the
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.840]   supposed errors that he claims Karo's making. And the ones he does document are like minor ones,
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.600]   not the major ones that had to like, that were about his major public works. So it's just like
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.840]   small little details. But yeah, I don't know what your reaction was to that response.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.720]   Well, I think you're very perceptive. I think his response was rambling,
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:42.640]   wordy, not particular. I think he probably could have taken Karo apart, but he didn't. He didn't
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:49.280]   say this page, so-and-so, you said this, you know, this is wrong. He didn't. And he also,
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   Moses didn't have people around him, like maybe Hitler didn't or Trump or somebody else to say,
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.640]   boss, you're wrong here. You got to reword this. You don't mean it the way you said it.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:09.360]   And also the quality of her response was poor enough that he needed assistance. He needed a
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:16.640]   smart or three or four smart people to say, put it this way. You got to give it, go give this example
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:23.600]   or do something else. But still, it tells you something about Moses, the response and also the
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:33.280]   way Moses kind of held grudges. And so he blames the New Yorker and he blames Knopf, Alfred Knopf
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.440]   Publishers, because you're in cahoots with Karo, so you're all damned and going to hell rather than
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:45.840]   just talking about Karo. So maybe that's just the way he looked at the world at his time. You know,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.000]   you got to find out who's got the levers of power and then go after them. The rest of the people
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.600]   don't matter. Yeah. Yep. Okay. So I want to be respectful of your time. You've given me so much
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:02.240]   already. But before we close out the interview, if you have any other things you want to say about
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.440]   the power broker or about Moses or about his legacy or about, I don't know, NIMBYism today or
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:14.160]   the state of construction and public works today? Well, I think of, I think of Moses as the,
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.680]   the polar opposite of Jane Jacobs. Jane Jacobs was a woman, but think about what
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:28.320]   Jane Jacobs saw as important. She saw the block, the store, the people, the mixture of
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:35.600]   genders and races and everything else as being significant. Robert Moses really didn't see,
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.000]   as you said earlier, people. He saw, he saw massive things, you know, things you put on
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.520]   an architectural board, you know, and, and he didn't see other things. So that's both his strength
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:53.040]   and his weakness. Had he seen people more, maybe he would never have built what he did. And we
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:00.320]   wouldn't have had the bridges, you know, but we, we do. And can you imagine New York without the
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.240]   Trailborough Bridge? I mean, it's not imaginable, you know, you, you gotta have it because what,
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:13.760]   again, readers who have not been to New York may not understand this is a city that has water all
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.040]   through it. You know, it's about water. It's not like Dallas where there's essentially no water.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.520]   You know what I mean? New York water's everywhere. You've got to cross these bridges. You've got to,
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.680]   you've got to get over that. So it creates a problem of circulation that's vast, especially
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:36.160]   when you have tens of millions of people trying to move around. So that's something that Moses
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:43.280]   figured a way around. Yep. Yep. Oh, actually, one more question that just occurs to me is just that
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:50.480]   I'm curious why you think that this biography of Moses by Carol achieved the cultural prominence
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.400]   it did. Of course, it's like an incredible book. And I like I incredibly, I enjoyed it a lot as
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.320]   well. But like, there's countless biographies written every year, right? And many of them
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.960]   are also good. What was it about this book that catapulted it? I mean, there was a review of the
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.080]   new play about Robert Moses. And the title of that review was just that New Yorkers love to hate
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:18.400]   Robert Moses. Why does he have this sort of cultural prominence in New York and actually
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:26.640]   across the world? Well, because I think Robert Moses represented a past that's, you know, a time
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.520]   when we wanted to build bridges and super highways and things that pretty much is going on. We're not
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.400]   building super highways now. We're not building vast bridges like Moses built all the time.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:42.960]   So it's, we're, he's not swimming with the tide of history anymore. And so I think that's part of it.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.400]   Plus the fact that it's a, it's a biography that has a, has an argument and the argument's
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.520]   understandable and it runs through the whole book. And he's in a, he's a terrific writer
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:30:00.400]   and builds suspense and he can write a paragraph in two words and he repeats himself a little too
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:08.960]   much. And anyway, when I get negative, my wife is nearby getting on me. Anyway, I think it's
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:16.560]   a terrific book. Look, Moses was a great man. Carol is a, is a great writer and in many ways,
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:22.000]   a great historian. And I think the other thing is Carol's book is so important. You know,
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.120]   Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, I have lots of books written about him.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:33.200]   Carol, not so much. I mean, Moses, not so much. He's not that famous. So it was, it's such a big
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.880]   and intimidating book. Everybody else is afraid to go there. There will be other books about Robert
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:46.400]   Moses. There may be underway as we speak and they will revise our reinterpretation. I think that's
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.840]   true. He will be reinterpreted in ways in which we talked about today, though I don't know that.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:31:00.560]   But you know, the basic, the basic thing that Moses did is, was there. You can look at it.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:09.200]   And the things that Carol said about him are mostly true. I mean, where he lived is, you know,
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:16.880]   gives a little tiny bit about an affair that he once explained to me that sex was not important
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:23.360]   to Moses. You know, that you want to understand him. It wasn't about, it wasn't about females.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:31.440]   And I think that he cared about what Moses was committed, married to his job and to his vision
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.960]   of a city. And that's both his greatness and the fact that he didn't have friends or many friends
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:41.120]   and he didn't live the world the way most people live it, you know, with
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:48.960]   people. I think that's probably all I know. Well, this is a true pleasure. I highly recommend
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:56.640]   that people check out your book, Robert Moses and the Modern City, the Transformation of New York.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.760]   And there they can find your essay on, you know, Robert Moses and the Rise of New York City,
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.840]   which I highly recommend. Professor Jackson, where else can people find you?
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:13.600]   My email address is still at Columbia university. KTJ is my initials one, number one@columbia.edu.
