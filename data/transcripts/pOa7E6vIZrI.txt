[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound where our audience is getting smarter.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It's kind of like the alien in the movie, you know, where it's like evolving over time and getting smarter.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   They know how to ask questions to pull my little heartstrings. They know which questions
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I'm going to answer. So we got some today that I swear we're just, it's like
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   the Ben AI chat bot. Like we know what Ben's going to pick here.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   If you start off with love you guys, you've immediately got my attention, you know.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So we have a dock full of, I don't know, a hundred questions still we haven't gotten to. We try to get to them all.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But we get new ones every week and then we have the old ones and some of them just
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   we got some good ones this week. So askthecompoundshow@gmail.com
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   if you want to email us. This morning in my email inbox
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I got a January financial report from Rocket Money, who's the sponsor of the show today.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So how much I spent last month, the percentage change
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   from what I normally spend, the largest transaction, which I think was
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   plane tickets maybe, and the percentage of income that I spent, right. Here's your income,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   how much you brought in, here's how much you spent as a percentage. It also shows the biggest category changes
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   in spending. So travel, shopping, eating out, etc. Was it higher or
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   lower from the month before? Pretty cool. So Rocket Money is the personal finance
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   app that lets you find and cancel your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending, helps you lower your

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Duncan, everyone wanted to know why you're not wearing a suit today.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Duncan and I were at the New York Stock Exchange the other day, and he put me to shame because he wore a suit
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and tie. I walk into the office, I'm wearing a sweater and a nice, you know,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I don't wear a tie anymore. I gave up on it in COVID. I just decided ties are,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I think I threw them all away. You looked very fashionable. I had a sport coat
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   on, but you put me to shame because people thought you worked on Wall Street. No hat,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   hair slicked back. Very nice. Thanks. My
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   hair was probably not very dressy. My
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   wardrobe is binary. I have flannels, and then I have a suit.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I don't really have many in-betweens. It's either I'm dressed up
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   or I'm not dressed up. It's like my portfolio. It's a barbell. It is funny, though. Someone on the train
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   started talking to me the whole way back about equity swaps. For real.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I've worked to the part, I guess, you know.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   All right. Questions?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   First, before we dive into that, I was going to say a little cross-promotion. Everyone should check out
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Ben's blog, Wealth of Common Sense. I love this thing you wrote,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   "17 Thoughts About Money." I just wanted to share a couple of them. That's all really good.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The second one, you have, "Money can't buy happiness," is something only rich
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   people say. So true. People with money say that. Right, exactly.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   People always say that. What they mean is money is not going to be the thing
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   that makes you happy. It's not going to fill a hole. Right, and that's true.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Only wealthy people say that. It's going to make your life a lot easier, though. Right.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   No one's happy when they're worried about how they're going to pay their next bill or that kind of thing.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   The other one I really liked was, "True money contentment comes from
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   accepting people dumber than you will be richer than you."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You just have to get over that. Sometimes people are going to make a bunch of money on some cryptocurrency
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   that you missed, and you just have to be okay with that. Circumstances, luck, whatever it is,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   you can't let that grate at you. It's like the thing, someone's always
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   going to be smarter than you. I always say that about investing. It's like the opposite with money.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's someone dumber than you. You're like, "How is that person so much richer than me?" Guess what? You just have to live with it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It happens. Yeah, it's life. I also like number eight, "Most problems that can be
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   solved using money aren't real problems," and you go on to say how it's nothing
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   compared to a health scare or things like that. That's stuff that really put it into perspective.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Yeah, and then last but not least, I really loved the
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   number 16, "People who act like they have it all figured out are usually full of shit."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's true. Yeah, most people would agree with that. Good list.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Because the truth is, no one has it figured out. I don't care how well-versed
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   you are or how smart you are, no one has it all figured out. Very true.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Good post, though. I like that. Appreciate it. Alright, let's do a question.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Alright, up first today we have a question from David.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   "We wanted to start investing in a college account for our new granddaughter with regular deposits.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Is 60/40 the best approach for a college account? That's what we would do on
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Reflex, but wanted to get your thoughts. Sounds simple, but if that's the answer,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   what's in the 60 and what's in the 40? And should it be passive or actively managed
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   in some way, like simple rebalancing annually?" This actually
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   raised a question I was going to follow up with you on. Is it considered active if you just rebalance annually?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   No, that's part of your allocation. I mean, whatever.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Every decision is active if you want to really split hairs here. But I love where David's head is at here.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'm not going to lie. I gave some not-so-subtle hints to my parents and the in-laws
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   that hint, hint, wink, wink. You don't have to buy toys
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   all the time. We can also do 529 contributions. That was made clear.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's very easy, actually. The Michigan 529 plan makes it easy for someone to gift
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   a 529 contribution. Obviously,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I have three kids. Putting them through college is not going to be cheap. Plus, we have twins who will be attending at the same time.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I think my oldest daughter will be a senior when the twins are freshmen. So, we'll have three
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   kids in college at the same time. And the grandparents have come through. Our provider
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   at Michigan, they have a bunch of
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   different investment options. Now, you can pick those investment options yourself, which is easy. Some people
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   just pick a simple total stock market index. Ours is mostly index funds. A lot of it depends
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   on what state you're from. So, I would first check with your own children to see if they have a 529
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   plan set up in the first place. Maybe they've already made elections for investment options.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   But if not, we all know I'm a big target date
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   fund guy. We practice what we preach here in the compound. I invest in index funds
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and target date funds. Duncan invests in stocks that fall 98%.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Sometimes.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Sometimes go up, too. Sometimes go up, too. That's true. Depends when you start.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So, the Michigan 529 plan has these investment options that are based on
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   the year the child will be starting school. And it's just a target date fund.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I looked at the Michigan options, and they range from
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   20 to like 2080. And I looked at the one for my daughter.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   She's going to be 10 this year, which is mind-boggling. This is something all parents have to say.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Like, I can't believe how quickly the time went. It's also true.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I think hers is 60/40. And it's a mix of U.S. stocks, international
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   stocks, REITs, TIPS, total bond market fund, and
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   corporate bonds. So, it's pretty well diversified. It rebalances automatically. And it also has the glide path
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   where it slowly gets more conservative as you get closer
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   to the age. So, I like that option. It just does it for me.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So, it's an active thing, but it's got the glide path. You could always make it
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   more risky if you wanted to go further out. Like, pick a year that's further away. More conservative
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   if you want to pick a year that's closer. But that's the thing for me that would be easiest. You don't have to get in there and tinker.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Especially if it's going to be for your granddaughter. You want to be like, try to actively manage this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   That way, you know when they're there. She's at college
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   age. It's going to be relatively conservative, so the money's there to be spent. So, I like that option.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But yeah, talk to your kids first. It's not the perfect option, of course.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   You could say, well, there's ways to do better. But the beauty of it is it's automated.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's simple. It's well diversified. Michigan probably has a top quartile 529
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   plan. So, I would check which state you're in, or your granddaughter's in, to make
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   sure they have similar offerings. But that's what I do. And I think it's
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   easy. That's a big part of it to me. I didn't realize if I changed
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   state by state. Yeah, depending on the state. Which kind of stinks.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They should have the same all over. But Morningstar does these rankings where they
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   do gold, silver, bronze, I don't know, coal for the
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   worst ones. But Michigan's probably, yeah. It's like
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   a silver, so it's pretty good. But some states are better than others.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Not really a thing where it pays off for the risk of picking a bunch
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   of risky stocks. Yeah, I don't think you want to go out on a limb.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   But this sort of thing, as far as your grandchildren are concerned,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that's a great gift. That's the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Yeah, though you can't roll it around on the ground like a cool car or something.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   When they're walking down the aisle some day with their tassel
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and gown on, they'll be thankful. When those student loans aren't as big.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Alright, next question. Alright, up next we have
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I like this question. This is a cool question. This is the one.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   This person put this question in specifically for me. Yeah, right.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   They know their audience.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I love the question because it hits on so many. I was born for this question, basically.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Expensive trucks, compound interest, young people making terrible financial decisions.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And I love the way that Jim put it here. The sequence of spending risk.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I don't want to spend shame people and say, "You shouldn't buy this $70,000 truck."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   If you can afford it, fine. But especially when you're young, that makes a huge, huge difference.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Especially if you're not saving that much. So I've written a number of posts
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   over the years about excessive spending on trucks and SUVs. So I asked if a Ford F150
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   is partially responsible for the retirement crisis. I think I wrote a piece called
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   For people new here, Ben hates big vehicles and expensive vehicles.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So an expensive truck is just like, you know, that's the worst.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I don't hate them. I just hate them for certain people.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Alright? Again, I'm not a fan of spend shaming unless
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   you're spending way too much and you're not saving any money.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And if you take up too many parking spots. Listen, the two biggest fixed expenses you have
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   are housing costs and transportation for most people. Right?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's not the lattes. It's not the brown bag lunches. It's not
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Netflix streaming services. It's the big expenses. And if you lock yourself into
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   a four-figure car payment for a truck because you want to be cool and it makes you feel better,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I can't get on board with that. Okay. So I poked around a little bit
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and I found new car loan rates at like 6%. Probably 6-7 depending on your
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   FICO score. Financing a $70,000 truck. No down payment
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   over 5 years at 6%. That's a monthly payment of $1,350.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's an obscene amount of money for young people. I love the
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   way that they frame this because they say young people, right? This is a person who's a little wiser,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   understands saving. They know that that's a ridiculously high monthly payment, especially
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   for a young person because of the opportunity cost. So let's say, let's just say
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   instead of that Ford F-150 or Dodge Ram, you got yourself a reasonably priced SUV,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   say like a Ford Explorer, Chevy Trailblazer. Now we're talking $30,000, $35,000 maybe.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   That cuts it in half. And let's be honest, if you're a young person, you don't need all the bells
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and whistles in a car. You don't need the sunroof. You don't need the leather seats. You don't need
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   the heated steering wheels. Oh, heated steering wheel in Michigan in the winter, I gotta say,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   is one of the best inventions of the past, however long it's been around for.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's amazing. I'm new to that. I'm new to that life. Our new vehicle has heated
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   steering wheel. I love it. That's great. The thing is, once you get those things, you are,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   that becomes a necessity, not a desire anymore. So once you get it, there's no going
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   back. So just take away all the amenities at first, right? So if
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   you cut it in half, go from $70,000 to $35,000, now we're talking like
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   $675,000 a month in savings. It's $8,000 a year,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   $40,000 over the life of the loan. I also looked at, what about a smaller truck? John,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   show a picture here before we get to this table. This is the Ford Maverick.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Let's say, okay, listen, I'm in construction. I do need a truck, Ben.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Okay, do you really need the biggest truck, though? This is a Ford Maverick. You know what this MSRP is for the Ford
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Maverick, what it starts at? $25,000. Okay?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Monthly payment goes from $1,350 to $500 a month. Now I'll show my
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   table, John. So I've shown three different options. The souped up truck, $1,350
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   a month. The SUV, $675,000 a month. Then the small
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   truck at $25,000 for the
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   truck and like $500 a month. You're saving $10,000 in
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   a year and $51,000 over the life of the loan for a smaller truck.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Right? Now, let's do the personal finance thing.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Now let's say you take these monthly savings, right, on both of these prices. You cut it in half or you cut
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   it even further. Let's say you save 75% of monthly payments, right? Not the whole thing.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You can blow the rest. Do whatever you want. You're a young person. Here's what those savings
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   look like in the stock market over 30 years. 7% on that.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   John, show the chart. Actually, give me the other chart, the next one.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Okay, so this is what happens if you just keep that lower
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   priced car and keep the spread for 30 years, right? You save that spread
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   every year for 30 years. Now we're talking, you know, high six figures, $600,000
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   to $800,000 range. Pretty eye-opening, right? But let's be honest.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   That's probably not realistic. If you're a big truck person, you're going to want a big truck
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   eventually, regardless of what the spreadsheets say. So John, show my next chart.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   What if you just save for the five years? So $25,000, you know,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   you don't need that big souped up truck. Get the Maverick and then after five
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   years when you're 30, then you do it. So just you save the difference for five years. One
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   period of the loan, right? Then you can buy your truck that'll pull a 747 down the runway.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Okay? This is just one-time deal. You save 75% of the difference
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   for just five years and let it grow. Now we're talking about the difference between that SUV
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   or a Ford Maverick and you're saving something
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   like $200,000, $250,000 over 30 years. This is the money chart, right?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Just one loan period. So hold off on the big truck for five years.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Hold off a used car or a smaller truck or an SUV for five years.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And then once you're in a better situation and maybe you're making more money, then you can get it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Right? So that's the idea. These are the graphs that he should show his young people
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   that, yeah, fine, get it eventually. You don't need it now.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Listen, I just think, especially for young people, if you're someone who's
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   saving money and you have your budget prioritized and you want
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   that $70,000 truck, who am I to tell you not to get it? But if you're a young person
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and you're not saving, you're not allowing compounding to do that heavy lifting for you.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I say, you know, of course, the hard part is you can't simply
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   buy a lower cost vehicle. You have to save the difference. Right? So I would just automate those savings.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You know, a six figure Roth IRA in 30 years
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   is going to do a lot more heavy lifting for you than a Ford F-150. Right? Boom.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Nailed it. I'm not trying to trigger anyone, but I see a lot of fancy, expensive
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   trucks and they don't have a single scratch or a drop of mud on them.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm just saying, I don't really think you need the truck.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   This guy is in construction and he's saying these other construction workers don't need it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Not everyone needs the brand new top of the line. That's all I'm saying.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Just do it for five years and let that money grow.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   These fancy trucks, they're nice. They're like luxury vehicles. They're really fancy inside.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I think a lot of people don't understand that. That's what you're paying a lot for in a lot of these cases.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   You're paying as much for a big truck as you are for a luxury vehicle. That's the thing.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's huge. I'm not saying skimp for the rest of your life.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Do it for at least the first one you get.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Trade down a little bit and let that money grow.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Don't get used to it because once you get used to it, there's no going back.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Just be okay with the fact that you might end up in a situation where you can't tow a train out of the way or something.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   That's true. Call one of your buddies who is not as financially sound as you.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You can bail him out of a financial hole. He can bail you out of a literal hole.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Next question.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   My wife is a physician and we're 37. We're in the 37% tax bracket.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   While treasury yields are currently excellent,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I'm struggling to figure out how treasuries and bonds make sense for us in the near term
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   given the tax implications and a brokerage account.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   After taxes, 5% treasuries would yield us about 3.1%, barely keeping up with inflation.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Outside of pure safety, why wouldn't I just invest in an already safe index fund
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   and enjoy the 7% annual gains and take the 20% capital gains rate
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   or just hold until we no longer have any income?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   All right. A lot of tax stuff here. I want to tackle this from the investing side of things,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   but let's bring in not only your tax advisor, my tax advisor, Bill Sweet.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   We were on the phone today. Bill was working out some tax stuff for me.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I was. He's a magician. I'm always on the clock.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It's true. I wanted to welcome you guys to the month of February too.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   February is the worst month of the year, but it's an honest month
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   because it's a month that doesn't hold up life any better than it really is.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Where's at the top of your month power rankings? Duncan?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It's definitely on the lower end. Isn't it a leap year though?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   It's a leap year. That's kind of cool. It is. It's a long month. Yeah, making it even worse.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I would put May on the top and February at the bottom. That's the mind list.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   This is the kind of stuff you talk about when you're a middle-aged dad. For the audience. Yeah, definitely.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Good thing they're not changing any tax laws way into the game.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Yeah, there was not a bill that passed the House last night at 8.37 p.m.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   The crazy thing is that it's retroactive, but that was not Sam's question here.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Yeah, you're going to have to give us a rundown of that eventually. I didn't quite get all the details.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I guess the way it works is your age matches your tax bracket
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   according to Sam. Not really. We talked before about
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   the differences in different types of bonds for tax purposes, right?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Yes. The tax notifications, muni bonds versus treasuries versus corporates, that sort of thing.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Now we're looking at treasury bonds versus
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   taxes. You obviously know this,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   but make the case here for why stocks are so much of a better
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   tax-deferred vehicle than bonds if we're investing in a brokerage account.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   To put things into perspective, Sam and his wife, they're 37% tax bracket.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   That's the top tax bracket. These are folks earning more than
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   $600,000 a year. God bless them. There's a lot of work that goes into that.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   When he said my wife is a physician, that was not to brag. Yeah, that was definitely not to brag in the
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   tax bracket, too. But the question Sam is kind of getting at
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   is, look, these treasury yields at 5%, they're really tasty.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Compared to two years ago, compared to any point since
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   1985, 1987, that's a really good yield on what
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   the market considers a risk-free rate of return, a 30-day T-bill.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   However, what Sam's pointing out is, look, my tax rate, the IRS
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   is taking more than two-thirds, or excuse me, one-third of this income.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   So his after-tax rate is only 3%. I would agree. And that happens
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   across the tax spectrum. So for somebody, Ben, earning $50,000
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   a year, their ordinary income rate is 12%, their capital gains rate is zero.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   For somebody earning $150K, it's 22% ordinary, 15%
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   capital gains, so there's still a 7% advantage there for capital
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   gains. And even at higher income ranges, it goes from 37%
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   to 24%. So you're still with a large 13% gap where you're getting
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   a better, effective tax rate on capital gains and things like tax-qualified
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   dividends over ordinary income. And so Sam is going down the right path.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The real benefit, though, Ben, is not just in tax rates, but it's in
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   deferral. But it's the compounding, right? Correct. If you
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   have a treasury that you're owning in a brokerage account, in a non-qualified account, you're paying that
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   tax today, in 2024, on that earnings, relative
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   to a capital gain that's getting deferred. I don't know, Ben, if it's exactly
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   apples-to-apples, right? I don't know if you would compare a compound annual growth rate to a stock
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   compared to a treasury yield. You know, the treasury yield is basically guaranteed by the
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   full faith and credit of the United States government, whereas we don't know what the next 5, 10
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   years of stocks are going to yield. We do know the dividend rate, so we can approximate it. But that's
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   really the big gap, is that really you get to defer on the tax versus paying
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   the tax now. Right, which is one of the reasons that those tax deferred retirement vehicles are so nice.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   You have to pay the taxes eventually, if it's not a Roth, but you're allowing the compounding
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   to happen. You don't have to pay taxes on the dividends every year. You don't have to pay taxes if you
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   rebalance, that sort of thing. Yep. You're exactly right.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   My question is, how often do you let the tax tail
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   wag the investment portfolio a dog? Because I get that from a taxable perspective.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Stocks look way better, but does that mean that you should
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   just shun bonds altogether because the yields are going to be lower on an after-tax
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   basis, and you go 100% stocks? I don't know.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I think the investing side of the equation should probably have
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   a say here, too. Correct? Yeah, 100%. In fact, that's probably
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   the end of this story, and that's how I would argue it. Sam, I would look at, hey, this is an investment
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   opportunity. I'm going to own this. Think about top-down asset allocation.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Ben, you and I do this for a living. You would fail your CFP or CFA exam if
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   you tried to hand-jam based on where the current interest rates are. You would decide, look,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I want to own treasuries. I want to own stocks. Where does it make sense to own those?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I think what I would flip the argument in his head, Sam, is say, look, it would make more sense
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   for me if I have a high income, which Sam and his wife do, and I'm earning
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   income, I'm rebalancing, blah, blah, blah. I would want to own ordinary income devices
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   in tax-deferred accounts because the yields are great. We want to own that somewhere,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   but you want that in a tax-deferred structure anyway because then you get the higher yields
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   in a tax-deferred account versus owning stocks and other tax-qualified
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   assets in non-qualified accounts where you don't have to pay the tax now because
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   of the deferral outside of dividends, and then you can pick and choose when you want to pay your tax.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Think about this top-down from a portfolio allocation,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   not bottom-up from this is a good investment. Also, when do you need to spend
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   the money? Some people need to own bonds or cash because it's an emotional hedge
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and they can't take the volatility of the stock market, so they need to have something else
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   that takes that volatility down a notch. Other people, it's more
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   for spending needs. Do you have goals coming up that you need to spend that money?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I have money in an online savings account and some T-bills, and I know that
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   that stuff is not nearly as tax-efficient, and it's not going to give me the same return
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   over the long run as the stock market, but I don't care because it's there when I need to spend the money.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That's what you have to think about first is, "Is that money going to be there when I need to spend it?"
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You skipped to the point that I wanted to end on, which is these types of vehicles are great
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   for spending your money today. If you're in distribution phase, you want this high yield. You want this high
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   income because the dollars are going out the door anyway. You probably do not want this type
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   of income if you have a high savings rate. He calls index funds
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   safe, but it's relative. They're still risky in the short term for sure.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Correct. Final point for me, you do get a state tax advantage with treasuries, as we discussed
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   on Ask the Compound '92. Was that a real number,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   or did you make it up? I just made it up. I was about to say, "Wow, you've got a good memory."
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   You got me. You guys are supposed to play along.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Close enough. Next question.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Up next, we have a question from Benjamin. "I'm considering maxing
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   out 401(k) and IRA contributions for my wife and I. My employer
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   contributes to an ESOP." You're going to have to remind me what that stands for.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Employee Stock Option Plan. That's it. And profit sharing programs
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   as well. "I have a co-worker who claims there is a maximum amount
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   of contributions for deferred compensation and tax advantage retirement accounts.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Consequently, he avoids contributing to his IRA in case his total contributions
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   end up being too high when combined with 401(k), ESOP,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   profit sharing, and other deferred comp programs the company has
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   for high earners. Is there any such maximum?"
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   See, Bill, I always complain about this to you, that we should just have one big
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   pooled maximum for everyone. But there's all these different accounts and moving pieces
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   and 401(k) limits and IRA limits. And then there's income limits on the IRAs.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And then you have SEP IRAs and
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   individual 401(k)s and Employee Stock Option Plans.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Okay, so who's right here? Benjamin or the co-worker? Because I feel like you have to settle that debate first.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Yeah, I think so. And I want to talk about a really interesting policy proposal kind of at the end.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   But I think the answer to Benjamin's question is it's super-duper
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   complex. I think that's where we would land this.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Duncan, ESOP is an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And in these types of things, integrated with a 401(k) plan, there are a bunch of limits
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   to keep in mind. Limit number one, there's a $23,000
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   402(g) salary deferral limit that each person can put
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   into a 401(k) each year. And then there's a $69,000
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   this year, 415(c) limit. And the interplay of those two limits
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   is very, very important. The 415, the 69,000, that is a
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   hard cap, Ben. You cannot exceed that on a per-employee basis, or you have
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   to distribute the money to the employee's benefit. In ESOP, an Employee Stock
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Ownership Plan, it's this really funky hybrid of equity, company stock
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and retirement vehicles. And the total company contributions cannot
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   exceed that 69,000, which also includes the 402(g)
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   salary deferral limit. So the employee is correct.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   You kind of do need to know this stuff in advance. Unfortunately, most companies
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   don't close their books until the following tax year, when it's too late to do a
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   402(g) limit. My general advice would be contribute up to the maximum
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   anyway, because the company's going to match it or not. You're just going to get the money back if it's too
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   much. But I do want to give Ben point here at the end.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And that's the IRA limits don't have anything to do with these complicated 402,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   415(c) limits. So the IRA's got nothing to do with it in my equation.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So if we're doing IRA plus 401(k) plus
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   the SEP limit, we're pushing 100(k). And that's not including
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   any company match for the 401(k). If you balance it all together, right? And just very
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   confusingly, a SEP IRA doesn't follow the IRA rules. It does for distribution purposes,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   but not for contribution purposes. So you're even bringing a third animal into this.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It's kind of crazy to me that they give business owners such a bigger
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   break on the contribution limits. Why is it so much higher? Is this just a, who knows?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Yeah, I don't have a good answer. I think it's just the way that the tax code developed over time. And these limits
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   were much, much smaller. And as they've compounded in inflation and Congress has tried to
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   incentivize retirement savings, they've gotten bigger, right? But speaking of inflation,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   that's been a positive inflation as these contribution limits have moved up quite a bit in the last few years, right?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   That's true. Fair point. Yeah. And especially if you compounded over the last 20. But yeah.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   At the end of the day, I think I would look at this all in, again, totality
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and say, look, what can I control here? You can control your own savings rate.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You probably should fund the retirement vehicle. And don't let that door close.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And again, the worst case scenario, your company, oh no, your company contributes $69,000
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   to a retirement account on your behalf. That's a great problem to have. You're just going to
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   take the 23K out, get a distribution, and then spend it as you see fit. I think that's a great problem
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   to have. Okay. That's what I was about to ask you. Whose job is it to keep track
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   of this? Is the employer issuing this, keeping track of limits? Or you just as the individual
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   have to keep track of all this? Yeah. No, the plan sponsor would, Duncan. The plan sponsor,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   whoever's running the plan. And yeah, there are some very high income people
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   that get paid to do all this math and to give the answer. And the reason people want to max these things out
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   if they can is because of the tax deferral we talked about in the last question. Correct. Yep.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   So it's a big deal and it's a good problem to have. But yeah, I would fund your IRA
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   separate from any of this because IRAs, they don't come into this company in limits.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Perfect. Good to know. Next one.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Cool. Okay. So last but not least, we got a nice short one.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   We have a nine-year-old and a six-month-old. Do I need two individual 529
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   accounts for them? Since they are pretty far apart, I was wondering if we can use the same
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   account for both of them. All right. This is a quick answer. So you give it and then I got a follow-up for you.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Yeah, shoot. So the answer is, yeah, you can just use the same account during the
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   accumulation phase. And you can name one beneficiary. 529s have
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   an account owner that owns the account. And then they're making contributions and saving
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   for a beneficiary. And most 529s plans allow you to change the name
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   of that beneficiary at least once a year. And so in theory, during the accumulation
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   phase, Ben, let's say the first 18 years of a child's life, you can contribute to 1529
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and then split the account, do a rollover, rename the beneficiary to the second
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   beneficiary, and then start distributing there. Or just use one account for your full needs,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   if that's what you really want to do. I will say, I actually used
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   different accounts for each kid because it was just
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   psychologically easier for me. So I could bucket them out. Yeah. And then you don't have to
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   pick and choose who you love more and which name goes in the account.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   By the way, Bill, is that two live crew on your phone right there? I tried to mute my phone
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   during the call because I noticed I got a notification. And yeah, it started wrapping at me.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   So that's New York for you. I have a follow-up for you. So on AnimalSpirits this week,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   we were looking at college tuition. John Throat up here. And over the past 10 years, college tuition
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   has actually lagged the overall inflation rate. It really flipped recently.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   But that's surprising to a lot of people who have seen college prices go up and up and up.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And it's finally starting to roll over a bit. So Michael, my co-host on the show,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   said, wait a minute. What if I'm actually saving too much in my 529 plans for my boys?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Is that a problem? And I said, well, as Bill Sweet
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   would say, you can eventually convert them to Roth IRAs if you don't spend it all. Correct?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Yep. Correct. Up to $35,000 per beneficiary. Correct. With this
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   FanDuel account, does he really even need a 529?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I think he's doing pretty well. They don't have a Roth IRA option for FanDuel. But I did want to sneak in.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Most 529 planned accounts are per contribution, but some
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   are per beneficiary. And so, Ben, that would be one reason in the state of Georgia, at $2,000
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   per beneficiary, you get a higher tax deduction if you do that on a, like I said,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   per beneficiary basis. Taxpayers, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   among others, would potentially benefit from having multiple 529s if they have multiple kids.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Okay. All right. I have one follow-up for you on the tax stuff. This mortgage is going to come
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   out. But what's the biggest two or three big points of the new tax legislation
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   that passed last night that will make sense for people?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Yeah. For individual taxpayers, to be honest, Ben, not a lot, particularly if your income
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   exceeds, let's say, $50,000 or $100,000, because most of the individual changes
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   had to do with refundable child tax credits. So if you have a child
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and you're slightly lower income, you get a higher tax refund, potentially.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Most of the changes on the business side had to do with bonus depreciation and R&D
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   credits. And they're relatively wonky. It's not a headline, in my view.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   But the headline for me is that why is Congress mucking with the tax code
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   retroactively to 2023 in the month of February? That would
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   mean to be the question of potential dysfunction. People are filing tax returns
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   right now. So I guess just as a policy question, why are we doing this
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   a year after the fact? It is crazy. There's no line in the sand on this stuff, that you can go
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   backwards. Yeah. Well, Congress makes the laws around here. Are tax professionals
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   like you supposed to plan ahead if you're changing the rules after the fact? I mean, that's the thing. And
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   they continue to cut IRS funding, frankly. And that might be a political priority for some.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   But what it means for the rest of us is it's more difficult to file a tax return. You're right,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Ben. If you filed a tax return already, there might be some additional
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   refunds that you won't be touching for six to eight weeks because Congress is mucking with the tax
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   code very, very late in the year. So we'll see how this all lands out. It's going to
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   be the Senate, and then it needs to get signed by the president to law.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But yeah, this is a moving target. And you get it live here in NASA Compound.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Also, on the topic of taxes for our new people here and young people here,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I find a lot of people don't understand that you can still be contributing to an
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   IRA for 2023 this far into 2024.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I just topped off my SEP IRA for 2023 this
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   month. That's great. Not to brag, Ben Carlson. Retroactively, yes.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Yeah, but yeah, April 15th is the IRA contribution limit for tax
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   year 2023. And you're right, Duncan. Wow, we got so much more time. But that means if you
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   put a 2023 contribution in now, you get 2023 stock market returns too.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Not quite. Unfortunately, yeah. Time machine, we're still working on that.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Can I get a ruling on you guys? Non-alcoholic beer during the day.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Is that a no, or how does that land for you guys? I love it. I'm just curious.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I walked by the NA section in the store this morning, and it's getting
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   bigger and bigger. That's a good question. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   What does it say about me? That's what I'm curious about for you guys. I mean, you're going to get judged
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   because people will think it's real. Yeah, it's kind of edgy.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I love on the edge. Yeah, I like it. We're changing the tax code this week, guys.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I'm living on the edge. All right. Yeah,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   sure. Have at it. I approve.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I don't know. All right. Thanks to Bill Sweet, as always,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   for being our resident tax expert. It's good to see you in New York this week, Ben. It was fun. I was in New York
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   for a couple days. Got to help these guys liven in person.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   New Compound & Friends tomorrow. Remember, email
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   us at AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Thanks for all the people in the live
