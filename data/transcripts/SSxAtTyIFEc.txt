[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.800]   We have a question here from Patrick.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:16.000]   Patrick asks, how would you approach including non-work activities into my workday?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.900]   Well, if it's during the actual hours of your workday, so after your time block plan begins,
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.400]   but before you do your shutdown ritual for the day, you just time block it.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   You just time block it like any other thing you would do.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.300]   In fact, time blocking it allows you to find the best times for scheduling this non-work related activity.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600]   You have some control over where that's going to fall, so it's not just happening randomly.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.300]   You're more likely to get more of it done.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.300]   I do this, for example, with exercising and for sure with book reading,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300]   where I'll just block off a time for book reading.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.700]   The other thing you can do is just shut your days down earlier on some days.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.700]   So I can end my day at 3.30, full schedule shutdown complete, 3.30 to 5.30,
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.100]   I'm doing my leisure activity I'm really into.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.900]   That's a great period.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.100]   I love that end of the day period where other people are working, but you're done
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   because you're organized and you're in control, and you can end that day early without it being a crisis
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.300]   because you've controlled all of your time, you've controlled your weeks,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.600]   you've controlled your semester plans, and so you might try doing that as well.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.700]   But just time block that like anything else.
