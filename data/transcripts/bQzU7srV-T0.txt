[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   We kill each other because we disagree on something that happened 2,000 years ago.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.720]   The Crusaders and the Shia and the Muslims.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.120]   And because of that, we kill each other.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.040]   And oh, a piece of land, we also disagree on the name of a piece of land,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   and I'm willing to literally end your life because this land is mine and it's not yours.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.560]   A lot of these things for an alien sound ridiculous.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.000]   And for us, it's daily life.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.400]   And I think my mission statement in life is to recognize
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.880]   what needs to change on planet Earth and spend the rest of my life contributing to that.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.000]   And so that's why my mission statement is bring people together.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.040]   I'm from Israel and Palestine, and that's a crazy thing.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   So I'd like to help in that regard.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.120]   I'd like to help get people to spend less time wearing ropes around their neck.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000]   I'd like people to stop killing each other
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720]   because they're a different color or shade over an eye or whatever.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.000]   That's my life statement.
