[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   Dating is inherently deceptive.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.300]   You know what?
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.980]   If you were a total loser, and you would amount to nothing,
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.600]   and you would add value to no one,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.560]   and no one would respect you,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.280]   but I would still marry you, how would you feel?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.760]   - Ooh! - Why am I the bad guy?
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.760]   The world is the bad guy!
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400]   Isn't this good?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.760]   Isn't it good that you have a husband who wants this?
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.980]   Alright, welcome to the Official/Unofficial Axe2 Network podcast.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.960]   We are launching lifelong Kingdom workers from every college town.

[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.500]   We want to talk about probably the most interesting topic to college students today,
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.380]   which is AI.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.220]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.500]   We want to talk about dating and marriage.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.180]   But before we get into it, why don't you guys introduce yourselves real quick.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.600]   Just what year did you graduate?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.940]   Tour some of your peers around our network and just where you're serving.

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   It's important because they feel like we're there.

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   Irvine doesn't know either.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   So it's fine.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   I'm going to say both daughters.

[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   I was a sophomore at the time.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   And then we were not always in the same kind of.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   grouping.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040]   As undergrads.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   But.

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   So.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   We kind of knew each other throughout undergrad.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   Served together.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   After.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   I was a little shocked when he called me actually.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   Oh.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   He didn't see it coming at all.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   Joe called me.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   And then I was like.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   Uh.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   Do you have the right person on the other.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   Um.

[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   Cause I had never even thought about him.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   So then.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   When he called me.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   It was a little shocking.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   No, no.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   Because I felt like.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   Oh.

[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   Too above my range.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   Wow.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   What a compliment.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   Oh my god.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   I mean.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   That's not how I thought at all.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   For me.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   I was.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   Okay.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   Maybe this is too.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   Too serious.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   But like.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   Uh.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   A wife.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   That I could do ministry with.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   That was really what I was looking for.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   My.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   Home church pastor.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   Loved the.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   He was the first man of God.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Who just.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   Like.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   I saw him sacrifice.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   So much.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   For our youth group.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   Um.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   His wife.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   Was not that involved.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   And so I saw him kind of burn out.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   Actually.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Trying to serve the youth group.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   I really want to find a wife.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   Who is going to be.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   My equal.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040]   At least.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   Um.

[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   I was like.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   Boom.

[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Mission trips.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   And things like that.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   Are great.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   It's a great context.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   To kind of get to know someone.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   So.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   Look around.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   That's not why you should go.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   While you're there.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Jesus.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   For Jesus.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   So I just.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040]   I just.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   I guess I saw her in a different way.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   I knew her.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   Uh.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   You know.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   Throughout undergrad and stuff like that.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   But just.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   Seeing her zeal.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   And like.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   Her.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   How.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   How hard she worked.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   It was very appealing to me.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   Um.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   The only thing was.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   Um.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   She was really bossy.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   Okay.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   Okay.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   I gotta tell this story though.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040]   Okay.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   What do you think now?
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   Wait.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   I am still bossy.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   Why do you think she's bossy?
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   Character ratio.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   I'm working on it.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   But.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   But.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   Uh.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   So.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   We were dating for about a.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   Gosh.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   I think it was maybe.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   We were a month in.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   Maybe a month and a half.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   And we're having lunch.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   And then.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   Eating really yummy Korean food.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   He goes.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Hey.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   So.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   Is there anything that you're concerned about me?
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   Like.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   About me.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   Like.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   Wow.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   Okay.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   I'm serious.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   So.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040]   So.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   I say.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040]   Well.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   I've heard that you're kind of mechanical.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   You know.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   Like.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040]   You're kind of mechanical.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   And he's like.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   I'm working on that.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   Well.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   For you.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   You're um.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   You're pretty bossy.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   Like.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   When we were in Cambodia.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   I was like.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   Dang.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   She's bossy.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   So.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   I was like.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   Oh.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   And you're like.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.040]   I didn't ask.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040]   But the topic.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   It felt a little bit like that.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   So.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   I'm sure.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   That's how it felt for her emotionally.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   Um.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   But.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   I thought.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   Surely.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   She would have some things about me.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   That she would.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   Find concerning.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   Um.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.040]   Because.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   Again.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   After that conversation.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   After that conversation.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.040]   I had a few concerns.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   Now that she mentioned mine.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   Wow.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   You know.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   For me.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   It's like.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.040]   I.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   I just.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   I.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   I wanted to.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   I'm a pretty simple person.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   And straightforward.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   Maybe too straightforward.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   So.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   Um.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   I wanted to talk about it.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   Kind of getting out.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   Getting out in the open.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   Wow.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   He's a serious dude.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   Serious dude.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   What are some.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   Highlights.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040]   That you'd be willing to share.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   Oh.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   Maybe.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   This is your chance to set the record straight.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   On.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Some.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   Maybe some stories that have.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   Accumulated.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   Legendary.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   Features.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   Over time.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   I think you gotta say.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   Which one you're okay with.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   Cause there's just so much.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   There are a lot.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   There are a lot.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   There are a lot.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   Um.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   Is it more of the same kind of.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   Pattern?
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   I guess.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   I think so.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   He's a serious dude.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   Alright.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Um.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   Are you gonna make him tell it?
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   No.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   No.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040]   He just needs to give me permission.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   To tell which one.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040]   You know.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   Maybe you should give him some options.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   I already gave him many options.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   Oh.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   We're good.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.040]   Okay.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   Well we got time.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   We got time.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   Alright.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   Okay.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   You wanna tell the supermodel story?
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040]   Okay.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   Sure.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   Okay.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   So this one's a classic.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   Our students get a kick out of this one.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   We tell this one frequently.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   We're on a lunch date.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   And then somehow the topic of.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   Oh.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.040]   Um.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   What kind of girls does your brother like?
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   Comes up.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   And he goes.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.040]   I have an older brother.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   Older brother.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040]   Um.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Alpha female.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   Prettiest.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   Smartest.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   The one that all the guys wanna date.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   And he goes.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   But I don't care about that stuff.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.040]   I'm like.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   I'm like.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.040]   Ah.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   You know.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   And I'm like.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   You know.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   I could find that like.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   Kind of offensive.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   And then he goes.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   Why?
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   You know what?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   Let's not talk about this anymore.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   You know what?
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   Let's not talk about this anymore.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   Let's move on.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   He goes.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   No.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   I don't understand.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   So then.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   So then.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   I'm like.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   You know what?
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   Let's not talk about this anymore.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   You know what?
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   Let's not talk about this anymore.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.040]   Um.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   Let's move on.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.040]   He goes.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   No.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   I don't understand.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   So then.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   So then.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   So then.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   I say.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   Okay.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   So.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   Like.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.040]   You're insinuating something about me.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   By saying what you just said.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   Um.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   He's like.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   Okay.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   I don't understand.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   And I was like.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   Okay.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   So.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   Never heard.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   Oh really?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   Short fat bald guy.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   And then.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   And then he's like.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040]   So I would feel more comfortable.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   Like if you said that.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   You're fine with short fat bald guys.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   Anyway.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040]   So basically.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   Like.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   I keep trying to.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   Like.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   Go away from this topic.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.040]   I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   But he just.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   He starts ramping up at me.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   Like.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040]   He gets mad at me.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   Right?
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040]   He's ramping up.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040]   And I'm like.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   I just.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   You know what?
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   Can we just not talk about.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   I don't understand.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   Um.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   Okay.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   Like.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   I don't really want to talk about this anymore.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   And then.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   He's like ramping up.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   And he goes.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.040]   Well.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   It's not like you're a supermodel or something.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   Uh huh.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   So.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   What did you do?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   So at that point.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   I just.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   I.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   I didn't know what to do.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   You know.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   So I just.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   I said.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   You know what Joe.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   I've never thought I was a supermodel.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   Like ever in my life.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   And I said.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   But I think I'm done with lunch.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   Okay.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   So then I wrap up.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   And then I get up.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   And then I.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   I'm walking to the car.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   I probably realized.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   Oh.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   I probably said something wrong.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   So he's.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   Like scurrying after me.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   He's like.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   Okay.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   I'll see you later.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   And then I'm like.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   And I close the door.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   And I peel out.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   Right.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   About 10-15 minutes later.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   He calls me.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   And he goes.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   Uh.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   I think you're beautiful.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   There was definitely a question mark at the end of it.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   So.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   That's a good move.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   So when I talk to other sisters about it.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   They're like.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   You gotta take the full package.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.040]   Um.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Wow.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   How long into our relationship was that?
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   I think that was maybe like.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   Two.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   Two.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   Three months.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   Something like that.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   Two.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   Three months.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   It's probably around there.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   But he has this whole reason and everything.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   Like.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   You have to give him the back story.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   Like.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   It's cause.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   Women are insecure.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   And you know.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   Men.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   Well.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   Okay.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.040]   Um.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   Joe does not want to talk about this.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   I grew up with very few female friends.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   I just hung out with the bros.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   His dad apologized to me.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   Like.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040]   When he met me.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   Knowing that.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040]   You know.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   I had an older brother.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   probably just rough housing all the time.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   So.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   I really didn't understand.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   Like.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   The female psyche.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   Mm.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   Um.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   But.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   You know.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   Like I mentioned earlier.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   Really what I wanted.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.040]   Was.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   Uh.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   Someone who was gonna be a good wife.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   A good mom.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   And a good minister.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   That's really what I cared about.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   Someone who loved Jesus.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.040]   And someone who's gonna do that.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   Like.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   With me.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   Mm.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Till the end.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   Partner until we die.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   That's what I was looking for.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   Mm.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   I didn't care.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040]   About.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   Like.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   The world's beauty standards.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   Mm.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   Stuff like that.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   Was not.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   Like.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   Something I.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   Like.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   Was not high on my list.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Mm.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   And I thought.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Surely that's a good thing.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   Here's the world.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.040]   Amen.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   Take notes.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   Here's the world.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   Telling women.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   That.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Their worth is defined by their.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   By their appearance.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   In fact.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   That's.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   Now that I have daughters.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   I understand it a little bit more.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   Because I see it in them.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   And how much it affects them.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   Mm.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   But it's.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   It's really crazy.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   I actually hate that part of the world.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   Mm.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   That tells women.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   That their values about their appearance.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   Okay.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   So.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   There's that.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   Now I'm like.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   I don't care about that stuff.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   I care about.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040]   Your character.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   I care about.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   Isn't that.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   A good thing.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040]   Isn't it a good thing.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   It is.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040]   That's the thing.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   That's what makes it so confusing.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   The one who wants to date you.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   Like your husband.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   That's true.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   I agree.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   Like.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Is not about that.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   And just.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   Cares about.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   Your soul.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   Like.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.040]   That's what I didn't understand.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Why am I the bad guy.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   The world is the bad guy.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   I.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   I.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   I.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   Isn't this good.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   Isn't it good that you have a husband who wants this.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   That's what I.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   Didn't understand.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   I was getting ramped up.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   And I was just.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   I just.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   I don't know what to say to that.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   Cause that's.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   So.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   So I thought about it.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   So I thought about it.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.040]   And I realized.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   I spent some time journaling about it.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.040]   Cause I.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040]   After this incident.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.040]   What's going on.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   So.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   And I realized.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   I realized.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   Um.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   Actually when she said.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.040]   You know.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   If you were a short fat bald guy.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   Like how would you feel.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   In other words.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   She flipped it on me.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   And actually my.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   Honest emotional reaction was.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   Oh.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   That would be great.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   Why don't you feel that way.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   It's kind of how I was feeling right.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   But I realized.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   It's because.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   Generally speaking.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.040]   The thing that women are insecure about.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   And men are insecure about.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   Are very different.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   Men are not insecure about their looks.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   Generally speaking.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   So they don't care.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   And we're all kind of deluded.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   Right.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   So I actually had to.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040]   Translate it.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   And then.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   I thought.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   I sort of ran this.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   Thought experiment.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   If she said.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   You know what.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.040]   If you were a total loser.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.040]   And you would amount to nothing.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   And you would add value to no one.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   And no one would respect you.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   But I would still marry you.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.040]   How would you feel.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040]   That's.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   That's when I was like.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   That hurts.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   Wow.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   And I go.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   That's what she was feeling.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   Because.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   Her source of insecurities.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   Is.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   Is in that.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   And that's what I touched.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040]   And.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   And if I had to translate it.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   To this.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   To the male thing.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   I was like.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   Oh.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   That would have hurt actually.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   A lot.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   And that's when I realized.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   I did a bad thing.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   So that's when.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   I kind of.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   We talked about it.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   I apologize.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   Is that when you called and said.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   No, no, no.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   That was.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   That was just.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   I didn't know what to do.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   It was.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   I kind of thought about it later that night.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   And sort of.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   Wow.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   Did you share all those insights with her?
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   Like.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   I did.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Afterwards.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   Oh.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   I think you only shared it after we were married.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Oh really?
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   I was grateful for a thoughtful husband.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040]   Wow.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   Someone who would journal about that.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   After it happening.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   It was very thoughtful.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   I don't know how many guys would do that.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   That's amazing.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   Marriage has caused me to journal more than anything.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's been good.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   Praise the Lord.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   Wow.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   Wow.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   Okay.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   I don't know if we're going to top that one.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   But.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   Should we.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   Should we.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   I forgot what we were talking about.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   So tell us more about marriage.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040]   Oh.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   I'm just.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   I'm like so.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   I'm just trying to process.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   It's like I'm learning things.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   This is like.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   This is a little much right now.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   Okay.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   So okay.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   Well okay.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   Let's move on.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   So on that note.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   I feel like.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   We'll have a bonus episode with them later.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   Where we'll have more of these stories.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   And just get some wisdom I think.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   But.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   Okay.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   So on that note.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   We do want to talk about dating.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   And.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   I feel like dating is one of these things where.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   It's sort of.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   It's in the air.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   At our church.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   I mean it's in the air.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   In college of course.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   Everyone's thinking about dating.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   The reality is there's some sort of stigma attached to it.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   And at least like.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   I don't know.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   I'm just going to share my experience.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   At Rutgers.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   I mean it's like we never talk about dating.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   Actually.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   I don't think I've.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   I preach every Sunday.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   I don't think I've ever preached about it.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   Or.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   Hasn't really come up in discipleship or anything.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   Um.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   But.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   Even despite that.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   Like I think.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   There is this sort of sense that like.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   Oh.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   Acts 2 network.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   Anti dating.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   I think if I had to sum it up.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   That's an oversimplification.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   But that is sort of the sense.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   Puritanical.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   So.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   I.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   We did hear that you guys.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   About once a year.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   You do have like a little seminar.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   On the.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   On the dating topic.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   So we just want to hear like.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   How.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   What are your thoughts about.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   Specifically.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   Undergrads.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   Dating.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   Like.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   For it.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   Against it.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   What do you think about it.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   And what's some wisdom that you shared.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   Maybe just.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   Break it down for us a little.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   Sure.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   So we ended up doing that.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   Because.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   That's one of the most popular topics.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   For office hours.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   And I just kept talking about it.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   Every week.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   Different people.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   I thought.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   Hey.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   Might as well just kind of.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   Put it all together.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   So everyone here at the same time.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040]   Because I think it's a hugely important topic.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   Kind of how you started.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.040]   Because a lot of people.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   Kind of think that we have a stance on it.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   And.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040]   I have to keep telling people.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   We don't.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   Like.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.040]   As far as I know.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   At least.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   I think we.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   I think it's fair to say.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   We used to.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   Like.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   Back in the day.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   Like.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   I don't know how far back.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   But.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040]   It has changed.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   It's changed.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   The reality is.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   I don't think we do anymore.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   So.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   A lot of.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   principles.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   Principles.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   And how that works out.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   In your life.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   So.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   Um.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   So.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   I guess.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   I don't know.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   There's a lot that goes into that.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   Like.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   Dating.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   Again.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   Because it's a huge topic.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   There's a lot of wisdom around it.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   There's a lot of ways to think about it.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   But I guess if I had to like.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   Boil it down.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   Um.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   I guess it would be.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   Like.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   Let's look at the bible.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   For what it says about dating.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   Okay.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   It doesn't say anything.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   There's nothing.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   There's nothing.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   There's nothing.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   There's nothing in there.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   End of discussion.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   Right.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   See you later.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040]   It's.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   It.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   Dating didn't exist back then.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   Right.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   So.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   So how do you think biblically about dating.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   Well you gotta start with what you know.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   Right.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   Start with what you know.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   And then extrapolate that to.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   To how it can plan out.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   So.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   So then.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   Like.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   The bible says a lot about marriage though.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   And it says.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.040]   That marriage is like.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   Incredibly important.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   Like.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   The kind of relationship between a.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   Husband and wife.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   Is that you become one flesh.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   That.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   Should never separate.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   Except for like.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   Really extreme situations.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   So.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   It's like.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   Incredibly important.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   Such a powerful.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   Relationship.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   If that's the case.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   It should be treated as such.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   A lot of people told me.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   Marriage is like the second.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Most important decision.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   You'll ever make in your life.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   After your decision to become Christian.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   Right.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   I can see that.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   So.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   Then we gotta treat that with a lot of care.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.040]   Cause you don't wanna mess that up.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   It's a beautiful gift that God has given us.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   But.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   The.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   The more beautiful something is.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   The more ugly it can become.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   If it isn't treated properly.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   So.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   So then what is dating.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   It's kinda getting ready for marriage.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   So you wanna do that.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   Really really well.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   So then in terms of like.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   How to.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   How to date and all that.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   There's a lot of wisdom there.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   But I think what most undergrads.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Wanna know is.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   When can I start dating.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   Am I ready.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   When can I start dating.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040]   And for that.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   Usually what I tell them.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   Is something along the lines of.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   When you're ready to be married in a few years.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   If you're ready to be married in a few years.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   Mm.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   If you're ready to be married in a few years.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.040]   That's a good time to start dating.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   Mm.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   Um.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   And I guess like.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.040]   Really it comes down to.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   Practically.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   Um.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   I just think it's really hard to date someone for like five, six years and not be married.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   Mm.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   God wants.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   The boundary of sex to be within a marriage.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   To enhance that marriage.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   To seal that marriage.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Consummate that marriage.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   And to date someone that you're very attracted to.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   For five years.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.040]   And not consummate that relationship.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Is actually really, really hard.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Mm.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   I think the world solution of just.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   You know, premarital sex is not what.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.040]   It's not God honoring.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   That's not what God would want.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   So.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   Mm.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   Just practically speaking.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   To start dating.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Mm.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   Uh.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   Looking towards marriage.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   But doing it.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   When you're practically ready to be married in a few years.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   Mm.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   So do you guys have like at Irvine.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Um.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   You guys have couples who are dating.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   And how do you go about like ministering to them.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   And like yeah.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   So.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   We do have a couple undergrads who are dating.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   And it really is case by case.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.040]   It just kind of depends on the person.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   And um.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   How well we know them.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   And then um.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   How much they want to talk about it.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   You know.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   It's always permission based.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   So.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   Hey.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   If this is something you guys want to talk about.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   Receive wisdom about.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   We are available to you.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   Uh.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   And some people take us up on that.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   And some people don't.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   Give up to them.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   So there's no like.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040]   I don't know.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   Does that.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   Does that cause like.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   I don't know.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   Drama.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040]   Or like.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   Do people break up.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   Like.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   You know.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   Again.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   Depends on the couple.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   And then some.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Some like.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   Are not.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   But doesn't cause drama.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.040]   Some.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   Some are.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   And does.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   Inevitably cause drama.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   Right.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   So yeah.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   It just kind of depends.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Like a college pastor.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   Is.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   Like.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   Okay.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   So traditionally.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   One thing that.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   I've always thought is.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   And that.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   I think our church has practices.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   Hey.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   We don't want to.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.040]   Like a flirtatious environment.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   So for me.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   It's like.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   That's fine.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   Like.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   It's.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   I mean.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   It's your life.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   I'm not.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   You're an adult.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   I'm not going to control you.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   But.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   If you come in.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   You start to like.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   Shift the atmosphere.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   And the culture of my.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Of our group.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Then it does sort of.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   Veer into the territory.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   Of like.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   Okay.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   Do I need to do something.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   About that.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   So.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   I'm just wondering.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   How have you guys.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Thought about that.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   And like.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   What are some conclusions.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   Or.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Kind of practices.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   That you've drawn.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   Hmm.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   In our hearts.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   As like.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   A ministering couple.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   Trying to.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   Help non-Christians.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   Come into an environment.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   Where they're not being distracted.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   By a lot of the.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   Kind of meat market.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   Kind of mentality.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   Where everybody's scoping.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   Everybody else out.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   So.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.040]   I mean.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   When we talk about.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040]   I guess.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   One of the reasons.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   Why we talk about it.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   On like.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   An annual basis.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   I guess.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Is because.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   We want to talk about.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   How it affects.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   The culture.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   How it affects.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   The overall atmosphere.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   The reality that.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   We're interested in.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   Allowing anybody to hear.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   About the gospel.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Anybody and everybody.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   Who's.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   Who's desiring to.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   And.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   If you have.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.040]   This atmosphere.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   Where people are like.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   Scoping each other out.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   Or there's lots of PDA.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   And then everybody's kind of yearning.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   And then everybody's kind of yearning.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   For that.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   How much of a distraction.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   That can become.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   From them being able to hear.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   From the word of God.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   Or from them.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   Even investigating.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   Because they feel like.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   They don't belong in.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   There's a.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   There's a testimonial.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   That we actually share.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   During the.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   I guess.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   The dating courtship talk.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   That we have.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   Where.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   There was a non-Christian guy.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   He wanted to check out church.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   He goes to his friends church.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   And then like.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   You know.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   His friends with him.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   But as soon as the girls arrive.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040]   He dips.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040]   Like.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   He's like.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   Standing there.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   By himself at church.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   He doesn't even know.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   What to do.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   Because it's church.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   You know.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   But basically.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   All the guys.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   Are like.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Trying to get the attention.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   Of the girls.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   And the girls are interested.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   In getting attention.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   Of the guys.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   And then.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   So this new guys.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   Non-Christian.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   Wants to hear about the gospel.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   But he's like.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   This is not the place for me.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   Um.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   And so.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   As we kind of share.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   About testimonies like that.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   Or.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   Um.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   I think personally.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   We'll have conversations.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   With people.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   If we have enough relationship.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   With them.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   Like.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   Hey.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   Like.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   If you could cool it.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   A little bit.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   Because.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   Like.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   This is an area.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   That people are struggling with.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   And if they don't have that relationship.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   It can be distraction.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   For them.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   So we do actually.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   Have pretty straight up conversations.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   With people.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   But you know.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   In the end.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   Like.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   Like.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   People take it well.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   On the whole.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   I think.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Well.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   I don't know.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   I just.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   I feel like.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   Actually.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   Most people don't.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   Haven't thought about that.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   We could see that.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Or atmosphere.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   Or those types of things.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   So like.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   As far as it goes.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   I don't.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   I don't ever remember that.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   Conversation.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   Not going well.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.040]   I mean.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   It's pretty.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   I don't know.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   Dating.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   You got to think about it.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Be thoughtful about it.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   Be careful about it.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   If you're going to do it.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040]   You know.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   That's okay.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   But hey.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   Let's just do it like.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   In a classy way.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   Where it's not going to be distracting to the rest of the group.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   And then I guess the other thing is like.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   I.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   You know.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   One thing I'm always.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   Trying to inspire college students to do.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   Is to see their campus.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   Christian college students.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   See their campus as a harvest field.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   Um.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   There are so many people who.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   Just need love.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   Lonely.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   You know.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Just.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Full of.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   Uh.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   Stuff that they don't even like or want.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   And just.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   They just need people to love them.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   And so.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   Um.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   Once.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   You know.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   Once people kind of really catch that vision.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.040]   Like.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   Oh.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   Man.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   My campus is a harvest field.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.040]   Um.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   It actually just kind of naturally tends to.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   Like.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   They're interested in meeting people.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   Uh.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   Even during our Bible studies.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   Oh.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   Let me.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   Let me.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   Let me.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   Let me meet that person.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   Like.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040]   Maybe that's someone I can.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   Kind of love and minister.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   You know.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.040]   To.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   Or something like that.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   So.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   I actually find that that kind of.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   Really.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   Like.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   Not.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   Not.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   In order to.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   Interaction.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   In this space.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   Just with.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   My girlfriend.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Because here's a space where I can actually.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   Like.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   Be an older brother to someone.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   And.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   Get to know someone.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   And love someone.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   You know.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   So.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   So.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   Like.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040]   Help with the atmosphere.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Of people caring about each other.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   In that space.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   I like that.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040]   Going back to what you were saying earlier about.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   See.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   You kind of.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   You leave it the ball in their court.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   Whether they want.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   I guess.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   Kind of mentorship.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   In this area.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   If they are dating.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   Some guidance.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   And some mentorship.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   What are some tips.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   That you've given them.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   Or some tools.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   What do you guys do with that.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.040]   Okay.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   Huh.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   Um.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   Dude.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   There are a couple books that I always recommend.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   I think.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.040]   Outdated by.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   Jonathan Pucuta is good.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   It's a good one.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   Um.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   I really like the meaning of marriage.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   By Tim Keller.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   Uh.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   Cause I think it kind of.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   Brings out the goal.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   Like the goal is marriage.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   And here's the kind of marriage you want to.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   Have.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   And if that's the kind of marriage you want to have.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   Then that sort of.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040]   Helps you.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   Determine.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   The kind of dating.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   You want to do.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   And then the kind of people you want to date.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   Um.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   And then like.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   One.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   I guess one just very practical thing.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   That I.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   I tell a lot of people is.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   One of the best ways to.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   Know someone.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   Is.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   To.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   Observe their relationships.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.040]   Um.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   This is too strongly stated.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   And I say it this way sometimes.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   Cause it's slightly controversial.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   But.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040]   Dating is inherently deceptive.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   Um.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   So that's sort of a negative way of putting it.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   But the positive way of putting it.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040]   Is you're always going to put your best foot forward.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   Which is good.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   You want to do that right.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   You're going to dress the best.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   Which you should.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040]   If you don't normally shower.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   You're going to shower.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   You know.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   Like.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   You're going to be on your best behavior.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   And you should.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   But if that's the only thing that you see.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   You're only going to see that other person's sort of.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   Best face.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   If you want to really understand who that person is.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.040]   It's best to see them in context of other relationships.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   How.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   How are they with their friends.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   How are they with people older than them.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   How are they with people younger than them.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   Seeing all of those things.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   Actually gets you.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   A really good picture of what someone's going to be like.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   When you marry them.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Um.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   And so.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   That's like one practical thing.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   I tell people.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.040]   Look out for that.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   That's really interesting because.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   You know.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   Dating today is.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   Seen so often as like a.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   Just one on one kind of thing.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   Or just like.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   That's just a couple.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   Kind of thing.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   And you're kind of expanding that.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   And.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   I find that kind of counter cultural too.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   So.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   It talks about community so much.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   And I think it's so.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   It's so.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   Practical.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   Like.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   You need a village to raise a child.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   You know.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   Like.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   You need.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   Like.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   I don't know how we could have done.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   Marriage.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   Honestly.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   Without all of the relationships that kind of supported us.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   If I.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   If.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   If.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   If.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   Like.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   I was the only source of.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   Like.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   Emotional support for her.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   Or vice versa.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   That's tough.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   Like.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   Who can shoulder that.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   Right.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   And so.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   You kind of need all of those relationships all together.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   That's good.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   Are there any other.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   I don't know.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   Ways in which this issue has come out in your ministry.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.040]   Just other things you try to do.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.040]   Other than like your yearly presentation.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   Or whatever.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   That where you're trying to guard the culture.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   Or.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   Or teach.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   Right.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   Biblical values around this.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   Like.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.040]   Is there anything else that.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   Either tell your staff.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   Or.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   Just anything.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   Anything where it kind of comes in.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   Well.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   One other.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   I guess.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   Piece of advice.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   That we generally advise.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   If they're asking for it.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   Is to.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   Um.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   We encourage them.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   To come up with guardrails.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Around like.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   How late at night.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   Are you going to hang out.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   Um.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   Like.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   How private is the space.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   That you're going to be in together.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   And again.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   This is all with regards to.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   Kind of crossing the.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   The.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040]   The barrier of like.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   Um.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.040]   Having sex before marriage.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   And that's what we're really concerned about.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.040]   More than anything else.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   Really.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   Is purity.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   And so.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   Um.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.040]   We will often advise them.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.040]   To.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   Just come up with.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   What those guardrails are.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.040]   And.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   So you set a guardrail.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.040]   Let's say you go past that.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   That's not sin.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   That's your guardrail.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.040]   What it's supposed to do.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   Is to prick your conscience.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   And cause you.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.040]   To be like.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.040]   Oh.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   Remember we agreed on something.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   Let's not let that slip.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   So that it doesn't.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   It's not that slippery slope.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   That we're going to be sliding down.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   And.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   I think that's something that.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.040]   Um.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   When couples have asked for.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   Mentorship.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   Through their.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   Uh.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   Courting relationship.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   Um.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   We will highly encourage.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   Having those types of things in place.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   Like.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   I.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   So.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   A lot of times I tell people like.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   I'm not against your dating.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   I think dating is great.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   How are you going to get married.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Unless you date.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   Um.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   What I am for.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   Most of all though.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   Is your future marriage.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   Like.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   I want your future marriage to be awesome.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   You so much through that.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   And so let's protect that as best we can.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   And one of the most practical ways to do that.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   Is.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   To avoid sexual sin before you get married.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   Um.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   So that's.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   That's sort of the principle there.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   Man.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   I always.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   There's this quote.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   I think it's C.S. Lewis.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   But I haven't been able to track it down recently.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   But I remember one thing that he says.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   Is.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   Like people always talking about like missing out.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   Like I don't want to miss out.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   Right.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   Um.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.040]   And so.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   Like that's a justification for like.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   Dating around.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   Or kind of doing a lot of things.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   That you know.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   I don't want to miss out on that.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   And he says.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   Well you have to understand that you're making a choice.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   You're either going to miss out on one type of thing or another.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Right.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   So yeah.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   If you.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   If you have premarital sex.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   And you.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   You're not going to miss out on that.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   But what you will miss out on.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   Is the experience of what it's like.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   To be faithful to just one person.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   And you will never know what that's like.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   And you're giving that up.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   So I remember that being very powerful for me.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   Like that really helped me as a young man.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   To kind of think to like.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   Okay.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   God knows best.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   And I don't want to miss out on his best.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   But I'll have to sacrifice that.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   If I.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   You know.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   Take these other things.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   I don't know.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.040]   I just found that helpful.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   If you think it's C.S. Lewis.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   Sounds like the kind of thing he would say.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   But.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   I don't remember the source.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   Um.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   One question I have is like.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   What's.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   What's.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Do you ever get pushback?
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   Do you ever.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   Like what are some questions people ask.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   You know.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   Or like.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   You know.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   Just ways people responded.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   Just.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.040]   On that.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   Cause it just sounds so reasonable.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   You know.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Stuff like that.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   And I.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   I mean.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   I agree with everything you say.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   But.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   You know.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   Well.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   Um.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   I think.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   Well.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   This is actually something that's happening more and more.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.040]   Regularly.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   More than it used to.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   But.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   A lot of people don't even.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   Necessarily agree that.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   A Christian shouldn't date.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   A non-Christian.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   Which I think is.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   I don't know.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   Fairly clear.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   From scripture.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   So.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   Cause you know.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.040]   Again.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   The goal is to get married.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   Right.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040]   So you don't want to get.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   Um.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.040]   So.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   So.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   So.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   Um.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   Who are you to.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   Say anything about my life.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   And.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   And I.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   And I get that.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   I.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   It's.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   It's not.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   It's never easy to invite.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   Someone into your life.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   Especially if there's.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   I mean.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   What.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   What is a more powerful force than attraction?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   That is so powerful.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   So.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   You know.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   What like.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   The number one.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   Biggest.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   Like.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   Concern for college students.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   Is.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   Probably dating.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   What's number two?
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   It's probably dating.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   And then it's like maybe your GPA.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   Right.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   So.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040]   So.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   I get that too.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   So.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   You know.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   Again.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   Um.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   You know.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   For.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   For me.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   It's always permission based.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   Um.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   More often than not.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   I don't know that I've ever like.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Been.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   Like.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   Oh.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   You're wrong.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   Like.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   I don't know that I've ever gotten that kind of response.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.040]   It's more like.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   You know what.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   What you're saying is totally true.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   But we're different.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   That's actually generally.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   Like.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   We're different.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   And so then like.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   At that point.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   Like.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   I have to say.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   You know.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   I've been doing this a long time.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.040]   And.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   It's possible.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.040]   It's possible.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   That you're different.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   You know.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   That I've been doing this a long time.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   And.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040]   It's been a rare.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   If.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.040]   I don't know if I've ever known a situation.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   Where.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040]   People have not crossed those boundaries.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   And regretted it.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   Um.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   But.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   But.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Like.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   It's more along those lines.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   They fully agree with our logic.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   But then it's more like.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040]   Oh.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.040]   But I'm the exception.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   Is often the.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   I see.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   That's interesting.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   Um.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   I imagine that.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   With today.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   You know.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040]   Like.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   Broken families.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   And stuff.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   I feel like.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   Uh.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   Like.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Vision of marriage.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   So you talked about like.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   Uh.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   Meaning of marriage.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   Timothy.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   Talking about the goal.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   And trying to lift up that biblical vision.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   Of what marriage can be.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   Do you find yourself like.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Doing that.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   Or having to do that.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   Just.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   Just cause I feel like.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   I mean a lot of college students.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   Who just.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   They don't have a good vision of marriage.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Estrange from their.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   Whatever.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   And it's just like.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   My.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   My marriage might be the first one they ever seen.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   That's actually intact.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   I mean actually.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   Like.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   When they come to my house for dinner.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   That might be the first family dinner they ever had.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   You know.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   So like.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   What.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   What.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.040]   You know.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040]   Do you guys experience the same thing.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   And what do you do with that.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   Like.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   Are.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   Are.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   Pictures of what a.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.040]   Dating relationship should look like.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   It's like 90% from the media.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040]   Right.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   So.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   And.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   And like.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   How many.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   How many movies.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Or.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   TV shows.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   Do you know of.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   That.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   Portrays.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   A.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   Long-term.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   Loving.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   Marriage.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   It's actually pretty rare.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   Most of the romances are like.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   They're not married yet.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   And it's.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Very.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   Physically based.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   And that's the only.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   Vision that the world has.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   And so.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   Again.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.040]   It totally makes sense that.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   Like.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   That's sort of the cash.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   That's.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   That's what people have in their.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   In their minds.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   So.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   I do think that.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   Like.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   God's ways are better.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   He's not trying to say no.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   He's trying to say there is something better.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   So.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   Kind of.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   Building that out.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   And showing that.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   You know.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   It's hard though.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   It's hard.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Because.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   You know.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   And again.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   I'm gonna.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   I'm gonna.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   Forgo some of this stuff.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   So that I can have that.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   Like.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   That's a difficult.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   Decision.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   All the more.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040]   Than.
