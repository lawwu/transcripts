[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Here's a quick overview of how to use the Project Page workspace.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.600]   We auto-populate line charts for all the metrics you're logging, and you can edit settings
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.280]   on each of those charts individually, or you can use the settings up here to edit them
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.580]   all at once.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.880]   If you put prefixes in your metric names, we'll automatically create sections for you.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.560]   I'm creating a new section and renaming it "Top Graphs."
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.040]   I can drag graphs to that section, or, going to the next page, if I want to move accuracy,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.360]   I can either drag or click the move button and select the destination.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.880]   Now I have a couple of charts that I'd like to resize, and if I click the lower corner
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080]   and drag, both charts will resize at once.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.560]   The second one got sent to the second page here, so I can resize the section, or I can
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.720]   switch to a custom layout.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.960]   That lets me resize each graph individually and organize it exactly how I want it.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.160]   Now I'd like to save this section as a report.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.960]   That gives me a snapshot of the graphs and the run sets, so I can get back to it later.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.620]   Going back to my workspace, I'll show you how to delete and undelete charts.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.080]   I'm clicking delete in the upper right corner, or I can delete the whole section at once.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.440]   To get it back, I go to hidden panels, and I can drag any of these graphs into the sections
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   above to restore them.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.680]   I can also clear my workspace in the lower left-hand corner to reset to my original layout.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.320]   We also have a variety of custom visualizations.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.520]   Here's one of my favorites, the parallel coordinates chart.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.160]   Each line here is a different run, and I can see how hyperparameters affect the output
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.360]   metric, flipping the axis so low loss is at the top.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.400]   I'm going to change the gradient to a different color and click OK to save.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Now that looks a little small in this section.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.020]   I'll create a new section and drag it in, so I can resize it separately.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.160]   I'll switch this section to custom layout, so I can have panels of different sizes, and
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.240]   I'll add a run comparer.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.160]   This lets me see a table of all of my runs and their hyperparameters.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.720]   Last, I'll add a parameter importance panel.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.240]   This panel lets me see how different hyperparameters affect my output metrics.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   I'll switch to accuracy, and it looks like learning rate is pretty important.
