[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   - That's a good point.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.360]   No, no, it's a good point.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Now, some people accuse me of speaking very slowly
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.800]   and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.020]   twice to three times whenever I'm on.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.600]   One of the reasons I speak slowly
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.320]   is because I attach value to every word I say.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.560]   - Normal say this all over and over and over again.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560]   I only deal in facts, I don't deal in hypotheticals.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.260]   I only deal in facts, I only deal in facts.
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.120]   And that seems to be the case,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.520]   to the particular point you're trying to push.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.040]   The idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.640]   any state that had Arabs on it
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.920]   or always had a plan of expulsion
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440]   is just betrayed by the acceptance
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.280]   of the 47 partition plan.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.600]   - I don't think you understand politics.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.920]   - They forced the British to prevent emigration
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.080]   of Jews from Europe and reaching safe shores in Palestine.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.920]   That's what they did.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.740]   - Well, again, was Palestine--
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.880]   - And they knew that the Jews were being persecuted
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.720]   in Europe at the time.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.760]   - Was Palestine the only spot of land on earth?
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400]   - Yes, basically that was the problem.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.800]   The Jews couldn't emigrate anywhere else.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.240]   - What about your great friends in Britain,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.280]   the architects of the Balfour Declaration?
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.780]   - By the late 1930s, they weren't happy to take in Jews
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.880]   and the Americans weren't happy to take in Jews.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.960]   - And why are Palestinians who were not Europeans,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.280]   who had zero role in the rise of Nazism,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.200]   who had no relation to any of this,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400]   why are they somehow uniquely responsible
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.840]   for what happened in Europe and uniquely culpable?
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.640]   - They were helping to close the only safe haven for Jews.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.120]   - Professor Morris, because of your logic,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.040]   and I'm not disputing it, that's why October 7th happened.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.000]   - Oh my God.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   - Because there was no options left for those people.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720]   - The Hamas guys who attacked the kibbutzim,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440]   apart from the attacks on the military sites,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.880]   when they attacked the kibbutzim,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.680]   were out to kill civilians,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.240]   and they killed family after family, house after house.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.400]   - Talk fast, people think that you're coherent.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.600]   - I'm just reading from the UN.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240]   - Yeah, but you see, you got, you got the money.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   - I know you like them sometimes,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.900]   only when they agree with you, though,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.160]   that you've lied about this particular instance in the past.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.760]   Those kids weren't just on the beach
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   as is often stated in articles,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   those kids were literally coming out
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.280]   of a previously identified Hamas compound
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.120]   that they had operated from.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   - Yeah, yeah, Mr. Borelli, Mr. Borelli,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.000]   with all due respect, with all due respect,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   you're such a fantastic moron, it's terrifying.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.680]   - The following is a debate
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.000]   on the topic of Israel and Palestine
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   with Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   Muin Rabbani, and Stephen Bunnell,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.320]   also known online as Destiny.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.480]   Norm and Benny are historians,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.960]   Muin is a Middle East analyst,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.080]   and Stephen is a political commentator and streamer.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.360]   All four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   The goal for this debate was not for anyone to win
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.480]   or to score points.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.360]   It wasn't to get views or likes.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.240]   I never care about those.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.600]   And I think there are probably much easier ways
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.080]   to get those things if I did care.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.920]   The goal was to explore together the history,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.160]   present and future of Israel and Palestine
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   in a free-flowing conversation, no time limits, no rules.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520]   There was a lot of tension in the room
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.920]   from the very beginning,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.000]   and it only got more intense as we went along.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   And I quickly realized that this very conversation
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.920]   in a very real human way was a microcosm
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.320]   of the tensions and distance and perspectives
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.160]   on the topic of Israel and Palestine.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.240]   For some debates, I will step in
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.120]   and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.960]   For this, I saw the value in not interfering
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.800]   with the passion of the exchanges
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.160]   because that emotion in itself spoke volumes.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.080]   We did talk about the history and the future,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.920]   but the anger, the frustration, the biting wit,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.720]   and at times, respect and camaraderie were all there.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Like I said, we did it in a perhaps all too human way.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.520]   I will do more debates and conversations
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.040]   on these difficult topics,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   and I will continue to search for hope
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.120]   in the midst of death and destruction,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.880]   to search for our common humanity
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.920]   in the midst of division and hate.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.960]   This thing we have going on, human civilization,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.280]   the whole of it, is beautiful.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.080]   And it's worth figuring out
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.000]   how we can help it flourish together.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.840]   I love you all.

[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.760]   in the description.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   And now, dear friends, here's Norman Finkelstein,
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.840]   Benny Morris, Moyin Rabbani, and Stephen Bunnell.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.760]   First question is about 1948.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.680]   For Israelis, 1948 is the establishment
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.440]   of the State of Israel and the War of Independence.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.280]   For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   which means catastrophe,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   from their homes as a consequence of the war.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.280]   What to you is important to understand
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   about the events of 1948 and the period around there,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.240]   '47, '49, that helps us understand what's going on today?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.560]   And maybe helps us understand the roots of all of this
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.640]   that started even before 1948?
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.360]   I was hoping that Norm could speak first,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   and Benny, then Moyin, and then Stephen.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000]   Norm?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   - After World War II, the British decided
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.120]   that they didn't want to deal
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   with the Palestine question anymore,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.840]   and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   Now, as I read the record, the UN was not attempting
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.600]   to arbitrate or adjudicate rights and wrongs.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.960]   It was confronting a very practical problem.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.040]   There were two national communities in Palestine,
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.040]   and there were irreconcilable differences
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.640]   on fundamental questions, most importantly,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.960]   looking at the historic record
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.560]   on the question of immigration,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920]   and associated with the question of immigration,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.560]   the question of land.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.640]   The UN Special Committee on Palestine,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   which came into being before the UN 181 Partition Resolution,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.400]   the UN Special Committee recommended
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.720]   two states in Palestine.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.240]   There was a minority position represented
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   by Iran, India, Yugoslavia.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.320]   They supported one state,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   but they believed that if forced to,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.600]   the two communities would figure out
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.720]   some sort of modus vivendi and live together.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.200]   The United Nations General Assembly supported partition
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.600]   between what it called a Jewish state and an Arab state.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.480]   Now, in my reading of the record,
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.920]   and I understand there's new scholarship on the subject,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.560]   which I've not read, but so far as I've read the record,
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.880]   there's no clarity on what the United Nations
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   General Assembly meant by a Jewish state and an Arab state,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.240]   except for the fact that the Jewish state
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   would be demographically, the majority would be Jewish,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.040]   and the Arab state demographically would be Arab.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.320]   The UNSCOP, the UN Special Committee on Palestine,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   it was very clear, and it was reiterated many times,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.560]   that in recommending two states,
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.960]   each state, the Arab state and the Jewish state,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.920]   with regard to political, civil, and religious matters.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.200]   Now, that does raise the question,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   if there is absolute full equality of all citizens,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.560]   both in the Jewish state and the Arab state,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.800]   with regard to political rights,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.320]   civil rights, and religious rights,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.400]   apart from the demographic majority,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   it's very unclear what it meant to call a state Jewish
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.600]   or call the state Arab.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.480]   In my view, the partition resolution
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.400]   was the correct decision.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.280]   I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.080]   could, at that point, be made to live together.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.840]   I disagree with the minority position
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.040]   of India, Iran, and Yugoslavia,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.320]   and that not being a practical option,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.640]   two states, was the only other option.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   In this regard, I would want to pay tribute
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   to what was probably the most moving speech
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.080]   at the UN General Assembly proceedings
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.360]   by the Soviet foreign minister, Gromyko.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.000]   I was very tempted to quote it at length,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   but I recognized that would be taking too much time.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So I asked a young friend, Jamie Stern-Weiner,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.600]   to edit it and just get the essence
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.760]   of what Foreign Minister Gromyko had to say.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.920]   "During the last war," Gromyko said,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   "the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.280]   "and suffering without any exaggeration,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.120]   "this sorrow and suffering are indescribable.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.560]   "Hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.480]   "in various countries of Europe
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.040]   "in search of means of existence and in search of shelter.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.600]   "The United Nations cannot and must not regard
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.320]   "this situation with indifference.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   "Past experience, particularly during the Second World War,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.720]   "shows that no Western European state
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.640]   "was able to provide adequate assistance
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.440]   "for the Jewish people in defending its rights
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.800]   "and its very existence from the violence
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.000]   "of the Hitlerites and their allies.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.920]   "This is an unpleasant fact, but unfortunately,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.200]   "like all other facts, it must be admitted."
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.880]   Gromyko went on to say, "In principle,
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.240]   "he supports one state," or the Soviet Union
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.280]   supports one state, "but," he said,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.000]   "if relations between the Jewish and Arab populations
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.880]   "of Palestine proved to be so bad
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.280]   "that it would be impossible to reconcile them
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.840]   "and to ensure the peaceful coexistence
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.960]   "of the Arabs and the Jews,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.560]   "the Soviet Union would support two states.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:57.720]   "I personally am not convinced
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.200]   "that the two states would have been unsustainable
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   "in the long term if," and this is a big if,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.520]   "the Zionist movement had been faithful
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.040]   "to the position it proclaimed
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.640]   "during the UNSCOP public hearings."
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   At the time, Ben-Gurion testified,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.840]   "I want to express what we mean by a Jewish state.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.040]   "We mean by a Jewish state simply a state
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.600]   "where the majority of the people are Jews,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.280]   "not a state where a Jew has in any way,
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   "any privilege more than anyone else.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   "A Jewish state means a state based on absolute equality
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.160]   "of all her citizens and on democracy.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.680]   "Alas, this was not to be.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.440]   "As Professor Morris has written,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.760]   "quote, Zionist ideology and practice
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   "were necessarily and elementally expansionist."
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.480]   And then he wrote in another book,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   "Transfer," the euphemism for expulsion,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.620]   "Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.320]   "because it sought to transform a land
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.980]   "which was Arab into a Jewish state.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.360]   "And a Jewish state could not have arisen
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.940]   "without a major displacement of Arab population.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:53.820]   "And because this aim automatically produced resistance
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.020]   "among the Arabs, which in turn,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.140]   "persuaded the Yishuv's leaders,"
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.520]   the Yishuv being the Jewish community,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.100]   "the Yishuv's leaders that a hostile Arab majority
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.100]   "or a large minority could not remain in place
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.340]   "if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.660]   "Or as Professor Morris retrospectively put it,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.660]   "quote, a removing of a population was needed.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.020]   "Without a population expulsion,
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.140]   "a Jewish state would not have been established."
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.900]   Unquote.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.120]   "The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution."
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.660]   I won't play games with that.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.740]   I know a lot of people tried to prove it's not true.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.780]   It clearly, in my view, is true.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   "The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.220]   "While Israeli leaders, acting on the compulsions,
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:09.580]   "inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism,

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.180]   "I therefore conclude that neither side
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.080]   "was committed to the letter of the partition resolution
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.160]   "and both sides aborted it."
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   - Thank you, Norm.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.300]   Norm asked that we make a lengthy statement
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.540]   in the beginning.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.500]   Benny, I hope it's okay to call everybody
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.540]   by their first name in the name of camaraderie.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.420]   Norm has quoted several things you said.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.220]   Perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of 1948
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.540]   and maybe respond to the things that Norm said.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.620]   - Yeah, UNSCOP, the United Nations Special Committee
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.420]   on Palestine, recommended partition,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.520]   the majority of UNSCOP, recommended partition,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.580]   which was accepted by the UN General Assembly
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.340]   in November 1947.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.260]   Essentially, looking back to the Peel Commission in 1937,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.700]   10 years earlier, a British commission had looked
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.900]   at the problem of Palestine, the two warring national groups
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.820]   who refused to live together, if you like,
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.820]   or consolidate a unitary state between them.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.760]   And Peel said there should be two states.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.140]   That's the principle.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.500]   The country must be partitioned into two states.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.780]   This would give a modicum of justice to both sides,
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.300]   if not all their demands, of course.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.860]   And the United Nations followed suit.
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.300]   The United Nations, UNSCOP,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.540]   and then the UN General Assembly representing the will
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.820]   of the international community said two states
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.780]   is the just solution in this complex situation.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.580]   The problem was that immediately with the passage
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.700]   of the resolution, the Arab states
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.980]   and the Arabs of Palestine said no,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.900]   as Norman Finkelstein said.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.480]   They said no, they rejected the partition idea,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.780]   the principle of partition, not just the idea
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.060]   of what percentage which side should get,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.820]   but the principle of partition they said no to.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.340]   The Jews should not have any part of Palestine
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.060]   for their sovereign territory.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.740]   Maybe Jews could live as a minority in Palestine.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.500]   That also was problematic in the eyes
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.860]   of the Palestinian Arab leadership.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.820]   Husseini had said only Jews who were there before 1917
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.340]   could actually get citizenship and continue to live there.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.380]   But the Arabs rejected partition,
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.660]   and the Arabs of Palestine launched
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.220]   in very disorganized fashion war against the resolution,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.260]   against the implementation of the resolution,
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.920]   against the Jewish community in Palestine.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.080]   And this was their defeat in that civil war
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.180]   between the two communities while the British
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.780]   were withdrawing from Palestine,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.060]   led to the Arab invasion, the invasion by the Arab states
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.580]   in May 1948 of the country.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.540]   Again, basically with the idea of eradicating
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.280]   or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.420]   in line with the United Nations decision
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.940]   and the will of the international community.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.900]   Norman said that the Zionist enterprise,
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.580]   and he quoted me, meant from the beginning
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.700]   to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.220]   or some of the Arabs of Palestine.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.340]   And I think he's sort of quoting out of context.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.220]   The context in which the statements were made
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.220]   that the Jewish state could only emerge
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.680]   if there was a transfer of Arab population
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.400]   was preceded in the way I wrote it
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.220]   and the way it actually happened
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.380]   by Arab resistance and hostilities
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.580]   towards the Jewish community.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.460]   Had the Arabs accepted partition,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.900]   there would have been a large Arab minority
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.220]   in the Jewish state which emerged in '47.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.460]   And in fact, Jewish economists and state builders
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.340]   took into account that there would be a large Arab minority
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.740]   and its needs would be cared for, et cetera.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.380]   But this was not to be because the Arabs attacked.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.820]   And had they not attacked,
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.940]   perhaps a Jewish state with a large Arab minority
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.580]   could have emerged, but this didn't happen.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.580]   They went to war, the Jews resisted,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.700]   and in the course of that war,
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.580]   Arab populations were driven out.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.420]   Some were expelled, some left because Arab leaders
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.260]   advised them to leave or ordered them to leave.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.340]   And at the end of the war, Israel said they can't return
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.900]   'cause they just tried to destroy the Jewish state.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.260]   And that's the basic reality of what happened in '48.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.660]   The Jews created a state.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.340]   The Palestinian Arabs never bothered
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.400]   to even try to create a state before '48
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.100]   and in the course of the 1948 war.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.480]   And for that reason, they have no state to this day.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.340]   The Jews do have a state 'cause they prepared
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.020]   to establish a state, fought for it,
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   and established it hopefully lastingly.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.860]   - When you say hostility, in case people are not familiar,
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.380]   there was a full-on war where Arab states invaded
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.140]   and Israel won that war.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.140]   - Let me just add to clarify.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.660]   The war had two parts to it.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.740]   The first part was the Arab community in Palestine,
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.740]   its militiamen, attacked the Jews from November 1947.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.220]   In other words, from the day after
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.780]   the UN partition resolution was passed,
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.340]   Arab gunmen were busy shooting up Jews,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.140]   and that snowballed into a full-scale civil war
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.840]   between the two communities in Palestine.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.860]   In May 1948, a second stage began in the war
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.660]   in which the Arab states invaded the new state,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.500]   attacked the new state, and they too were defeated,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.000]   and thus a state of Israel emerged.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.100]   In the course of this two-stage war,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.460]   a vast Palestinian refugee problem occurred.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:15.100]   - And so after that, the transfer, the expulsion,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:20.100]   the thing that people call the Nakba happened.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.980]   William, could you speak to 1948
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.720]   and the historical significance of it?
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.500]   - Sure, there's a lot to unpack here.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   I'll try to limit myself to just a few points.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.420]   Regarding Zionism and transfer,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.140]   I think Chaim Weizmann,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.280]   the head of the World Zionist Organization,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.500]   had it exactly right when he said
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.180]   that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.580]   as Jewish as England is English, or France is French.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   In other words, as Norman explained,
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:05.320]   a Jewish state requires Jewish political,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.440]   demographic, and territorial supremacy.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.840]   Without those three elements,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.720]   the state would be Jewish in name only.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.640]   And I think what distinguishes Zionism
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   is its insistence, supremacy, and exclusivity.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.960]   That would be my first point.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.780]   The second point is I think
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.100]   what the Soviet foreign minister at the time,
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:37.100]   Andrei Gromyko, said is exactly right with one reservation.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:44.060]   Gromyko was describing a European savagery
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.580]   unleashed against Europe's Jews.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.940]   At the time, it wasn't Palestinians or Arabs.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.460]   The savages and the barbarians were European to the core.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.060]   It had nothing to do with developments
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.960]   in Palestine or the Middle East.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.020]   Secondly, at the time that Gromyko was speaking,
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.200]   those Jewish survivors of the Holocaust
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.380]   and others who were in need of safe haven
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.820]   were still overwhelmingly on the European continent
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.500]   and not on Palestine, not in Palestine.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   And I think given the scale of the savagery,
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.580]   I don't think that any one state or country
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.940]   should have borne the responsibility
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.540]   for addressing this crisis.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.120]   I think it should have been an international responsibility.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.500]   The Soviet Union could have contributed.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.980]   Germany certainly could and should have contributed.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   The United Kingdom and the United States,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.420]   which slammed their doors shut
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.220]   to the persecuted Jews of Europe
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.460]   as the Nazis were rising to power,
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.260]   they certainly should have played a role.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.740]   But instead, what passed for the international community
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.460]   at the time decided to partition Palestine.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.940]   And here, I think we need to judge the partition resolution
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.600]   against the realities that obtained at the time.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.980]   2/3 of the population of Palestine was Arab.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.260]   The Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine,
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.700]   constituted about 1/3 of the total population
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   and controlled even less of the land within Palestine
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.780]   as a preeminent Palestinian historian,
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.340]   Walid Al-Khalidi has pointed out.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.340]   The partition resolution in giving roughly 55% of Palestine
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.400]   to the Jewish community and I think 41, 42%
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.540]   to the Arab community, to the Palestinians,
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.560]   did not preserve the position of each community
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   or even favor one community at the expense of the others.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.600]   Rather, it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.360]   the relationship between the two communities.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.200]   And as many have written,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   the Nakba was the inevitable consequence of partition
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.400]   given the nature of Zionism,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.880]   given the territorial disposition,
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.640]   given the weakness of the Palestinian community
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.040]   whose leadership had been largely decimated
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.840]   during a major revolt at the end of the 1930s,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.660]   given that the Arab states were still very much
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.940]   under French and British influence.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.360]   The Nakba was inevitable,
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.360]   the inevitable product of the partition resolution.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   And one last point also about the UN's partition resolution
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.320]   is yes, formally that is what the international community
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.980]   decided on the 29th of November, 1947.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.320]   It's not a resolution that could ever have gotten
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   through the UN General Assembly today
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.120]   for a very simple reason.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.460]   It was a very different General Assembly.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.460]   Most African, most Asian states were not yet independent.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.920]   Were the resolution to be placed
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.640]   before the international community today,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.340]   and I find it telling that the minority opinion
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.280]   was led by India, Iran, and Yugoslavia,
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.900]   I think they would have represented the clear majority.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   So partition, given what we know about Zionism,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.640]   given that it was entirely predictable what would happen,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   given the realities on the ground in Palestine
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.600]   was deeply unjust.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.280]   And the idea that either the Palestinians
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.280]   or the Arab states could have accepted such a resolution
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:21.480]   is, I think, an illusion.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   That was in 1947.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.440]   We saw what happened in '48 and '49.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.660]   Palestinian society was essentially destroyed
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.840]   over 80%, I believe, of Palestinians resident
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.520]   in the territory that became the state of Israel
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   were either expelled or fled,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.900]   and ultimately were ethnically cleansed
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.640]   because ethnic cleansing consists of two components.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.580]   It's not just forcing people into refuge or expelling them.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.160]   It's just, as importantly, preventing their return.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.320]   And here, and Benny Morris has written, I think,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.420]   an article about Yosef Weiz and the transfer committees.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.180]   There was a very detailed initiative to prevent their return
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.520]   and it consisted of raising hundreds
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   of Palestinian villages to the ground,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.440]   which was systematically implemented, and so on.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.800]   And so Palestinians became a stateless people.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.200]   Now, what is the most important reason
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.440]   that no Arab state was established in Palestine?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.260]   Well, since the 1930s, the Zionist leadership
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.260]   and the Hashemite leadership of Jordan,
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.760]   as has been thoroughly researched and written about
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.580]   by the Israeli-British historian Avi Shleim,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.580]   essentially colluded to prevent the establishment
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.760]   of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the late 1940s.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.800]   There's much more here, but I think those are the key points.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.960]   I would make about 1948.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.700]   - We may talk about Zionism, Britain, UN assemblies,
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   and all the things you mentioned, there's a lot to dig into.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.220]   So again, if we can keep it to just one statement
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.060]   moving forward after Stephen, if you wanna go a little longer.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.580]   Also, we should acknowledge the fact
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.960]   that the speaking speeds of people here are different.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.820]   Stephen speaks about 10 times faster than me.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.540]   Stephen, do you want to comment on 1948?
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.260]   - Yeah, I think it's interesting
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.020]   where people choose to start the history.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.260]   I noticed a lot of people like to start at either '47 or '48
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.380]   because it's the first time where they can clearly point
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.160]   to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.580]   that they want to ascribe 100% of the blame
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.960]   to the newly emergent Israeli state to.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.460]   But I feel like when you have this type
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.620]   of reading of history, it feels like the goal
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.580]   is to moralize everything first,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.100]   and then to pick and choose facts
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.400]   that kind of support the statements
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.740]   of your initial moral statement afterwards.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.480]   Whenever people are talking about '48
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.340]   or the establishment of the Arab state,
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.340]   I never hear about the fact that a civil war started in '47.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.480]   That was largely instigated because of the Arab rejectionism
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.600]   of the '47 partition plan.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.620]   I never hear about the fact that the majority
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.320]   of the land that was acquired happened by purchases
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.460]   from Jewish organizations of Palestinian Arabs
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.100]   of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory period
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.260]   in 1920 even started.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.980]   Funnily enough, King Abdullah of Jordan was quoted
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.340]   as saying the Arabs are as prodigal in selling their land
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.220]   as they are in weeping about it.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.620]   I never hear about the multiple times
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.380]   that Arabs rejected partition, rejected living with Jews,
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.440]   rejected any sort of state that would have even had
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.860]   any sort of Jewish exclusivity.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.700]   It's funny because it was brought up before
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.140]   that the partition plan was unfair,
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.620]   and that's why the Arabs rejected it,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.820]   as though they rejected it because it was unfair,
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.340]   because of the amount of land that Jews were given,
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.460]   and not just due to the fact that Jews were given land
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.360]   at all, as though a 30% partition or a 25% partition
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.020]   would have been accepted when I don't think
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.380]   that was the reality of the circumstances.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.900]   I feel like most of the other stuff has been said,
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.740]   but I noticed that whenever people talk about '48
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.660]   or the years preceding '48, I think the worst thing
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.260]   that happens is there's a cherry picking of the facts
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.420]   where basically all of the blame is ascribed
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.900]   to this built-in idea of Zionism
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.380]   that because of a handful of quotes
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.260]   or because of an ideology, we can say that transfer
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.780]   or population expulsion or basically the mandate
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.380]   of all of these Arabs being kicked off the land
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.960]   was always going to happen when I think there's a refusal
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.180]   sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.840]   of the ideas of some of the Zionist leaders,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.460]   there is a political, social, and military reality
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.380]   on the ground that they're forced to contend with.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.960]   And unfortunately, the Arabs, because of their inability
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.940]   to engage in diplomacy and only to use tools of war
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.460]   to try to negotiate everything going on
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.080]   in mandatory Palestine, basically always gave the Jews
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.060]   a reason or an excuse to fight
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.740]   and acquire land through that way
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.780]   because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.860]   whether it was the partition plan in '47,
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.700]   whether it was the Lusanne Peace Conference afterwards
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.700]   where Israel even offered to annex Gaza in '51
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.940]   where they offered to take in 100,000 refugees.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.780]   Every single deal is just rejected out of hand
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.300]   because the Arabs don't want a Jewish state
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.060]   anywhere in this region of the world.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.780]   - I would like to engage Professor Morris.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.660]   If you don't mind, I'm not with the first name.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.540]   It's just not my way of relating.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.760]   - You can just call me Morris.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.680]   You don't need the professor.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.520]   - Okay.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.700]   (laughing)
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.820]   There's a real problem here.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.320]   And it's been the problem I've had over many years
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.700]   of reading your work, apart perhaps from as grandchild,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.120]   I suspect nobody knows your work better than I do.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.280]   I've read it many times, not once, not twice,
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.680]   at least three times, everything you've written.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.740]   And the problem is it's a kind of quicksilver.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.740]   It's very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:58.380]   So we're gonna try here to see
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.340]   whether we can hold you to a point.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.520]   And then you argue with me the point.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.920]   I have no problem with that.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.700]   Your name, please?
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.680]   - Stephen Bunnell.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.520]   - Okay.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.720]   Mr. Bunnell referred to cherry picking
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.500]   and handful of quotes.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   Now, it's true that when you wrote your first book
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.420]   on the Palestinian refugee question,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.840]   you only had a few lines on this issue of transfer.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.320]   - Four pages.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.160]   - In the first book.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.000]   - In the first book, four pages.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.120]   - Maybe four, I'm not gonna quarrel.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.680]   My memory is not clear.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.240]   We're talking about 40 years ago.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.960]   I read it, I read it, but then I read other things by you.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.080]   Okay.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   And you were taken to task, if my memory is correct,
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.320]   that you hadn't adequately documented
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.720]   the claims of transfer.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.480]   Allow me to finish.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.640]   And I thought that was a reasonable challenge
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.460]   because it was an unusual claim
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.960]   for a mainstream Israeli historian to say,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.240]   as you did in that first book,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.080]   that from the very beginning,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.480]   transfer figured prominently in Zionist thinking.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.840]   That was an unusual, if you read Anita Shapira,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.680]   you read Shabtai Tevitt,
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.880]   that was an unusual acknowledgement by you.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   And then I found it very impressive
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.960]   that in that revised version of your first book,
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.800]   you devoted 25 pages
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.400]   to copiously documenting
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.360]   the salience of transfer
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.700]   in Zionist thinking.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.700]   And in fact, you used a very provocative
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.400]   and resonant phrase.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   You said that transfer was inevitable
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.680]   and inbuilt into Zionism.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.400]   We're not talking about circumstantial factors,
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.000]   a war, Arab hostility.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You said it's inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.640]   Now, as I said, so we won't be accused of cherry picking,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.200]   those were 25 very densely argued pages.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.200]   And then in an interview,
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.820]   and I could cite several quotes, but I'll choose one.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.820]   You said, "Removing a population was needed."
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.100]   Let's look at the words.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.160]   "Without a population expulsion,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:01.080]   "a Jewish state would not have been established."
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.520]   Now, you're the one, again,
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.460]   I was very surprised when I read your book.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.500]   Here I'm referring to Righteous Victims.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.960]   I was very surprised when I came to that page 37,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.820]   where you wrote that territorial displacement
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.980]   and dispossession was the chief motor
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.240]   of Arab resistance to Zionism.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.100]   Territorial displacement and dispossession
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.900]   were the chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.560]   So you then went on to say,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   "Because the Arab population rationally feared
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.280]   "territorial displacement and dispossession,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.800]   "it of course opposed Zionism."
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.620]   That's as normal as Native Americans
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:05.100]   opposing the Euro-American manifest destiny
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.220]   in the history of our own country,
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.060]   because they understood it would be at their expense.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.140]   It was inbuilt and inevitable.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.260]   And so now for you to come along and say
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.420]   that it all happened just because of the war,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:28.900]   that otherwise the Zionists made all these plans
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.280]   for a happy minority to live there,
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.300]   that simply does not gel.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.340]   It does not cohere.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.860]   It is not reconcilable
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.660]   with what you yourself have written.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.660]   It was inevitable and inbuilt.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.580]   Now, in other situations you've said that's true,
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.780]   but I think it was a greater good
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.460]   to establish a Jewish state
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.060]   at the expense of the indigenous population.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.660]   That's another kind of argument.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.060]   That was Theodore Roosevelt's argument in our own country.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.460]   He said, "We don't want the whole of North America
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   "to remain a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teepees.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:17.900]   "We have to get rid of them and make this a great country."
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:23.860]   But he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   - I think you've made your point.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.820]   First, I'll take up something that Muin said.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.100]   He said that the Nakba was inevitable.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.660]   - As have you. - And predictable.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.700]   No, no, no, I've never said that.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.140]   It was inevitable and predictable
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.860]   only because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.820]   and state in 1947, '48.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.300]   Had there been no assault,
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.660]   there probably wouldn't have been a refugee problem.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.700]   There's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred,
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.420]   expulsions to have occurred,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.500]   a dispossession, massive dispossession to occur.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.780]   These occurred as a result of war.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.140]   Now, Norman has said that,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.420]   I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.780]   in one way or another.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.260]   And this is certainly true.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.020]   In order to buy land,
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.300]   they had the Jews bought tracts of land
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.740]   on which some Arabs sometimes lived.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.460]   Sometimes they bought tracts of land
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.060]   on which there weren't Arab villages,
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.900]   but sometimes they bought land on which there were Arabs.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.300]   And according to Ottoman law and the British,
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.980]   at least in the initial years of the British mandate,
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.100]   the law said that the people who bought the land
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.140]   could do what they liked
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.900]   with the people who didn't own the land,
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.020]   who were basically squatting on the land,
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.780]   which is the Arab tenant farmers,
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.980]   which is, we're talking about a very small number, actually,
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.620]   of Arabs who were displaced
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.780]   as a result of land purchases
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.820]   in the Ottoman period or the mandate period.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.980]   But there was dispossession in one way.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.300]   They didn't possess the land, they didn't own it,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.940]   but they were removed from the land.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.740]   And this did happen in Zionism.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.140]   And there's, if you like,
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.860]   an inevitability in Zionist ideology
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.700]   of buying tracts of land
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.580]   and starting to work it yourself
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.020]   and settle it with your own people and so on.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.060]   That made sense.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.660]   But what we're really talking about
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.020]   is what happened in 47, 48.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.020]   And in 47, 48, the Arabs started a war.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.660]   And actually, people pay for their mistakes.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.340]   And the Palestinians have never actually agreed
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.540]   to pay for their mistakes.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.700]   They make mistakes.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.620]   They attack.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.820]   They suffer as a result.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.180]   And we see something similar going on today
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.860]   in the Gaza Strip.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.020]   They do something terrible.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.740]   They kill 1,200 Jews.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.980]   They abduct 250 women and children and babies
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.180]   and old people and whatever.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.820]   And then they start screaming,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.020]   "Please save us from what we did
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.540]   "because the Jews are counterattacking."
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.900]   And this is what happened then.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.220]   And this is what's happening now.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.180]   There's something fairly similar in the situation here.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.340]   Expulsion, and this is important.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.980]   Norman, you should pay attention to this.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.260]   You didn't raise that.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.300]   Expulsion, transfer were never policy
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.980]   of the Zionist movement before 47.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.540]   It doesn't exist in Zionist platforms
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.500]   of the various political parties,
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.700]   of the Zionist organization,
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.420]   of the Israeli state, of the Jewish agency.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.220]   Nobody would have actually made it into policy
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.020]   because it was always a large minority.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.540]   If there were people who wanted it,
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.980]   always a large minority of Jewish politicians and leaders
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.780]   would have said, "No, this is immoral.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.780]   "We cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion."
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.900]   So it was never adopted,
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.220]   and actually was never adopted as policy even in 48,
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.700]   even though Ben-Gurion wanted as few Arabs
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.460]   in the course of the war staying in the Jewish state
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.700]   after they attacked it.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.460]   He didn't want disloyal citizens staying there
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.540]   'cause they wouldn't have been loyal citizens.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.660]   But this made sense in the war itself.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.940]   But the movement itself and its political parties
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.340]   never accepted it.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.700]   It's true that in 1937,
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.500]   when the British as part of the proposal
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.460]   by the Peel Commission to divide the country
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.540]   into two states, one Arab, one Jewish,
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.820]   which the Arabs of course rejected,
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.500]   Peel also recommended that the Arabs,
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.660]   most of the Arabs in the Jewish state to be
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.140]   should be transferred
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.820]   because otherwise if they stayed
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.860]   and were disloyal to the emergent Jewish state,
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.380]   this would cause endless disturbances,
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.340]   warfare, killing, and so on.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.820]   So Ben-Gurion and Weizmann latched onto this proposal
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.660]   by the most famous democracy in the world,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.220]   the British democracy,
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.900]   when they proposed the idea of transfer
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.940]   side by side with the idea of partition
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.100]   'cause it made sense.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.100]   And they said, "Well, if the British say so,
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.820]   "we should also advocate it."
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.940]   But they never actually tried to pass it
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.700]   as Zionist policy.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.060]   And they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.260]   after 1938.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.860]   - So just to clarify,
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.860]   what you're saying is that '47 was an offensive war,
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.380]   not a defensive war.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.300]   - By the Arabs, yes.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.140]   - By the Arabs?
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.980]   - Yeah.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.620]   - And you're also saying that there was never
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.540]   a top-down policy of expulsion.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.380]   - Yes.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.460]   - Just to clarify the point.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.740]   - If I understood you correctly,
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:20.180]   you're making the claim that transfer, expulsion,
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.820]   and so on was, in fact, a very localized phenomenon
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.580]   resulting from individual land purchases.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.420]   And that, if I understand you correctly,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.980]   you're also making the claim that the idea
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   that a Jewish state requires a removal
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:48.220]   or overwhelming reduction of the non-Jewish population was--
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.380]   - If the Arabs are attacking you, yes.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.940]   - But let's say prior to 1947,
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.620]   it would be your claim that the idea
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.140]   that a significant reduction or wholesale removal
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.900]   of the Arab population was not part of Zionist thinking.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.260]   Well, I think there's two problems with that.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.700]   I think what you're saying about localized disputes
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   is correct, but I also think that there is a whole literature
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:28.140]   that demonstrates that transfer was envisioned
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.540]   by Zionist leaders on a much broader scale
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.300]   than simply individual land purchases.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.060]   In other words, it went way beyond,
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.740]   we need to remove these tenants
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.820]   so that we can farm this land.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.020]   The idea was we can't have a state
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.820]   where all these Arabs remain,
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.220]   and we have to get rid of them.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.300]   And the second, I think, impediment to that view
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.960]   is that long before the UN General Assembly convened
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.340]   to address the question of Palestine,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.620]   Palestinian and Arab, and other leaders as well,
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   had been warning ad infinitum
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.860]   that the purpose of the Zionist movement
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.460]   is not just to establish a Jewish state,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.740]   but to establish an exclusivist Jewish state,
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.300]   and that transfer, forced displacement,
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.620]   was fundamental to that project.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.140]   And just responding to, sorry, was it?
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.300]   - Yeah, Stephen.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.900]   - Bonnell or Donnell? - Or Bonnell, yeah.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.980]   - With a B. - Yeah.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:33.820]   - Yeah.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:39.660]   You made the point that the problem here
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.180]   is that people don't recognize
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.240]   is that the first and last result for the Arabs
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.940]   is always war.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.380]   I think there's a problem with that.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.860]   I think you might do well to recall
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.760]   the 1936 general strike conducted by Palestinians
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.380]   at the beginning of the revolt,
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:03.060]   which at the time was the longest recorded
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.740]   general strike in history.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:10.020]   You may want to consult the book published last year
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.040]   by Laurie Allen, A History of False Hope,
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.020]   which discusses in great detail
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.740]   the consistent engagement by Palestinians,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.780]   their leaders, their elites, their diplomats, and so on,
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.580]   with all these international committees.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.620]   If we look at today, the Palestinians are once again
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.240]   going to the International Court of Justice.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.940]   They're consistently trying to persuade
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.740]   the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.260]   to do his job.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.500]   They have launched widespread boycott campaigns.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.980]   So, of course, the Palestinians
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:53.180]   have engaged in military resistance.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.140]   But I think the suggestion that this has always been
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.980]   their first and last resort,
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   and that they have somehow spurned civic action,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   spurned diplomacy, I think really has no basis in reality.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.220]   - I'll respond to that, and then a question for Norm
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.760]   to take into account, I think, when he answers Benny,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.600]   'cause I am curious.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.060]   Obviously, I have fresher eyes on this,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.780]   and I'm a newcomer to this arena
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.260]   versus the three of you guys, for sure.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.820]   A claim that gets brought up a lot
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.260]   has to do with the inevitability of transfer in Zionism,
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.660]   or the idea that as soon as the Jews
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.360]   envisioned a state in Palestine,
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.860]   they knew that it would involve
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.980]   some mass transfer of population,
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.980]   perhaps a mass expulsion.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.220]   I'm sure we'll talk about Plan Dalit
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.100]   or Plan D at some point.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.380]   The issue that I run into is,
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.980]   while you can find quotes from leaders,
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.980]   while you can find maybe desires expressed in diaries,
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.220]   I feel like it's hard to truly ever know
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.680]   if there would have been mass transfer
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.140]   in the face of Arab peace,
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.460]   because I feel like every time
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.360]   there was a huge deal on the table
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.060]   that would have had a sizable Jewish
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.440]   and Arab population living together,
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.580]   the Arabs would reject it out of hand.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.620]   So, for instance, when we say that transfer was inevitable,
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.500]   when we say that Zionists would have never accepted
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.060]   a sizable Arab population,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.040]   how do you explain the acceptance of the '47 Partition Plan
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.080]   that would have had a huge Arab population
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.460]   living in the Jewish state?
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.860]   Is your contention that after the acceptance of that,
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.300]   after the establishment of that state,
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.460]   that Jews would have slowly started to expel
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.220]   all of these Arab citizens from their country?
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.980]   Or how do you explain that in Lusan, a couple years later,
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.340]   that Israel was willing to formally annex the Gaza Strip
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.060]   and make 200,000 or so people those citizens?
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.960]   But I'm just curious, how do we get this idea
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.420]   of Zionism always means mass transfer
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.540]   when there were times, at least early on
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.780]   in the history of Israel and a little bit before it,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.980]   where Israel would have accepted a state
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.200]   that would have had a massive Arab population in it?
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.440]   Is your, yeah, is your idea
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.220]   that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards,
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.060]   or?
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.460]   - Is that a question to me or Norm?
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.300]   - Either one, I'm just curious
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.660]   for the incorporation of the answer, yeah.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.740]   - There's some misunderstandings here.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.540]   So let's try to clarify that.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:03.940]   Number one, it was the old historians
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.020]   who would point to the fact,
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.460]   in Professor Morris's terminology,
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.580]   the old historians, what he called not real historians,
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.920]   he called them chroniclers, not real historians.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.900]   It was the old Israeli historians
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:22.900]   who denied the centrality of transfer in Zionist thinking.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:28.720]   It was then Professor Morris,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.740]   who, contrary to Israel's historian establishment,
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.660]   who said, now you remind me it's four pages,
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.380]   but it came at the end of the book, it was--
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.140]   - No, no, it's at the beginning of the book.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.980]   - Transfer.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.280]   - Transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.080]   of my first book on the Palestinian refugee problem.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.560]   - It's a fault of my memory, but the point still stands.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.440]   It was Professor Morris who introduced this idea
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.360]   in what you might call a big way.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.920]   - Yeah, but I didn't say it was central to the Zionist--
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.480]   - Okay, allow me, okay, allow me--
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.920]   - You're saying centrality.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.960]   I never said it was centrality, I said it was their idea.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.920]   - By the way, it's okay to respond back and forth,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.760]   this is great.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.460]   And also, just a quick question, if I may.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.980]   You're using quotes from Benny, from Professor Morris.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.500]   It's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.340]   the full context of the--
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.180]   - That would be fine.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.540]   - So if we go back to quotes we've said in the past,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.660]   and you both here have written,
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.580]   the three of you have written on this topic a lot,
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.140]   is we should be careful and just admit like,
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:34.980]   well, yeah, well, that's--
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.580]   - Just real quick, just to be clear,
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.020]   the contention is that Norm is quoting a part
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.660]   and saying that this was the entire reason
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.480]   for this, whereas Benny's saying it's a part of the--
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.160]   - I'm not quoting a part.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:51.180]   I'm quoting 25 pages where Professor Morris
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:56.280]   was at great pains to document the claim
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   that appeared in those early four pages of his book.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   Now, you say it never became part
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   of the official Zionist platform.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.220]   - Never became part of policy.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.060]   - Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, okay.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.000]   We're also asked, well, if this is true,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.760]   why did that happen, why did that happen?
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.040]   It's because, it's a very simple fact
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.680]   which everybody understands.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.940]   Ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:32.120]   There are real world practical problems.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:36.860]   You can't just take an ideology and superimpose it
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:41.400]   on a political reality and turn it into a fact.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.660]   It was the British mandate.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:50.060]   There was significant Arab resistance to Zionism
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:56.140]   and that resistance was based on the fact, as you said,
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.780]   the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.020]   So you couldn't very well expect the Zionist movement
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.420]   to come out in neon lights and announce,
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.460]   "Hey, we're going to be expelling you
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.780]   "the first chance we get."
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.360]   That's not realistic.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.100]   Now, okay. - Let me respond.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.300]   Look, you've said it a number of times
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   that the Arabs, from fairly early on in the conflict
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:29.420]   from the 1890s or the early 1900s said,
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.320]   "The Jews intend to expel us."
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.860]   This doesn't mean that it's true.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.320]   It means that some Arabs said this,
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.700]   maybe believing it was true,
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.740]   maybe using it as a political instrument
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.180]   to gain support to mobilize Arabs
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.060]   against the Zionist experiment.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:47.700]   But the fact is transfer did not occur before 1947.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:52.540]   And Arabs later said, and since then,
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.080]   have said that the Jews want to build a third temple
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.580]   on the Temple Mount, as if that's what really
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.580]   the mainstream of Zionism has always wanted
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.020]   and always strived for.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.940]   But this is nonsense.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.100]   It's something that Husseini used to use
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.260]   as a way to mobilize masses for the cause,
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.780]   using religion as the way to get them to join him.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:19.420]   The fact that Arabs said that the Zionists
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.820]   wanted to dispossess us doesn't mean it's true.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.580]   It just means that some Arabs thought that,
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.140]   maybe said it sincerely and maybe insincerely.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.620]   - Professor Morris.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.020]   - Later, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.420]   This is true, because the Arabs attacked the Jews.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.540]   - Professor Morris, I read through your stuff.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.940]   Even yesterday, I was looking through "Righteous Victim."
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.900]   - You should read other things, you're wasting your time.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.580]   - No, no, actually, no.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.540]   I do read other things, but I don't consider it
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.760]   a waste of time to read you, not at all.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:57.300]   You say that this wasn't inherent
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.660]   in Zionism.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.140]   Now, would you agree that David Ben-Gurion was a Zionist?
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.180]   - A major Zionist leader.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.460]   - Would you agree Chaim Weizmann was a Zionist?
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.620]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.080]   I believe they were.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.940]   I believe they took their ideology seriously.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.380]   It was the first generation.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.860]   Just like with the Bolsheviks,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   the first generation was committed to an idea.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.740]   By the 1930s, it was just pure Realpolitik.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.220]   The ideology went out the window.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.460]   The first generation, I have no doubt
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.740]   about their convictions, okay?
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.040]   They were Zionists.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.580]   Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt in Zionism.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.620]   - You keep repeating the same thing.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.500]   - Yeah, because I have, as I said then, Mr. Morris,
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.380]   I have a problem reconciling what you're saying.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.380]   It either was incidental or it was deeply entrenched.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.460]   Here, I read it's deeply entrenched.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   Two very resonant words, inevitable and inbuilt.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.380]   - Deeply entrenched, I never wrote that.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.340]   - Well, I'm not sure.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.620]   - It's something you just invented.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.140]   - Okay, inevitable and inbuilt.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.540]   - The idea, let me concede something.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.340]   The idea of transfer was there.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.380]   Israel Zangvil, a British Zionist,
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.740]   talked about it early on in the century.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.780]   Even Herzl, in some way,
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.060]   talked about transferring population.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.460]   - According to your 25 pages, everybody talked about it.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.420]   - We keep bringing up this line
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.220]   in the 25 pages and the four pages.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:38.860]   We're lucky to have Benny in front of us right now.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:41.380]   We don't need to go to the quotes.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:46.380]   We can legitimately ask how central is expulsion to Zionism
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.560]   in its early version of Zionism
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.380]   and whatever Zionism is today,
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:58.380]   and how much power, influence does Zionism and ideology
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:03.060]   have in Israel and influence the philosophy,
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.540]   the ideology of Zionism have on Israel today.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.660]   - The Zionist movement up to 1948,
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.860]   Zionist ideology was central
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.420]   to the whole Zionist experience,
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.340]   the whole enterprise up to 1948.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.500]   And I think Zionist ideology was also important
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   in the first decades of Israel's existence.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.300]   Slowly, the hold of Zionism,
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.940]   like, if you like, like Bolshevism,
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.140]   held the Soviet Union, gradually faded.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.760]   And a lot of Israelis today think
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.860]   in terms of individual success and then the capitalism
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.220]   and all sorts of things
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.940]   which are nothing to do with the Zionism.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.900]   But Zionism was very important.
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.920]   But what I'm saying is that the idea of transfer
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.820]   wasn't the core of Zionism.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.620]   The idea of Zionism was to save the Jews
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.960]   who had been vastly persecuted in Eastern Europe
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.220]   and incidentally in the Arab world,
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.180]   the Muslim world for centuries,
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.540]   and eventually ending up with the Holocaust.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.140]   The idea of Zionism was to save the Jewish people
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.940]   by establishing a state or reestablishing a Jewish state
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.280]   on the ancient Jewish homeland,
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.700]   which is something the Arabs today even deny
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   that there were Jews in Palestine or the land of Israel.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.800]   2,000 years ago, Arafat famously said,
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.760]   "What temple was there on Temple Mount?"
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   Maybe it was in Nablus, which of course is nonsense.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.200]   But they had a strong connection
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.080]   for thousands of years to the land
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.480]   to which they wanted to return and returned there.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.600]   They found that on the land
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.560]   lived hundreds of thousands of Arabs.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.800]   And the question was how to accommodate
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.320]   the vision of a Jewish state in Palestine
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.700]   alongside the existence of these Arab masses
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.820]   living on, who were indigenous in fact,
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.340]   to the land by that stage.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.780]   And the idea of partition,
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.140]   because they couldn't live together
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.260]   because the Arabs didn't want to live together
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.100]   with the Jews.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.540]   And I think the Jews also didn't want to live together
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.820]   in one state with Arabs in general.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.980]   The idea of partition was the thing
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.620]   which the Zionists accepted.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.900]   Okay, we can only get a small part of Palestine.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.260]   The Arabs will get in '37, most of Palestine.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.420]   In 1947, the ratios were changed,
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.440]   but we can live side by side with each other
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.940]   in a partitioned Palestine.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.660]   And this was the essence of it.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.300]   The idea of transfer was there,
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.060]   but it was never adopted as policy.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.140]   But in 1947, '48, the Arabs attacked
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.620]   trying to destroy essentially the Jewish,
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.540]   the Zionist enterprise and the emerging Jewish state.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:45.420]   And the reaction was a transfer in some way.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.500]   Not as policy, but this is what happened on the battlefield.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.320]   And this is also what Ben-Gurion at some point
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.520]   began to want as well.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   - Well, one of the first books on this issue I read
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.180]   when I was still in high school,
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.840]   because my late father had it,
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.540]   was the diaries of Theodor Herzl.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.000]   And I think Theodor Herzl, of course,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.800]   was the founder of the contemporary Zionist movement.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.640]   And I think if you read that, it's very clear.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.460]   For Herzl, the model upon which the Zionist movement
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.720]   would proceed, his model was Cecil Rhodes.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.740]   I think Rhodes, from what I recall,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.000]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.640]   has quite a prominent place in Herzl's diaries.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.320]   I think Herzl was also corresponding with him
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.880]   and seeking his support.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   Cecil Rhodes, of course, was the British colonialist
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.820]   after whom the former white minority regime
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:54.280]   in Rhodesia was named.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:59.000]   And Herzl also says explicitly in his diaries
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   that it is essential to remove the existing population
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.560]   from Palestine.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.000]   - Can I respond to this?
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.840]   - In a moment, please.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.680]   He says we shall have to spirit the penniless population
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.200]   across the borders and procure employment
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.760]   for them elsewhere or something.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.040]   And Israel Zangwill, who you mentioned,
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.960]   a land without a people for a people without a land.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.120]   They knew damn well it wasn't a people,
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.240]   a land without a people.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   I'll continue, but please, go ahead.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.120]   - Just to this, there is one small diary entry
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.560]   in Herzl's vast-- - It's five volumes.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.920]   - Yeah, five volumes, there's one paragraph
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.320]   which actually mentions the idea of transfer.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.280]   There are people who I think that Herzl
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.520]   was actually pointing to South America
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.720]   when he was talking about that.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.040]   The Jews were going to move to Argentina
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.720]   and then they would try and buy out or buy off
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.960]   or spirit the penniless natives
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.720]   to make way for Jewish settlement.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.800]   Maybe he wasn't even talking about the Arabs
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.320]   in that particular passage.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.960]   That's the argument of some people.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   Maybe he was, but the point is it has only 1/100th of a,
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.680]   1% of the diary which is devoted to this subject.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.440]   It's not a central idea-- - Well, I'll defer.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.120]   - In Herzl's thinking.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.200]   What Herzl wanted, and this is what's important,
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.040]   not Rhodes, I don't think he was the model.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.720]   Herzl wanted to create a liberal, democratic,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.320]   Western state in Palestine for the Jews.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.640]   That was the idea, not some imperial enterprise
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.560]   serving some imperial master, which is what Rhodes was about,
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.280]   but to have a Jewish state which was modeled
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.000]   on the Western democracies in Palestine.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.920]   And this incidentally was more or less what Weizmann
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.600]   and Ben-Gurion, Ben-Gurion was more of a socialist,
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.400]   Weizmann was more of a liberal Westerner,
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.960]   but they wanted to establish a social democratic
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.640]   or liberal state in Palestine.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.720]   And they both envisioned through most of the years
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.120]   of their activity that there would be an Arab minority
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.280]   in that Jewish state.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.040]   It's true that Ben-Gurion strived to have as small
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.900]   as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish state
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.880]   because he knew that if you want a Jewish majority state,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.120]   that would be necessary, but it's not something
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.080]   which they were willing to translate into actual policy.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.200]   - Just a quick pause to mention that for people
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.780]   who are not familiar, Theodor Herzl we're talking about
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.440]   over a century ago, and everything we've been talking
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.600]   about has been mostly 1948 and before.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.520]   - Yes, just one clarification on Herzl's diaries.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.720]   I mean, the other thing that I recall from those diaries
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.160]   is he was very preoccupied with, in fact,
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.880]   getting great power patronage, seeing Palestine,
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.200]   the Jewish state in Palestine, I think his words,
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.740]   an outpost of civilization against barbarism.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.120]   In other words, very much seeing his project
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.560]   as a proxy for Western imperialism in the Middle East.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.280]   - No, no, I don't think that's the right word, not proxy.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.000]   He wanted to establish a Jewish state
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.440]   which would be independent.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.560]   To get that, he hoped that he would be able
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.760]   to garner support from major imperial powers.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.540]   - Including the Ottoman Sultan, who he tried to cultivate.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.000]   I just want to respond to a point you made earlier,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.660]   which was that people expressed their rejection
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.580]   of the partition resolution on the grounds
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.180]   that it gave the majority of Palestine
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.460]   to the Jewish community, which formed only a third.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.340]   Whereas, in fact, if I understood you correctly,
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.880]   you're saying the Palestinians and the Arabs
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.500]   would have rejected any partition resolution.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.140]   - Yeah, a couple things.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.460]   That one, they would have rejected any.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.060]   Two, a lot of that land given was in the Negev.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.220]   It was pretty terrible land at the time.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.940]   And then three, the land that would have been partitioned
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.660]   to Jews, I think would have been,
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.780]   I think I saw it was like 500,000,
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.900]   it would have been 500,000 Jews, 400,000 Arabs,
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.860]   and I think like 80,000 Bedouin would have been there.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.660]   So the state would have been divided pretty closely.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.100]   - I think you raise a valid point.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.520]   Because I think the Palestinians did reject
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.020]   the partition of their homeland, in principle.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.700]   And I think the fact that the United Nations
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.460]   General Assembly then awarded the majority
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.820]   of their homeland to the Zionist movement
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.960]   only added insult to injury.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.700]   I mean, one doesn't have to sympathize
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:32.100]   with the Palestinians to recognize
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.620]   that they have now been a stateless people for 75 years.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.180]   Can you name any country, yours, for example,
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.340]   or yours, that would be prepared to give 55%,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   25%, 10% of your country to the Palestinians?
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.760]   Of course not.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   And so the issue was not the existence of Jews in Palestine.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.140]   They had been there for centuries.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:03.880]   And of course they had ties to Palestine,
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.820]   and particularly to Jerusalem and other places,
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.140]   going back centuries, if not millennia.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:15.260]   But the idea of establishing an exclusively Jewish state
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.980]   at the expense of those who are already living there,
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.140]   I think it was right to reject that.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.780]   And I don't think we can look back now,
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.980]   75 years later, and say, "Well, you should have accepted
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.820]   "losing 55% of your homeland because you ended up
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.360]   "losing 78% of it, and the remaining 22%
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.740]   "was occupied in 1967."
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.940]   That's not how things work.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.940]   And I can imagine an American rejecting,
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:51.580]   giving 10% of the United States to the Palestinians,
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.260]   and if that rejection leads to war
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.180]   and you lose half your country,
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.500]   I doubt that 50 years from now you're going to say,
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.900]   "Well, maybe I should have accepted that."
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.100]   - Sure, so I like this answer more
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.020]   than what I usually feel like I'm hearing
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.900]   when it comes to the Palestinian rejection
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.540]   of the 47 Partition Plan.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.660]   'Cause sometimes I feel like a weird switch happens
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.380]   to where the Arabs in the area are actually presented
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.220]   as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.140]   a calculation and saying, "Well, we're losing 55%
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.960]   "of our land, Jews are only maybe 1/3 of the people here,
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.220]   "and we've got 45," and nah, the math doesn't work,
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.480]   basically, but it wasn't a math problem.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.320]   I think, like you said--
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.300]   - It was a matter of principle.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.340]   - It was an ideology problem.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   - No, it was a matter of principle.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.940]   - Yeah, ideologically driven, that they, as a people,
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.240]   have a right to, or are entitled to, this land
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.180]   that they've never actually had an independent state on,
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.580]   that they've never had even a guarantee
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.420]   of an independent state on,
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.940]   that they've never actually ruled a government of their own.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.700]   - That last point is actually not correct,
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.600]   because for all its injustice,
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.780]   the mandate system recognized Palestine
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.860]   as a Class A mandate, which provisionally recognized
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.820]   the independence of that territory.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.300]   - Of what would emerge from that territory,
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.140]   but not of the Palestinians.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.020]   - It was provisionally recognized.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.900]   - But the territory itself was,
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.420]   but not of the Palestinian people to have a right
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.260]   or a guarantee to a government that would emerge from it.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.540]   - Well, it was a British mandate of Palestine,
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.220]   not the British mandate of Israel.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.300]   - The word exclusive, which you keep using, is nonsense.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.540]   The state which Ben-Gurion envisioned
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.660]   would be a Jewish-majority state,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.160]   as they accepted the 1947 partition resolution,
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.580]   as Stephen said, that included 400,000-plus Arabs
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.260]   in a state which would have 500,000 Jews.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.800]   So the idea of exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air at all
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.740]   among the Zionist leaders in '47, '48.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   They wanted a Jewish-majority state,
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.180]   but were willing to accept a state which had 40% Arabs.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.140]   That's one point.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:50.500]   The second thing is the Palestinians may have regarded
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.480]   the land of Palestine as their homeland,
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.700]   but so did the Jews.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.780]   It was the homeland of the Jews as well.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.620]   The problem was the Arabs were unable and remain,
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.260]   to this day, unable to recognize that for the Jews,
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.900]   that is their homeland as well.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.840]   And the problem then is how do you share this homeland?
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.220]   Either with one binational state,
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.340]   or partitioned into two states.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.620]   The problem is that the Arabs have always rejected
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.220]   both of these ideas.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.340]   The homeland belongs to the Jews, as Jews feel,
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.820]   as much as it does, if not more, than for the Arabs.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.780]   I would say for the Jews.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.460]   It's the Jewish people's homeland.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.100]   - Real quick, I just want, for both of you guys,
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.220]   'cause I haven't heard these questions answered,
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.700]   I really want these questions to be,
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.020]   I'm just so curious how to make sense of them.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.620]   It was correctly brought up that I believe
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.100]   that Ben-Gurion had, I think Shlomo Ben-Amin
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.140]   describes it as an obsession with getting validation
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.380]   or support from Western states.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   Great Britain, and then a couple decades later--
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.180]   - That explains the Suez War, the Suez Crisis.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.680]   - Yeah, exactly, correct.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.980]   That was one of the major motivators,
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.960]   the idea to work with Britain and France
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.140]   on a military operation against Arabs.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.220]   - Imperial stooge.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.780]   - But then the question, again, I go back to,
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.700]   if that is true, if Ben-Gurion,
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.940]   if the early Israel saw themselves
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.140]   as a Western-fashioned nation,
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.660]   how could we possibly imagine
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.140]   that they would have engaged in the transfer
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.660]   of some 400,000 Arabs after accepting the partition plan?
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.860]   Would that not have completely and totally destroyed
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire Western world?
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.800]   Would there not have been, how not?
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.480]   - Well, first of all, I think that
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.460]   the Zionist leadership's acceptance
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.940]   of the partition resolution,
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.760]   and I think you may have written about this,
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.660]   that they accepted it because it provided
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:34.220]   international endorsement of the legitimacy
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.580]   of the principle of Jewish statehood,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.100]   and they didn't accept the borders,
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.500]   and in fact later expanded the borders.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.340]   Second of all--
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.300]   - No, they didn't accept the borders.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.580]   The borders were expanded at war.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.180]   - They accepted the UN partition resolution,
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.020]   borders and all.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:50.420]   That's how they accepted it.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.320]   You can say that some of the Zionists,
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.620]   deep in their hearts, had the idea
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.460]   that maybe at some point--
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.760]   - Including their most--
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:57.600]   - They would be able to get more.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.760]   - Including their most senior leaders who said so,
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.320]   and I think you've quoted them saying so.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.800]   - But they grudgingly accepted what the United Nations,
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.440]   the world community, had said,
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.600]   this is what you're going to get.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.360]   - And second of all, I mean, removing dark people,
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   darker people, it's intrinsic.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.200]   It's intrinsic.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.640]   - In Israel, Jews are as dark as Arabs.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.720]   - It's intrinsic to Western history,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.340]   so the idea that Americans or Brits or the French
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.640]   would have an issue with, I mean,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.200]   the French had been doing it in Algeria for decades.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.360]   The Americans have been doing it
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.840]   in North America for centuries,
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.840]   so how would Israel forcibly displacing Palestinians
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.700]   somehow besmirch Israel in the eyes of the West?
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:45.080]   - In the 1944 resolution of the Labor Party,
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.680]   and at the time, even Bertrand Russell
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.960]   was a member of the Labor Party,
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.980]   it endorsed transfer of Arabs out of Palestine
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.920]   as Moines pointed out.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.600]   That was a deeply entrenched idea in Western thinking
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.760]   that there was nothing, it doesn't in any way
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.680]   contradict or violate or breach any moral values
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.600]   to displace the Palestinian population.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.500]   Now, I do believe there's a legitimate question.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:20.200]   Had it been the case, as you said, Professor Morris,
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.220]   that the Zionists wanted to create a happy state
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:29.220]   with a Jewish majority, but a large Jewish minority,
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.720]   and if by virtue of immigration, like in our own country,
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.780]   in our own country, given the current trajectories,
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:40.660]   non-whites will become the majority population
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.700]   in the United States quite soon,
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.780]   and according to democratic principles,
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.780]   we have to accept that.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.620]   So if that were the case,
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.320]   I would say maybe there's an argument
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.740]   that had there been mass Jewish immigration,
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.500]   change the demographic balance in Palestine,
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:05.500]   and therefore Jews became the majority,
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.300]   it can make an argument in the abstract
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.740]   that the indigenous Arab population
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.980]   should have been accepting of that,
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.900]   just as whites in the United States,
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.260]   quote-unquote whites, have to be accepting of the fact
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.420]   that the demographic majority is shifting
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.560]   to non-whites in our own country.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.820]   But that's not what Zionism was about.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.860]   I did write my doctoral dissertation on Zionism,
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.780]   and I don't want to get now bogged down in abstract ideas,
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:39.340]   but as I suspect you know, most theorists of nationalism
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.860]   say there are two kinds of nationalism.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:45.860]   One is a nationalism based on citizenship.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.500]   You become a citizen, you're integral to the country.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.540]   That's sometimes called political nationalism.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.040]   And then there's another kind of nationalism,
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   and that says the state should not belong to its citizens,
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.100]   it should belong to an ethnic group.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:09.100]   Each ethnic group should have its own state.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.020]   It's usually called the German Romantic idea of nationalism.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:19.020]   Zionism is squarely in the German Romantic idea.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:24.700]   That was the whole point of Zionism.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.100]   We don't want to be Bundists
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:32.060]   and be one more ethnic minority in Russia.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.460]   We don't want to become citizens
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:39.460]   and just become a Jewish people in Russia.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:44.460]   In England, or France, we want our own state.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:49.700]   - Like the Arab 23 states.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.660]   - No, wait, before we get to the Arabs,
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.180]   let's stick to the Jews for a moment, or the Zionists.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:58.580]   We want our own state.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   And in that concept of wanting your own state,
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:10.180]   the minority, at best, lives on sufferance,
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:15.500]   and at worst, gets expelled.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.420]   That's the logic of the German Romantic
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.440]   Zionist idea of a state.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.700]   That's why they're Zionists.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.860]   Now, I personally have shied away
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.740]   from using the word Zionism
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.300]   ever since I finished my doctoral dissertation.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.540]   - Was that painful?
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.780]   - Because, as I said, I don't believe
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.700]   it's the operative ideology today.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.900]   It's like talking about Bolshevism
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.780]   and referring to Khrushchev.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.780]   I doubt Khrushchev could have spelled Bolshevik.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.820]   But for the period we're talking about,
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:59.980]   they were Zionists.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.100]   They were committed to their exclusive state
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:08.100]   with a minority living on sufferance,
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.080]   or, at worst, expelled.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.260]   That was their ideology.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.520]   And I really feel there's a problem
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.520]   with your happy vision of these Western Democrats
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.220]   like Weizmann, and they wanted to live
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.220]   peacefully with the Arabs.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.460]   Weizmann described the expulsion in 1948
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:34.980]   as, quote, "the miraculous clearing of the land."
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.040]   That doesn't sound like somebody shedding
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.040]   too many tears at the loss of the indigenous population.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.380]   - Let me just respond to the word
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.940]   of one of our respondents.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.580]   - The unsufferance, I don't agree with.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.740]   I think that's wrong.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.940]   The Jewish state came into being in 1948.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:53.780]   It had a population which was 20% Arab
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.060]   when it came into being, after Arab refugees,
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.420]   many of them had become refugees,
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.680]   but 20% remained in the country.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   20% of Israel's population at inception in 1949 was Arab.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.000]   - 80% went missing.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.140]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.980]   I was talking about what remained in Palestine, Israel,
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.240]   after it was created.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.880]   The 20% who lived in Israel received citizenship
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.220]   and all the rights of Israelis,
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.220]   except, of course, the right to serve in the army,
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.140]   which they didn't want to.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.900]   And they have Supreme Court justices.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.400]   They have Knesset members.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.240]   They enjoyed basically--
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.660]   - I think they lived under emergency laws until 1966.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.500]   - For a period, sure.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.340]   They lived under a--
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.220]   - So they didn't immediately have citizenship.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.060]   - No, no, no, wait a second.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.980]   At the beginning-- - This is just fantasy.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.260]   - At the beginning, it's not fantasy.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.180]   At the beginning, they received citizenship,
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.600]   could vote in elections for their own people,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.220]   and they were put into parliament.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.240]   But in the first years, the Israeli, the Jewish majority,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.740]   suspected that maybe the Arabs would be disloyal
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.580]   'cause they had just tried to destroy the Jewish state.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.900]   Then they dropped the military government
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.260]   and they became fully equal citizens.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.880]   So if the whole idea was they must have a state
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.780]   without Arabs, this didn't happen in '49.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.920]   - Then why-- - And it didn't happen
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.820]   in the subsequent decades. - Then why did you say,
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.120]   Professor Morris? - Yes.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.940]   - Then why did you say without a population expulsion,
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.300]   a Jewish state would not have been established?
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.620]   - Because you're missing the first section
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.180]   of that paragraph, which was they were being assaulted
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.700]   by the Arabs, and as a result,
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.780]   a Jewish state could not have come into being
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.820]   unless there had also been an expulsion of the population
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:35.660]   which was trying to kill the Arabs.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.500]   - Norm, I'm officially forbidding you referencing that.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.980]   Again, we've responded-- - I think--
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.620]   - Hold on a second, wait.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.540]   We've responded to it, so the main point you're making,
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.220]   we'll have to take Benyetta's word,
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.020]   is there was a war,
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.460]   and that's the reason why he made that statement.
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.980]   I think just one last point on this.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.620]   I remember reading your book when it first came out,
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:04.060]   and reading one incident after the other,
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.700]   and one example after the other,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.220]   and then getting to the conclusion where you said
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:13.300]   the Nakba was a product of war, not design.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.340]   I think we were, and I remember reacting almost
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:21.060]   in shock to that, that I felt you had mobilized
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.420]   overwhelming evidence that it was a product
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.020]   of design, not war, and I think our discussion today
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:33.020]   very much reflects, let's say, the dissonance
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.940]   between the evidence and the conclusion.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.940]   You don't feel that the research
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:43.060]   that you have conducted and published
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.580]   demonstrates that it was in fact inherent
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.100]   and inbuilt and inevitable,
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.260]   and I think the point that Norm and I are making
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:56.220]   is that your own historical research,
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.740]   together with that of others,
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.100]   indisputably demonstrates that it does.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.900]   I think that's a fundamental disagreement
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.980]   we're having here.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.500]   - Can I, well, yeah, can I actually respond to that,
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.220]   'cause this is actually, I think this is emblematic
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.260]   of the entire conversation.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.500]   I watched a lot of Norm's interviews
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.260]   and conversations in preparation for this,
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.140]   and I hear Norm will say this over and over and over again.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.100]   I only deal in facts.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.140]   I don't deal in hypotheticals.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.060]   I only deal in facts.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.700]   I only deal in facts, and that seems to be the case,
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.980]   except for when the facts are completely
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.860]   and totally contrary to the particular point
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.100]   you're trying to push.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.620]   The idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.180]   any state that had Arabs on it
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.500]   or always had a plan of expulsion
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.020]   is just betrayed by the acceptance
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.860]   of the '47 partition plan.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.660]   - I don't think you understand politics.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.820]   Did I just say that there is a chasm
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.220]   that separates your ideology
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.700]   from the limits and constraints
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   imposed by politics and reality?
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:58.260]   Now, Professor Morris, I suspect would agree
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.460]   that the Zionist movement from fairly early on
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.780]   was committed to the idea of a Jewish state.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.860]   I am aware of only one major study
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.420]   probably written 40 years ago,
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.180]   the "Binational Idea in Mandatory Palestine"
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.020]   by a woman, I forgot her name now.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.700]   You remember her.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.540]   - I'm trying to.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.700]   - Yeah, okay, but you know the book.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:23.540]   - I think so.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:28.180]   - Yeah, she is the only one who tried to persuasively argue
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:33.180]   that the Zionist movement was actually, not formally,
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:37.340]   actually committed to the binational idea.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:41.860]   But most historians of the subject agree
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.580]   the Zionist movement was committed
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.260]   to the idea of a Jewish state.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.420]   Having written my doctoral dissertation on the topic,
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.020]   I was confirmed in that idea because Professor Chomsky,
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.820]   who was my closest friend for about 40 years,
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.940]   was very committed to the idea
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.180]   that binationalism was the dominant trend in Zionism.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.220]   I could not agree with, I couldn't go with him there.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.700]   But Professor Morris, you are aware
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.940]   that until the Biltmore Resolution in 1942,
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.660]   the Zionist movement never declared
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.740]   it was for a Jewish state.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.580]   Why?
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:24.100]   Because it was politically impossible
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.540]   at the moment until 1942.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.900]   There is your ideology, there are your convictions,
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.780]   there are your operative plans,
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:37.780]   and there's also separately what you say in public.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.380]   The Zionist movement couldn't say in public,
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.260]   "We're expelling all the Arabs."
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.860]   They can't say that.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.620]   And they couldn't even say,
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:51.060]   "We support a Jewish state until 1942."
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.340]   - You're conflating two things.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.700]   The Zionists wanted a Jewish state, correct?
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.260]   That didn't mean expulsion of the Arabs.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.340]   It's not the same thing.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.860]   They wanted a Jewish state with a Jewish majority,
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.540]   but they were willing, as it turned out,
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:08.780]   both in '37 and in '47, and subsequently,
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.780]   to have an Arab minority, a large Arab minority.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.780]   They were willing to have a large Arab minority
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.220]   in the country, and they ended up
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.820]   with a large Arab minority in the country.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:24.180]   20% of the population in '49 was Arab,
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.020]   and it still is 21%.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.780]   - They ended up for about five minutes
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.420]   before they were expelled.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.980]   They agreed to it until '47,
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.140]   and then they were gone by March 1949.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.700]   - What happened in between the rejection
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:38.300]   of the partition plan and the expulsion of the Arabs?
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.660]   - The Arabs launched the war.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.860]   - Well, yeah, I mean, it wasn't random.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:42.700]   There's a potential that-
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.140]   - I agree, it wasn't random.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.700]   I totally agree with that.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:46.940]   It was by design.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.500]   It wasn't random. - You can say that,
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.020]   but in this case, the facts betray you.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.180]   There was no Arab acceptance of anything
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.220]   that would have allowed for a Jewish state to exist.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.060]   - Of course not. - Number one.
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.380]   And number two, I think that it's entirely possible,
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.780]   given how things happen after war,
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.820]   that this exact same conflict could have played out,
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.180]   and an expulsion would have happened
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.840]   without any ideology at play,
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.580]   that there was a people that disagreed
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.500]   on who had territorial rights to a land,
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.660]   there was a massive war afterwards,
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.820]   and then a bunch of their friends invaded after
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.140]   to reinforce the idea that the Jewish people,
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.460]   in this case, couldn't have a state.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.340]   There could have been a transfer regardless.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.740]   - Anything could have been,
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.980]   but that's not what history is about.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.100]   - History is about Palestinian rejectionism
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.300]   to any peace deal over and over and over again.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:32.020]   - As I said, when the war was thrown into the court
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.020]   of the United Nations,
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.780]   they were faced with a practical problem.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.780]   And I, for one, am not going to try to adjudicate
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.980]   the rights and wrongs from the beginning.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:50.980]   I do not believe that if territorial displacement
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.780]   and dispossession was inherent in the Zionist project,
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   I do not believe it can be a legitimate political enterprise.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.940]   Now, you might say that's speaking from 2022 or 2020.
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.340]   Where are we now? - Four now, I think.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.060]   - Okay, but we have to recognize
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.880]   that from nearly the beginning,
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.740]   for perfectly obvious reasons,
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.820]   having nothing to do with anti-Semitism,
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.700]   anti-Westernism, anti-Europeanism,
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.380]   but because no people that I am aware of
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.380]   would voluntarily cede its country.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.820]   - Except for all the people that sold land voluntarily.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.060]   - You can perfectly understand
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.940]   Native American resistance to Eurocolonialism.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.260]   You can perfectly well understand it
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:54.260]   without any anti-Europeanism, anti-whitism, anti-Christianism.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.940]   They didn't want to cede their country to invaders.
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.220]   - I think you're-- - That's completely
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.100]   understandable. - You're minimizing
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:05.380]   the anti-Semitic element-- - You minimized it.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.260]   - In Arab nationalism. - In all your books,
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.580]   you minimized it. - No, no, no.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.460]   Husseini was an anti-Semite.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.440]   The leader of the Palestinian National Movement
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.140]   in the '30s and '40s was an anti-Semite.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.940]   This was one of the things which drove him
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.660]   and also drove him in the end to work in Berlin
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:25.980]   for Hitler for four years, giving Nazi propaganda
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.060]   to the Arab world, calling on the Arabs to murder the Jews.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.660]   That's what he did in World War II.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.000]   That's the leader of the Palestinian Arab National Movement.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.420]   - Why is it-- - And he wasn't alone.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:37.740]   He wasn't alone. - Professor, why is it
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.860]   that if you read your book, Righteous Victims,
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.240]   you can read it and read it and read it and read it,
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.540]   as I have, you will find barely a word
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.300]   about the Arabs being motivated by anti-Semitism.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.140]   - It exists, though. - I didn't say
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.780]   it doesn't exist. - You agree that it exists.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.980]   - Hey, I don't know a single non-Jew
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.180]   who doesn't harbor anti-Semitic sentiment.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:03.020]   - We're talking about Arabs now.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.020]   - Yeah, but I don't know anybody
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:08.380]   that's just part of the human condition.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.100]   - Anti-Semitism. - Yes, I do.
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.300]   - Husseini was a-- - And among the Arabs.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.060]   - So, Professor Mars, here's my problem.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:19.420]   I didn't see that in your Righteous Victims.
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.620]   Even when you talked about the first intifada
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.220]   and you talked about the second intifada
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.020]   and you talked about how there was a lot of influence
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:31.620]   by Hamas, the Islamic movement,
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.980]   you even stated that there was a lot of anti-Semitism
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:38.300]   in those movements, but then you went on to say,
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.300]   but of course, at bottom, it was about the occupation.
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:47.020]   It wasn't about, and I've read it.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.340]   - Yeah, but you're moving from different--
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:49.740]   - No, I'm not moving. - Ages, across the ages.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:52.260]   - I'm talking about your whole book.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.700]   - The occupation began in '67,
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.660]   the one you're talking about.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.540]   - I looked and looked and looked for evidence
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:02.740]   of this anti-Semitism as being a chief motor
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:05.820]   of Arab resistance to Zionism.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.660]   I didn't see it.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.180]   - You like the-- - Did he make that claim?
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.580]   - I don't remember the word chief.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.300]   - Yeah. - It's one of the elements.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.780]   - I'm very binary thinking when it comes to--
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.460]   - Binary? - Yeah, it's binary.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:18.500]   - Please, don't give me this post-modernism binary.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.060]   You're the one-- - No, but you are thinking
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:20.900]   in terms of black and white. - You're the one
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.100]   that said the chief motor. - No, Stephen has a point.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.100]   - Do you have your book here? - You do talk about black--
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.740]   - Page 137. - You talk in black
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:27.940]   and white-- - To page 37.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.260]   - You're talking in black and white concepts
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.860]   when history is much grayer.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.340]   Lots of things happen because of lots of reasons,
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:38.220]   not one or the other, and you don't seem to see that.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.060]   - Can I ask you a question?
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:39.900]   'Cause it's for them to talk to.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.980]   Just a very quick question.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.460]   What was, what do you think the ideal solution was
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.260]   on the Arab side from '47?
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.460]   What would they have preferred?
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:47.700]   And what would have happened-- - Well, they were explicit.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.060]   - And then the second one, what would have happened
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.220]   if Jews would have lost the war in '48?
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.060]   What do you think would have happened
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.620]   to the Israeli population or Jewish population?
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:58.620]   - I think the Palestinians and the Arabs were explicit
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:03.860]   that they wanted a unitary, I think, federal state,
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:09.140]   and they made their submissions to UNSCOP.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:12.900]   They made their appeals at the UN General Assembly.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.460]   - What do you mean by unitary and federal?
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.220]   I don't get that.
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.500]   They wanted an Arab state.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.380]   They wanted Palestine to be an Arab state.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.220]   - Yes, yes.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.060]   - Put it simply.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.580]   Without the word unitary, federal,
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:26.180]   they wanted Palestine as an Arab and exclusively Arab state.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.940]   - No, it wasn't an exclusively Arab state.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.180]   I think we have to distinguish between Palestinian
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.500]   and Arab opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   on the one hand, and Palestinian and Arab attitudes
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:44.700]   to Jewish existence in Palestine.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:45.540]   There's a fundamental difference.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.740]   - Well, Husseini, the leader of the movement,
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:51.380]   said that all the Jews who had come since 1917,
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:55.740]   and that's the majority of the Jews in Palestine in 1947,
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:56.580]   shouldn't be there.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.420]   - Well, he did say--
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.340]   - They shouldn't be citizens, and they shouldn't be there.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.180]   - He did say that.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:01.020]   - The PLO tried to say that in '64.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.180]   I'm not going to deny it.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.500]   Of course, it's true.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.420]   I can understand the sentiment, but I think it's wrong.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:08.300]   - But also, you guys are the ones--
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.420]   - I agree on this, and I also--
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.260]   - I want to answer your question.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.740]   - You guys are like, 'cause you had used the words earlier
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.580]   that it was supremacy and exclusivity
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.420]   that the Zionist state was built on.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.580]   - Well, I want to answer your question.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:19.740]   Husseini did say that, and I'm sure there was
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:24.620]   a very substantial body of Palestinian-Arab public opinion
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:28.700]   that endorsed that, but by the same token,
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:33.700]   I think a unitary Arab state, as you call it,
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:38.240]   or a Palestinian state, could have been established
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.780]   with arrangements, with guarantees,
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:46.580]   to ensure the security and rights of both communities.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:51.580]   How that would work in detail had been discussed
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:54.780]   and proposed, but never resolved.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:59.780]   And again, I think Jewish fears about what would have--
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.300]   - A second Holocaust, that's what--
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.140]   - Well, no, I think--
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:04.740]   - That was the Jewish fear, a second Holocaust.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.900]   - That may well have been the Jewish fear.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.360]   - It was an unfounded Jewish fear.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.280]   - It was unfounded?
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280]   - Of course it was unfounded.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.280]   - What about like in '48 and '56?
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.960]   - You really think that the Palestinians,
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.520]   had they won the war, were going to import ovens
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.360]   and crematoria from Germany?
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.200]   - I don't know if it would have been that bad,
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.720]   but there were pogroms across,
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.720]   in almost every single Arab state
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.200]   where there were Jews living, after '48,
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.980]   after '56, after '67, there were always pogroms,
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.440]   there were always flights from Jews
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.920]   from those countries to Israel afterwards.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.760]   I don't think it would be--
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.920]   - I wouldn't say there were always pogroms
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.920]   in every Arab state.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.920]   I think there was flight of Arab Jews
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.440]   for multiple reasons, in some cases,
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.600]   for precisely the reasons you say.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.880]   If you look at the Jewish community in Algeria,
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.760]   for example, their flight had virtually nothing
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.360]   to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.640]   The issue of Algerian Jews was that
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.900]   the French gave them citizenship
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.480]   during their colonial rule of Algeria,
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.320]   and they increasingly became identified
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:10.040]   with French rule, and when Algeria became independent
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:15.040]   and all the French ended up leaving
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.440]   out of fear or out of disappointment
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.160]   or out of whatever, the Jews were identified
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.880]   as French rather than Algerian.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.340]   - This is a bit of a red herring.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.680]   There were pogroms in the Arab countries,
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.120]   in Bahrain even, where there's almost no Jews.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.540]   There was a pogrom in 1947.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:34.000]   There was a pogrom in Aleppo in 1947.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.840]   - I'm not denying any of that history.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:38.600]   - There were killings of Jews in Iraq and Egypt
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.520]   in 1948, '49.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.360]   - I'm not denying any--
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.720]   - So the Jews basically fled the Arab states,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.320]   not for multiple reasons.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.840]   They fled because they felt that the governments there
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.960]   and the societies amid which they had lived
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.200]   for hundreds of years no longer wanted them.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.400]   - Look, without getting into the details,
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.640]   I think we can both agree that ultimately
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:03.260]   a clear majority of Arab Jews who believed
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:06.780]   that after having lived in these countries for--
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:09.820]   - Way before the Arabs, way before the Arabs arrived there.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:14.820]   - For centuries, if not millennia,
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:17.540]   came to the unfortunate conclusion
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.760]   that their situation had become untenable.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.180]   - Yes.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:25.040]   - I also think that we can both agree
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.940]   that this had never been an issue prior to Zionism
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.860]   and the emergence of the State of Israel.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.700]   Look, I'm not--
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.100]   - Pogroms didn't begin with Zionism in the Arab world.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.980]   - The issue is the point I raised,
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:40.860]   which is whether these communities had ever come
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:44.520]   to a collective conclusion that their position
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.980]   had become untenable in this part of the world.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.180]   No, they were Arab Jews.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.260]   - Well, because untenable meant there was no alternative,
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.700]   but with the creation of Israel,
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:52.940]   there was an alternative, right?
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:55.340]   A place where they could go and not be discriminated against
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.600]   or live as second-class citizens
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.340]   or be subject to Arab-majority states.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.540]   I also think it's interesting
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:03.460]   that when you analyze the flight of Jewish people,
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:06.060]   and I've seen this, it wasn't just, I agree with you,
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.120]   it wasn't just a mass expulsion from all the Arab states.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.300]   There were definitely push factors.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.940]   There were also pull factors.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:12.500]   Now, I don't know how you guys feel about the Nakba,
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.380]   but when the analysis of the Nakba comes in,
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.540]   again, it's back to that,
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.940]   well, that was actually just a top-down expulsion.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:22.600]   The retreat of wealthy Arab people in the '30s didn't matter.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.440]   Any of the messaging
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.660]   from the surrounding Arab states didn't matter.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:27.860]   It was just an expulsion from Jewish people
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:31.520]   or people running from their lives from Jewish massacres.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.200]   Again, I feel like it's that selective,
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.040]   it's a selective critical analysis of the-
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:34.860]   - Again, I'm a little uncomfortable
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.840]   always using the term Jewish here,
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.640]   because it wasn't the Jews of England or the Soviet Jews.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.960]   - Well, I say Jewish because prior to '48,
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.040]   it's saying Israeli, the Yishuv, I guess, or whatever.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:48.000]   - I think we should, I think it's useful to say,
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.280]   refer to Zionists before 1948 and Israelis after '48.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.520]   We don't need to implicate Jews elsewhere.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.980]   - Sure, but the Jewish people
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.500]   that were being attacked in Arab states weren't Zionists,
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.340]   they were just Jews living there, right?
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.400]   - Okay, allow me to just comment on that.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   I was rereading Shlomo Ben-Ami's last book,
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:08.100]   and he does, at the end, discuss at some length
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.140]   the whole issue of the refugee question
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.620]   bearing on the so-called peace process.
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:16.380]   And on the question of '48 and the Arab emigration,
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:19.140]   if you'll allow me, let me just quote him.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:22.060]   "Israel is particularly fond
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:26.260]   "of the awkwardly false symmetry she makes
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.560]   "between the Palestinian refugee crisis
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.880]   "and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.940]   "from Arab countries following the creation
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.420]   "of the state of Israel, as if it were, quote,
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:43.720]   "an unplanned exchange of populations," unquote.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.280]   And then Mr. Ben-Ami, for those of you who are listening,
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.320]   he was Israel's former foreign minister,
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   and he's an influential historian in his own right.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.860]   He says, "In fact, envoys from the Mossad
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.700]   "and the Jewish agency worked underground
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:05.160]   "in Arab countries and Iran
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.700]   "to encourage Jews to go to Israel.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:13.360]   "More importantly, for many Jews in Arab states,
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.040]   "the very possibility of emigrating to Israel
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.620]   "was the culmination of millennial aspirations.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:24.960]   "It represented the consummation of a dream
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.800]   "to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation."
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:34.800]   So this idea that they were all expelled after 1948,
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.000]   that's one area, Professor Morris, I defer to expertise.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.560]   That's one of my credos in life.
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.440]   I don't know the Israeli literature,
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.400]   but as it's been translated in English,
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.040]   there's very little solid scholarship
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.560]   on what happened in 1948 in the Arab countries
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.300]   and which caused the Jews to leave.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.280]   - Arab Jews.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.480]   - The Arab Jews, right.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:04.560]   But Shlomo Ben-Ami knows the literature.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.500]   He knows the scholarship.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.340]   He knows the history. - He also comes
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.160]   from the Tangiers.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.200]   - Yeah, so-- - He's from Morocco.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.040]   - Right, so he knows--
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.640]   - Avi Shleim from Iraq has written on this issue as well.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.920]   - And they wrote that the Jews in the Arab lands
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.640]   were not pro-Zionist.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.040]   They weren't Zionists at all.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.800]   Certainly, Avi Shleim's family was anti-Zionist.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.680]   - And Avi Shleim, when he was interviewed
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.320]   by Merrin Rappaport on this question, he said,
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:27.680]   "You simply cannot say that the Iraqi Jews were expelled.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.240]   "It's just not true."
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.240]   And he was speaking as an Iraqi Jew
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.000]   who left with his father and family in 1948.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.840]   - They were pushed out.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.320]   They weren't expelled.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.880]   That's probably the right phrase.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:39.720]   - I think it's-- - They were pushed out.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.440]   - I think it's more complex than that.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.600]   I think it was, sorry, I interrupted you.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.560]   - No, you're not interrupting me 'cause I don't know.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.600]   I only know what's been translated into English
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.780]   and the English literature on the subject
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:56.240]   is very small and not scholarly.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.280]   Now, there may be a Hebrew literature, I don't know,
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.200]   but I was surprised that even Shlomo Ben-Ami,
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.200]   a stoward of his state, fair enough,
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:10.520]   on this particular point, he called it false symmetry.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.560]   - No, no, Stephen is right.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.920]   There was a pull and a push mechanism
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.820]   in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post '48,
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.240]   but there was also a lot of push, a lot of push.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.680]   - That's indisputable.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:22.520]   There was push.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.040]   And on the point of agreement,
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.120]   on this one brief light of agreement,
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.120]   let us wrap up with this topic of history
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.520]   and move on to modern day, but before that,
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.800]   I'm wondering if we could just say
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.240]   a couple of last words on this topic, Stephen.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.400]   - Yeah, I think that when you look at the behaviors
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   of both parties in the time period around '48,
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.880]   or especially '48 and earlier,
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:51.960]   there's this assumption that there was
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.240]   this huge built-in mechanism of Zionism
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.960]   and that it was going to be inevitable
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.960]   from the inception of the first Zionist thought,
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.600]   I guess, that appeared in Herzl's mind
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.640]   that there would be a mass violent population transfer
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.640]   of Arab Palestinians out of
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.920]   what would become the Israeli state.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.640]   I understand that there are some quotes that we can find
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.360]   that maybe seem to possibly support an idea
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.580]   that looks close to that,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.280]   but I think when you actually consult the record
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.120]   of what happened, when you look at the populations,
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.640]   the massive populations that Israel was willing to accept
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.840]   within what would become their state borders,
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.080]   their nation borders,
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.480]   I just don't think that the historical record agrees
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.240]   with the idea that Zionists would have just never been okay
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.860]   living alongside Arab Palestinians.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.120]   But when you look at the other side,
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.240]   Arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.760]   that apportioned any amount of that land
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.140]   for any state relating to Jewish people
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.600]   or the Israeli people.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.120]   I think it was said even on the other end of the table
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.840]   that Arab Palestinians would have never accepted,
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.760]   the Arabs would have never accepted
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.480]   any Jewish state whatsoever.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.420]   So it's interesting that on the ideology part
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:58.000]   where it's claimed that Zionists are people of exclusion
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.320]   and supremacy and expulsion,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.720]   we can find that in diary entries,
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.200]   but we can find that expressed in very real terms
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.200]   on the Arab side,
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.960]   I think in all of their behavior around 48 and earlier,
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.840]   where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli state.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.760]   It would have been the dispossession of many Jewish people.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.840]   It probably would have been the expulsion
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.460]   of a lot of them back to Europe.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:16.940]   And I think that very clearly plays out
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.440]   in the difference between the actions of the Arabs
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.720]   versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.720]   - Benny?
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.360]   - Well, one thing which stood out
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.440]   and I think Muin made this point
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.000]   is that the Arabs had nothing to do with the Holocaust,
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.400]   but then the world community forced the Arabs
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.480]   to pay the price for the Holocaust.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.200]   That's the traditional Arab argument.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.720]   This is slightly distorting the reality.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.520]   The Arabs in the 1930s did their utmost
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.560]   to prevent Jewish immigration from Europe
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.240]   and reaching Palestine,
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.200]   which was the only safe haven available
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.080]   'cause America, Britain, France,
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.320]   nobody wanted Jews anywhere
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.840]   and they were being persecuted in central Europe
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.880]   and eventually would be massacred in large numbers.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.120]   So the Arab effort to pressure the British
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.080]   to prevent Jews reaching Palestine's safe shores
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:10.120]   contributed indirectly to the slaughter
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.800]   of many Jews in Europe
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.320]   'cause they couldn't get to anywhere
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.880]   and they couldn't get to Palestine
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.840]   'cause the Arabs were busy attacking Jews in Palestine
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.720]   and attacking the British to make sure
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.280]   they didn't allow Jews to reach this safe haven.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.280]   That's important.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.600]   The second thing is, of course,
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.680]   there's no point in belittling the fact
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.800]   that the Palestinian Arab National Movement's leader,
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.360]   Husseini, worked for the Nazis in the 1940s.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.600]   He got a salary from the German Foreign Ministry.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.280]   He raised troops among Muslims in Bosnia for the SS
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.880]   and he broadcast to the Arab world
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.360]   calling for the murder of the Jews in the Middle East.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.200]   This is what he did.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.760]   And the Arabs, since then,
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.720]   have been trying to whitewash Husseini's role.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.440]   I'm not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust,
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.040]   but he helped the Germans along
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.440]   in doing what they were doing
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.000]   and supported them in doing that.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.360]   So this can't be removed from the fact
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.240]   that the Arabs, as you say, paid a price for the Holocaust,
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.720]   but they also participated in various ways
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.800]   in helping it happen.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.640]   - I'll make two points.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.160]   The first is, you mentioned Haj Amin al-Husseini
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.400]   and his collaboration with the Nazis,
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:34.840]   entirely legitimate point to raise,
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.240]   but I think one can also say definitively
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.440]   had Haj Amin al-Husseini never existed,
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:46.440]   the Holocaust would have played out precisely as it did.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.800]   As far as Palestinian opposition
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.840]   to Jewish immigration to Palestine
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.520]   during the 1930s is concerned,
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.160]   it was of a different character than, for example,
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:04.080]   British and American rejection of Jewish immigration.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.920]   They just didn't want Jews on their soil.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.680]   - Objectively, it helped the Germans kill the Jews.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:10.160]   - In the Palestinian case,
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.000]   their opposition to Jewish immigration
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.200]   was to prevent the transformation of their homeland
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.160]   into a Jewish state that would dispossess them.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.920]   And I think that's an important distinction to make.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.320]   The other point I wanted to make
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.080]   is we've spent the past several hours
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.520]   talking about Zionism, transfer, and so on,
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.280]   but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this,
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.160]   which is that Zionism, I think,
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.920]   would have emerged and disappeared
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.240]   as yet one more utopian political project
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.120]   had it not been for the British,
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.360]   what the preeminent Palestinian historian,
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.840]   Walid Khaledi, has termed the British shield,
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.720]   because I think without the British sponsorship,
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.100]   we wouldn't be having this discussion today.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:07.320]   The British sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason,
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.680]   which is that during World War I,
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:15.280]   the Ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suez Canal.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.280]   Suez Canal was the jugular vein of the British Empire
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:23.520]   between Europe and India,
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.680]   and the British came to the conclusion
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.680]   that they needed to secure the Suez Canal from any threat.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.760]   And as the British have done so often in so many places,
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.800]   how do you deal with this?
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   Well, you bring in a foreign minority,
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.240]   implant them amongst a hostile population,
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:47.520]   and establish a protectorate over them.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.720]   I don't think a Jewish state in Palestine
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.000]   had been part of British intentions,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.440]   and the Balfour Declaration very specifically speaks
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.640]   about a Jewish national home in Palestine,
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.960]   in other words, a British protectorate.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.720]   Things ended up taking a different course,
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.320]   and I think the most important development
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.360]   was World War II,
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.760]   and I think this had maybe less to do with the Holocaust,
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.400]   and more to do with the effective bankruptcy
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.080]   of the United Kingdom during that war,
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.800]   and its inability to sustain its global empire.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.880]   It ended up giving up India,
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.600]   ended up giving up Palestine,
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.960]   and it's in that context, I think,
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.000]   that we need to see the emergence
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.640]   of a Jewish state in Palestine.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.280]   And again, a Jewish state means a state
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.320]   in which the Jewish community enjoys
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.280]   not only a demographic majority,
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.480]   but an uncontestable demographic majority,
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.080]   an uncontestable territorial hegemony,
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.800]   and an uncontestable political supremacy.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.760]   And that is also why, after 1948,
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.240]   the nascent Israeli state confiscated,
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.640]   I believe, up to 90% of lands
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.760]   that had been previously owned
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.000]   by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.240]   It is why the new Israeli state
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.040]   imposed a military government
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.480]   on its population of Palestinian citizens
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.960]   between 1948 and 1966.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.040]   It is why the Israeli state
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:43.040]   effectively reduced the Palestinians
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.720]   living within the Israeli state
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.960]   as citizens of the Israeli state
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.960]   to second-class citizens,
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.440]   on the one hand, promoting Jewish nationalism
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.840]   and Jewish nationalist parties,
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:56.580]   on the other hand, doing everything within its power
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:59.440]   to suppress and eliminate Palestinian
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.720]   or Arab nationalist movements.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.640]   And that's why today there's a consensus
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.600]   among all major human rights organizations
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.720]   that Israel is an apartheid state.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.120]   With the Israeli human rights organization,
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.720]   B'Tselem describes a regime of Jewish supremacy
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:19.860]   between the river and the sea.
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:21.720]   - You're really tempting a response
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.000]   from the other side on the last few sentences.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.120]   - Propaganda, yeah, okay.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.800]   We'll talk about the claims of apartheid and so on.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.640]   It's a fascinating discussion, we need to have it.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   Norm?
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.640]   - On the question of the responsibility
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.280]   of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi holocaust,
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.980]   direct or indirect, I consider that an absurd claim.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:49.320]   As Gromyko said, and I quoted him,
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.520]   the entire Western world turned its back on the Jews
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.960]   to somehow focus on the Palestinians
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.040]   strikes me as completely ridiculous.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.840]   Number two, as Muin said,
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:06.720]   there's a perfectly understandable reason
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.160]   why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.020]   because in their minds and not irrationally,
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:17.120]   these Jews intended to create a Jewish state
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.400]   which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.800]   I'm a very generous person.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.800]   I've actually taken in a homeless person
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.860]   for two and a half years.
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:32.160]   But if I knew in advance that that homeless person
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.880]   was going to try to turn me out of my apartment,
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.880]   I would think 10,000 times before I took him in, okay?
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.020]   As far as the actual complicity of the Palestinian Arabs,
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.000]   if you look at Raoul Hilberg's three volume classic work,
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.760]   "The Destruction of the European Jewry",
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.880]   he has in those thousand plus pages,
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.880]   one sentence on the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.080]   And that I think is probably an overstatement,
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.000]   but we'll leave it aside.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.640]   The only two points I would make
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.260]   aside from the holocaust point is,
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:19.360]   number one, I do think the transfer discussion
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.400]   is useful because it indicates
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.320]   that there was a rational reason
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.320]   behind the Arab resistance
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.840]   to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine,
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.280]   the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.720]   And number two, there are two issues.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.680]   One is the history, and the second is
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.860]   being responsible for your words.
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:51.720]   Now, some people accuse me of speaking very slowly,
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.920]   and they're advised on YouTube
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.520]   to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.100]   One of the reasons I speak slowly
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:06.100]   is because I attach value to every word I say.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:11.040]   And it is discomforting, disorienting,
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:16.040]   where you have a person who's produced a voluminous corpus
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.040]   rich in insights and rich in archival sources,
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:30.700]   who seems to disown each and every word
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:34.820]   that you pluck from that corpus
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:37.660]   by claiming that it's either out of context
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:39.900]   or it's cherry picking.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.980]   Words count.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.620]   And I agree with Lex.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:48.660]   Everybody has the right to rescind
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.900]   what they've said in the past.
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:53.660]   But what you cannot claim
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.860]   is that you didn't say what you said.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:00.460]   - I'll stick to the history, not the current propaganda.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:03.980]   1917, the British,
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.420]   the Zionist movement began way before the British
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:08.940]   supported the Zionist movement for decades.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.260]   In 1917, the British jumped in
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.480]   and issued the Balfour Declaration
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.500]   supporting the emergence
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.080]   of a Jewish national home in Palestine,
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.860]   which most people understood to mean
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.580]   eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine.
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.460]   Most people understood that in Britain
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.520]   and among the Zionists and among the Arabs.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.300]   But the British declared the Balfour Declaration
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:32.180]   or issued the Balfour Declaration
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.740]   not only because of imperial self-interest.
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.860]   And this is what you're basically saying.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:39.540]   They had the imperial interests, a buffer state,
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:42.700]   which would protect the Suez Canal from the east.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.500]   The British also were motivated by idealism.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.620]   And this incidentally is how Balfour
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:51.460]   described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:54.900]   And he said, the Western world, Western Christendom
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:56.940]   owes the Jews a great debt,
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:01.340]   both for giving the world and the West, if you like,
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:06.340]   values, social values, as embodied in the Bible,
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:09.180]   social justice and all sorts of other things.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.300]   And the Christian world owes the Jews
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:14.500]   because it persecuted them for 2000 years.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.860]   This debt we're now beginning to repay
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:21.220]   with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism.
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:23.420]   But it's also worth remembering
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:27.440]   that the Jews weren't proxies or attached
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.860]   to the British imperial endeavor.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:34.700]   They were happy to receive British support in 1917.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:37.700]   And then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:42.100]   for 20, 30 years, but they weren't part
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:45.540]   of the British imperial design or mission.
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.420]   They wanted a state for themselves.
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.180]   The Jews happy to have the British support them,
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:53.020]   happy today to have the Americans support Israel.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:54.820]   But it's not because we're stooges
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:58.040]   or extensions of American imperial interests.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:01.620]   The British incidentally always described
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:03.940]   in Arab narratives of propaganda
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.740]   as consistent supporters of Zionism.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:07.580]   They weren't.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:11.500]   The first British rulers in Palestine, 1917, 1920--
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:12.340]   - Herbert Samuel.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:13.860]   - No, before Herbert Samuel.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.620]   Samuel came in 1920.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:18.460]   The British ruled there for three years previously.
[01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:20.980]   And most of the leaders, the British generals
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.940]   and so on who were in Palestine were anti-Zionist.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:26.300]   And subsequently in the 20s and 30s,
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.100]   the British occasionally curbed Zionist immigration
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:30.940]   to Palestine.
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:33.380]   And in 1939 switched horses
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:36.560]   and supported the Arab national movement and not Zionism.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.780]   They turned anti-Zionist and basically said,
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.380]   "You Arabs will rule Palestine within the next 10 years.
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:43.500]   This is what we're giving you
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:46.820]   by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine."
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.820]   But the Arabs didn't actually understand
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.060]   what they were being given
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:52.540]   on the silver platter, Husseini again.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:54.500]   And he said, "No, no, we can't accept
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.980]   the British white paper of May 1939,"
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:59.860]   which had given the Arabs everything they wanted basically,
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:02.940]   self-determination in an Arab majority state.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.540]   So what I'm saying is the British at some point
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.380]   did support the Zionist enterprise,
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:12.300]   but at other points were less consistent in the support.
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:16.120]   And in 1939 until 1948, when they didn't vote
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:19.340]   even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:22.620]   in the UN resolution, they didn't support Zionism
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.700]   during the last decade of the mandate.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.940]   It's worth remembering that.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.420]   - I'd like to respond to that.
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:30.120]   I mean, speaking of propaganda,
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:36.780]   I find it simply impossible to accept that Balfour,
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:40.620]   who as British prime minister in 1905
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:44.580]   was a chief sponsor of the Aliens Act,
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:46.660]   which was specifically-- - He changed his mind.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.340]   - Which was specifically designed--
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.940]   - To keep out Jews. - To keep persecuted
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:54.820]   Eastern European Jews out of the streets of the UK,
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:58.140]   and who was denounced as an anti-Semite
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:01.860]   by the entire British Jewish establishment.
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:03.940]   A decade later, all of a sudden--
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:07.500]   - Changed his mind. - People change their minds.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:12.100]   But when the changing of the mind
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:15.620]   just coincidentally happens to coincide
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:18.860]   with the British imperial interest,
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.380]   I think perhaps the transformation
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:24.420]   is a little more superficial
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.980]   than he's being given credit for.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:30.440]   It was clearly a British imperial venture,
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.820]   and if there had been no threat to the Suez Canal
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.220]   during World War I,
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:38.260]   regardless of what Balfour would have thought
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.220]   about the Jews and their contribution
[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:43.860]   to history and their persecution and so on,
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.420]   there would have been no Balfour Declaration.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:46.620]   - Can I ask you real quick a question on that?
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:49.260]   Why did the British ever cap immigration then
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:51.740]   from Jews to that area at all?
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.580]   - Well, we're talking now about--
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:55.540]   - '20s, '30s. - '19, '17.
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:57.220]   - Sure, but I'm saying that if the whole goal
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.860]   was just to be an imperialist project,
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:01.860]   there were terrorist attacks from Jewish--
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.580]   - Yes, but I'll answer you. - Yeah, in the '40s, yeah.
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.780]   - And we're talking now about 1917,
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.700]   and as I mentioned earlier,
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:13.460]   I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:16.020]   That's why they used the term Jewish national home.
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:19.580]   I think what they wanted was a British protectorate,
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:24.380]   loyal to and dependent upon the British.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:28.820]   I think an outstanding review of British policy
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:30.300]   towards these issues during the Mandate
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:33.220]   has been done by Martin Bunton
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:35.020]   of the University of Victoria,
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:38.500]   and he basically makes the argument
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:43.660]   that once the British realized the mess they were in,
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:47.420]   certainly by the late '20s, early '30s,
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:51.820]   they recognized the mess they were in,
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.980]   the irreconcilable differences,
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.180]   and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:03.220]   And muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine,
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:08.500]   whose overall purpose was to serve
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:13.100]   for the development of Zionist institutions,
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.420]   Yeshuv's economy, and so on,
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:18.380]   meant, even if the British
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:21.260]   were not self-consciously doing this,
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:22.740]   preparing the groundwork
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:25.260]   for the eventual establishment of a Jewish state.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.740]   I don't know if that answers your question.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.340]   - Except they did turn anti-Zionist in 1939.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:30.180]   - Yes, of course.
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:31.820]   - And maintained that anti-- - They were being shot off
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.420]   by the Kurds. - And maintained that Zionist,
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.980]   no, no, before they were being shot off,
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:38.460]   but maintained that anti-Zionist posture until 1948.
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.300]   - Okay.
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:41.780]   - And if I may, just also one point.
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:44.260]   You mentioned Haj Amin al-Husseini
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.540]   during, well, entirely legitimate.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:51.140]   But what I would also point out
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:55.940]   is that you had a Zionist organization, the Lehi.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.020]   - 300 people.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.620]   - 300 people, one of whom happened
[01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:00.380]   to become an Israeli prime minister,
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.620]   an Israeli foreign minister,
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.380]   a speaker of Israeli parliament.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.140]   - Maybe you should give his name.
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:10.540]   - Yitzhak Shamir, proposing an alliance
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.740]   with Nazi Germany in 1941.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:15.260]   - Shamir proposed the-- - Shamir, well, no,
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.740]   the Lehi proposed.
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.260]   - Some people in the Lehi proposed--
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:19.100]   - Of which Shamir was a prominent leader.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.740]   - Yeah, but this is a red herring also.
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:22.900]   - No, no, okay, well, if he's a red herring,
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:26.020]   Haj Amin al-Husseini is a red whale.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:26.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:30.100]   - The Lehi was an unimportant organization in the Yishuv.
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:33.460]   300 people versus 30,000 belonged to the Haganah.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.620]   So it was not a very important organization.
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:38.180]   It's true, before the Holocaust actually began,
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:39.980]   they wanted allies against the British,
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:40.820]   where they could find them.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.020]   - We're talking 1941 here, not 1931.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:43.860]   - We're talking 1940.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.180]   - '41, from what I recall.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:48.740]   - 1940, they approached the German emissary
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:50.500]   in Istanbul or something. - In Ankara, yes.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:55.500]   - And if I may, proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.060]   on what the Lehi described as on the basis
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:02.380]   of shared ideological principles.
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:03.620]   - No, they didn't share ideological principles.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:04.620]   - Well, they said they did.
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:05.460]   - No, they didn't.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:06.300]   - They did revile--
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.740]   - Why are you doing these things?
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.340]   Of course they said it, you know the state,
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:13.740]   but you know what the statement said
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:16.620]   on the basis of a shared ideology.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:17.860]   Why do you say no?
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:18.700]   - You think that the--
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:20.620]   - Wait, wait, wait, the Lehi people were Nazis.
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:21.460]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:22.300]   - I'm saying that--
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.140]   - Did you say that?
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:24.900]   No, are you saying that?
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:25.900]   Forget statements.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:27.100]   You like to quote things.
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.140]   But were they Nazis?
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:31.260]   Were the Lehi Nazis?
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:32.780]   That's what I'm asking.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.620]   - What did he say?
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:34.460]   - Some of them supported Stalin incidentally.
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:36.340]   - Did he say that the basis of the pact
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.300]   was their agreement on ideology?
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:39.220]   - There wasn't any pact.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.780]   They suggested, they proposed an agreement.
[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:43.300]   - And what did the agreement say?
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.180]   - They wanted arms against the British.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:46.020]   That's what they wanted.
[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:46.860]   - What did the agreement say?
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:48.460]   - Khashamina Hosseini wanted also.
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:49.300]   That's what--
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:50.140]   - No, no, but they didn't--
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:50.980]   - Others in India--
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:52.940]   - The Lehi people didn't work in Berlin
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.380]   helping the Nazi regime.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:55.980]   - I mean, it's what the IRA wanted also.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:58.740]   - No, but this is what Khashamina Hosseini did.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:00.660]   You know that he was an anti-Semite.
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.180]   You've probably read some of his works.
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:04.020]   - Yeah.
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:04.860]   - He wasn't just anti-British.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:05.700]   - Yes, and--
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:06.540]   - He was also anti-Semitic.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:07.380]   - And--
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:08.540]   - So he had a common ground with Hitler.
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:09.380]   - I think--
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:10.220]   - It's a simple fact.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:11.060]   - I think we can agree.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:12.780]   - Not every anti-Semite is a Hitlerite.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:13.620]   I think we can--
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:14.460]   - But that part--
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:16.380]   - He literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:17.700]   He wasn't just a guy posting or--
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:20.460]   - Yes, and he was an absolutely revolting,
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.820]   disgusting human being.
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:23.660]   - This I'm happy to hear.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:24.740]   - I have no--
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:25.580]   - But the problem is you're saying--
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:26.420]   - If you think--
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:27.260]   - I don't believe that.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.100]   - You're saying that Hosseini was his influence,
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:28.940]   you're saying the Mufti was--
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:32.080]   - But I don't even understand of all the crimes
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.700]   you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people,
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:39.820]   trying to blame them directly, indirectly, indirectly,
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:43.780]   or indirectly three times to move for the Nazi Holocaust
[01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.060]   is completely lunatic.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.020]   - Hold on, wait, there's not a,
[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:48.780]   he's not blaming them for the Holocaust.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.600]   He's saying that from the perspective--
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.440]   - No, no, no.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.260]   - Wait, wait, wait, no.
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:53.580]   He's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region,
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.260]   Palestinians would have been part of the region.
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:56.100]   That is exactly--
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:56.920]   - That's not what he's saying.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:57.760]   You have not read him.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.600]   - That is exactly what he said.
[01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.420]   - I've read him.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:00.260]   - You've read him and you don't understand him.
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.100]   - You've read Wikipedia.
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:01.920]   - He says right here.
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.980]   - Believe me, I'm a lot more literate than you, Mr. Borrelli.
[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:04.820]   - I'm gonna believe the guy that wrote the stuff.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:06.460]   - You read what Wikipedia says.
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.300]   - That's great.
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.120]   - I read Danny Morris.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:08.960]   - And you don't even speak Hebrew
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.460]   and you call yourself an Israeli historian.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.780]   We're all here on different grounds.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:13.420]   - I just want, if I can just respond to--
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.140]   - Well, no, no, I'm just saying that there were two tricks.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:17.980]   That's fine.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:19.120]   There were two tricks that are being played here
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:20.100]   that I think is interesting.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.340]   One is you guys claim that the Leahy was trying
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.860]   to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:25.300]   because of a shared ideology.
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:26.120]   - That's what they said.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:26.960]   - Yeah, but hold on.
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.780]   No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.260]   No, no, it's about what you said.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:32.100]   You brought that up to imply that Zionism
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:34.020]   must be inexorably linked to--
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:34.860]   - No, I'm sorry.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.620]   - No, you're putting words in my mouth.
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.100]   - Okay, wait, well, then what was the purpose
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:39.980]   of saying that the Leahy claimed that they,
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:42.020]   the Leahy who were a small group of people
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:43.660]   that were reviled by many in Israel.
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.780]   - Not many, by everybody practically.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:46.980]   They were called terrorists.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.820]   - So reviled.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.260]   - The Zionist movement called them terrorists.
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:54.260]   - Yes, yes, and Shamir called himself a terrorist.
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:57.260]   They were so irrelevant that their leader
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:59.180]   ended up being kicked upstairs
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.860]   to the leader of the Israeli parliament.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:01.700]   - That's Israeli parliament.
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:04.420]   - To the Israeli, to Israeli foreign minister.
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:06.100]   - And Begin was also--
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.100]   - Yes, you wanna characterize him as irrelevant as well?
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:09.940]   Go ahead.
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.380]   - No, no, no, characterize him as relevant or irrelevant
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:12.620]   based on what happens decades later.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.260]   The timeline matters.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:15.100]   - Well--
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.220]   - The question is, what is the point of saying
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.660]   that the Leahy tried to forge an alliance--
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:20.460]   - Why is, why is, why is--
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.740]   - Relevant is bringing up the Mufti of Jerusalem
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:25.900]   and trying to blame the Holocaust indirectly.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:29.220]   - No, no, no, the Mufti was the leader
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:31.780]   of the Palestine Arab National Movement.
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:32.620]   The Leahy was 300 people.
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.820]   - And he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did.
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.820]   - No, he recruited people for the SS.
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:39.660]   How can you get away from that?
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:41.060]   - No, he recruited soldiers--
[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.060]   - People for the SS.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:45.460]   - He recruited soldiers in the Balkans, mostly Kosovars,
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.940]   which was disgusting.
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:48.820]   I have no doubt about that.
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:49.660]   But he had one--
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.100]   - He also wrote letters to foreign ministers--
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:51.940]   - He got one sentence--
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:53.540]   - Saying, "Don't let the Jews out."
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:54.380]   - I knew Rahul Hilberg.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:56.540]   - Can I say, the Israeli foreign minister--
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.380]   - I knew Rahul Hilberg.
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.220]   - The Italian foreign minister--
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:01:59.060]   - I knew Rahul Hilberg.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:01.060]   - Received letters from Husseini during the Holocaust.
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:01.900]   - One sentence--
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:05.540]   - "Don't let the Jews out, don't let the Jews out."
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:07.340]   I'm not saying he was a major architect of the Holocaust.
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:09.460]   - He wasn't even minor.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.300]   - But if we're agreed--
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:11.180]   - One sentence--
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.700]   - If we're agreed that Haj Amin al-Husseini,
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.220]   the Mufti of Jerusalem,
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:19.780]   collaborated with the Nazis during World War II
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:22.540]   and actively sought their sponsorship,
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:24.020]   why is it irrelevant--
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:26.500]   - And probably wanted the destruction of European Jewry.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:28.300]   - He probably wanted a lot of things.
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:29.140]   - Okay.
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:30.300]   - Okay?
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.780]   - If that's relevant,
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:35.940]   why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel--
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.780]   - Not prime minister.
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:40.180]   In 1941, he wasn't prime minister of Israel.
[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:42.780]   He was a leader of a very small terrorist group.
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:43.620]   - So do you consider--
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.020]   - The Nazis' terrorists by the mainstream of Zionism.
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:49.060]   - Do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago,
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.820]   Mahmoud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis,
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:52.660]   which is basically tantamount--
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:54.260]   - It showed something about Mahmoud Abbas.
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.100]   - Okay, but--
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:55.980]   - But I didn't bring it up.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.820]   You're the one who's bringing it up.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.300]   - Yes, but you consider that relevant--
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:00.540]   - Belittling the Holocaust, that's what you're saying.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.100]   The president of the Palestinian National Authority
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:06.340]   belittled the Holocaust and it didn't happen,
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.180]   or only a few Jews died.
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:09.860]   - I think that's a fair characterization of Mahmoud Abbas.
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:10.820]   - But I didn't bring it up.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:11.780]   - I brought it up.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.620]   - Yeah.
[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:14.220]   - Okay, because my question is,
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:18.420]   then why is Shamir's antecedency relevant?
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.220]   - He was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group.
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:23.060]   - Who became Israel--
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.020]   - Khadjam Min al-Husseini was the head
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.500]   of the movement at the time.
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:26.500]   - Also, but the point I'm bringing--
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.340]   - There's no comparison.
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:29.180]   - The point of bringing up Husseini's stuff
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:31.940]   wasn't to say that he was a great further of the Holocaust.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:33.660]   It's that he might have been a great further
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.220]   in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.060]   to escape the Holocaust.
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:37.900]   - Yes, but the point I make--
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:38.740]   - That was the point.
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:43.740]   - And I explained why I think that's not an entirely
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.180]   accurate characterization,
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:49.580]   but then I wanted to make another point.
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:53.820]   If it's legitimate to bring up his role during World War II,
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:57.460]   why is it illegitimate to bring up a man
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.940]   who would become Israel's Speaker of Parliament,
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:01.780]   Foreign Minister--
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:02.900]   - 40 years hence, 40 years hence.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:05.100]   - Why is it, and also--
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:05.940]   - He was a young terrorist.
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:08.860]   - And was also responsible for the murder
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:13.140]   of the United Nations' first international envoy,
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:15.220]   Bernadotte, Foki Bernadotte.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:16.580]   Why is all that irrelevant?
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:17.420]   - I don't think anybody--
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:18.260]   - I don't understand.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.660]   - I think that the reason why he was brought up
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:23.500]   was because Jewish people in this time period
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:26.820]   would have viewed it as there was a prevention of Jews
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:28.780]   leaving Europe because of the Palestinians
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.740]   pressuring the British to put a curb
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:33.180]   that 75,000 immigration limit, yes.
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:36.020]   But it's not about them furthering the Holocaust
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.140]   or being an architect, major or minor play in the Holocaust.
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:38.980]   - Well, actually--
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:40.020]   - We use a major play in that region.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:40.860]   So if you wanted to bring up--
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:44.020]   - Actually, Eddie Morris made the specific claim
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:46.660]   that the Palestinians played an indirect role
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:47.500]   in the Holocaust.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.860]   - The indirect role would have been the prevention
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:50.140]   of people escaping from--
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:54.100]   - Yes, and my response to that is,
[02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:57.460]   first of all, I disagree with that characterization.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.300]   But second of all--
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:04:59.740]   - How can you disagree with that?
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:01.900]   They prevented, they forced the British
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:04.180]   to prevent emigration of Jews from Europe
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:06.260]   and reaching safe shores in Palestine.
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.100]   That's what they did.
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:07.940]   - Again, was--
[02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:10.060]   - And they knew that the Jews were being persecuted
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:10.900]   in Europe at the time.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.980]   - Was Palestine the only spot of land on earth?
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:15.580]   - Yes, basically that was the problem.
[02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:17.020]   The Jews couldn't emigrate anywhere else.
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:19.460]   - What about your great friends in Britain,
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:21.500]   the architects of the Balfour Declaration?
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.620]   - By the late 1930s--
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:23.460]   - What about the United States?
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.980]   - They weren't happy to take in Jews,
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:27.100]   and the Americans weren't happy to take in Jews.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:30.180]   - And why are Palestinians, who were not Europeans,
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.500]   who had zero role in the rise of Nazism,
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.420]   who had no relation to any of this,
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:38.580]   why are they somehow uniquely responsible
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.500]   for what happened in Europe and uniquely culpable?
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.820]   - They were helping to close the only safe haven for Jews.
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:43.660]   That's all.
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:44.500]   - Oh, really, the United States
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.260]   wasn't a potential safe haven.
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:49.700]   - The only one was Palestine.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:50.540]   - At the time--
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:52.700]   - The United States had no room--
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:53.540]   - No, it did have room.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:55.460]   - From the Atlantic to the Pacific for Jews.
[02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:56.300]   - It did have room, but it didn't want Jews.
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:59.100]   - So that wasn't the only safe haven.
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:05:59.940]   - This is something--
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.740]   - But shouldn't you be focusing your anger and outrage?
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:04.340]   - America should be blamed for not letting Jews in
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:05.180]   during the '30s and '40s.
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:08.260]   - They are blamed, but nobody blames them for the Holocaust.
[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.100]   - Well, indirectly.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:09.940]   - Indirectly.
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:13.020]   - I've never heard it said that Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:15.580]   was indirectly responsible for the Holocaust.
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:17.020]   I never heard that.
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:18.940]   Now, maybe it's in Israeli literature
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:21.580]   because the Israelis have gone mad.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:24.820]   Yes, your prime minister said the whole idea
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:28.500]   of the gas chambers came from the Mufti of Jerusalem.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.340]   - That's nonsense.
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:30.180]   - Yeah, but he said it--
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.020]   - We all know that's nonsense.
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:34.220]   - But we also know that Netanyahu said it, correct?
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:36.340]   - Netanyahu says so many things which are absurd
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:37.180]   or simple lies. - And he happens to be
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:38.740]   the prime minister's longest-serving
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:39.580]   prime minister of Israel. - I cannot be responsible
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:40.420]   for them.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.260]   I cannot be responsible for them.
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.820]   - You're not responsible for them,
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:45.220]   but it is relevant that he's the longest-serving
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:46.420]   prime minister of Israel.
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:48.700]   - Unfortunately, it says something about the Israeli public.
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:52.300]   - Yes, and he gets selected, not despite saying such things,
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:53.700]   but because he says such things.
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:57.020]   - His voters don't care about Khadim al-Husseini or Hitler.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:59.380]   They know nothing about his voters.
[02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:00.220]   - You may well be right.
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:02.540]   - His base know nothing about anything,
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:04.420]   and he can say what he likes, and they'll say yes,
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:06.220]   or they don't care if he says these things.
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:09.300]   - You may well be right, but anyway,
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:12.620]   not to beat a dead horse, but I still don't understand.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:14.700]   - That's not beating a dead horse, you're right.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:16.700]   - I'll just conclude by saying I don't understand
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.940]   why the Mufti of Jerusalem is relevant.
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:20.940]   - He is relevant, he is relevant.
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:23.860]   - But Yishak Shamir is not relevant.
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:26.420]   - Because Shamir wasn't the head of the national movement.
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:29.580]   He represented 100 or 200 or 300 gunmen
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:30.860]   who were considered terrorists
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.100]   by the Zionist movement at the time.
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.620]   The fact that 30 years later, he becomes prime minister,
[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:37.140]   that's the crux of history.
[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:37.980]   - And his history is not--
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:39.820]   - But Khadim al-Husseini was the head
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.780]   of the Palestine Arab National Movement at the time.
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:43.620]   - Anyway, I--
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:44.460]   - What can you do?
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:45.620]   - We're speaking past each other.
[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:47.940]   - We're not, I'm talking facts.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:50.940]   - Let's move to the modern day and we'll return to history,
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:53.700]   maybe '67 and other important moments,
[02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:56.740]   but let's look to today, in the recent months.
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.540]   October 7th, let me ask sort of a pointed question.
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:05.900]   Was October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel genocidal?
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.420]   Was it an act of ethnic cleansing?
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:11.780]   Just so we lay out the moral calculus
[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:13.660]   that we are engaged in.
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:14.980]   I don't know, maybe you was--
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:18.660]   - The problem with October 7th is this.
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:23.660]   The Hamas fighters who invaded southern Israel
[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:30.860]   were sent, ordered to murder, rape,
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:33.140]   and do all the nasty things that they did,
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:35.660]   and they killed some 1,200 Israelis that day
[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:40.660]   and abducted, as we know, something like 250 civilian,
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.500]   mostly civilians, also some soldiers,
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:47.660]   took them back to Gaza, dungeons in Gaza.
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:50.620]   But they were motivated, not just by the words
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:53.420]   of their current leader in the Gaza Strip,
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.060]   but by their ideology, which is embedded in their charter
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:01.060]   from 1988, if I remember correctly.
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:03.460]   And that charter is genocidal.
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:06.780]   It says that the Jews must be eradicated, basically,
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:10.180]   from the land of Israel, from Palestine.
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:13.900]   The Jews are described there as sons of apes and pigs.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.660]   The Jews are a base people, killers of prophets,
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:19.980]   and they should not exist in Palestine.
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:22.340]   It doesn't say that they necessarily should be murdered
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.820]   all around the world, the Hamas charter,
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.980]   but certainly the Jews should be eliminated from Palestine.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:32.980]   And this is the driving ideology behind the massacre
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:35.300]   of the Jews on October 7th,
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.300]   which brought down on the Gaza Strip.
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:40.340]   And I think with the intention by the Hamas
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.140]   of the Israeli counter-offensive,
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:44.580]   'cause they knew that that counter-offensive
[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:47.180]   would result in many Palestinian dead
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:51.260]   because the Hamas fighters and their weaponry and so on
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:53.740]   were embedded in the population in Gaza.
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:55.860]   And they hoped to benefit from this
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:57.740]   in the eyes of world public opinion,
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:59.980]   as Israel chased these Hamas people
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:01.900]   and their ammunition dumps and so on,
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:05.020]   and killed lots of Palestinian civilians in the process.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.860]   All of this was understood by Sinwar,
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:10.660]   by the head of the Hamas, and he strived for that.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.660]   But initially, he wanted to kill as many Jews as he could
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:18.220]   in the border areas around the Gaza Strip.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:21.420]   - I'll respond directly to the points you made,
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:23.740]   and then I'll leave it to Norm
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:26.500]   to bring in the historical context.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:30.620]   That Hamas charter is from the '90s, I think.
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:32.340]   - 1988. - 1988.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:33.580]   So it's from the '80s.
[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.140]   - Um, I think your characterization of that charter
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:42.620]   as antisemitic is indisputable.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.780]   I think your characterization of that charter
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:51.580]   as genocidal is off the mark.
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:52.660]   - It's implicit.
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:57.660]   - And more importantly, that charter has been superseded
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:59.180]   by a new charter.
[02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:01.900]   It in fact has been, well, there is a--
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:02.820]   - There is no new charter.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.540]   - There is a charter. - There is an explanation,
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:05.980]   a statement they made-- - 2018,
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.620]   a political statement. - In 2000 and something.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:09.220]   - '18. - 2018.
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:12.260]   Supposedly clarifying things which are in the charter,
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:13.940]   but it doesn't actually step back
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:15.260]   from what the charter says.
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:17.900]   Eliminate Israel, eliminate the Jews from the land of Israel.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.620]   - And 2018, the Hamas charter,
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.860]   if we look at the current version of the charter--
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.900]   - It's not a called-to-charter.
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:26.340]   - Whether you-- - You're calling it a charter.
[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:27.180]   It wasn't.
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:28.940]   The only thing called-to-charter is what was issued
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:30.900]   in 1988 by Yassin himself.
[02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:33.740]   - Anyway, it makes a clear distinction
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:36.980]   between Jews and Zionists in 2018.
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:39.980]   Now, you can choose to dismiss it, believe it,
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:43.220]   it's sincere, it's insincere, whatever.
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:44.980]   - Insincere is probably the right word.
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:49.980]   - Secondly, I'm really unfamiliar with fighters
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:53.860]   who consult these kinds of documents before they go on--
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:56.180]   - No, they're brought up on this in their education system.
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:58.900]   In the kindergarten, they're told, kill the Jews.
[02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:02.580]   They practice with make-believe guns and uniforms
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:04.820]   when they're five years old in the kindergartens
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:06.420]   of the Hamas in Gaza. - At the instruction
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:08.640]   of the Commissioner General of UNRWA, right?
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:09.740]   - I didn't say that.
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:12.980]   I said the Hamas has kindergartens and summer camps
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:15.180]   in which they train to kill Jews,
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:16.660]   children six and five and six.
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:19.820]   - Secondly, you keep saying Jews,
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:20.940]   to which I would respond--
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:21.900]   - They use the word Jews.
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:25.900]   - To which I would respond that Hamas does not have a record
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:30.340]   of deliberately targeting Jews who are not Israelis.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:33.000]   And in fact, it also doesn't have a record
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.180]   of deliberately targeting either Jews or Israelis
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.700]   outside Israel and Palestine.
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:41.840]   So all this talk of--
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.300]   - Unlike the Hezbollah, which has targeted Jews outside--
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:48.580]   - We're talking about October 7th in Hamas.
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:51.100]   If you'd also like to speak about Hezbollah,
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.840]   let's get to that separately, if you don't mind.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.800]   So again, genocidal, well,
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.680]   if that term is going to be discussed,
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:06.920]   my first response would be,
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.640]   let's talk about potentially genocidal actions
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:13.560]   against Israelis rather than against Jews
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:15.780]   for the reasons that I just mentioned.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:18.800]   And again, I find this constant conflation
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.560]   of Jews-Israel-Zionism to be a bit disturbing.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:28.560]   Secondly, I think there are quite a few indications
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:34.400]   in the factual record that raise serious questions
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.640]   about the accusations of the genocidal intent
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:41.980]   and genocidal practice of what happened on October 7th.
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.680]   And my final point would be,
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:47.220]   I don't think I should take your word for it.
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:49.520]   I don't think you should take my word for it.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.840]   I think what we need here is a proper,
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:55.680]   independent, international investigation.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.360]   And the reason we need that-- - Of what?
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.800]   - Of genocide during this conflict,
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:04.800]   whether by Palestinians on October 7th or Israel thereafter.
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:08.460]   The reason that we need such an investigation
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:13.280]   is because Hamas is, there won't be any hearings
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.560]   on what Hamas did on October 7th
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.260]   at the International Court of Justice
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:21.040]   because the International Convention
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.360]   on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.800]   deals only with states and not with movements.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:30.040]   I think the International Criminal Court
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.560]   and specifically its current prosecutor,
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.440]   Karim Khan, lacks any and all credibility.
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.200]   He's been an absolute failure at his job.
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.000]   He's just been sitting on his backside
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.920]   for years on this file.
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:46.200]   And I think I would point out that Hamas has called
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:51.200]   for independent investigations of all these allegations.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.440]   Israel has categorically rejected
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.480]   any international investigation,
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.700]   of course fully supported by the United States.
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:01.920]   And I think what is required
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.380]   is to have credible investigations of these things
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:08.640]   because I don't think you're going to convince me,
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.680]   I don't think I'm going to convince you.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.640]   And this is two people sitting across the table
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:15.060]   from each other. - No, but there's certain things
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:16.640]   you don't even have to investigate.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.740]   You know how many citizens, civilians died
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.120]   in the October 7th assault. - Yes, but that's not--
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.160]   - You know that there are lots of allegations of rape.
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.640]   I don't know how persuaded you are of those.
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.060]   They did find bodies without heads, which is--
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.080]   - There were no beheadings. - Islamic,
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.080]   there were some beheadings apparently.
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:36.120]   - The Israelis didn't even claim that
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:39.200]   in the document they submitted before the ICJ.
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.200]   Go read what your government submitted.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:43.620]   It never mentioned beheadings.
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:45.080]   - Well, as far as I know-- - I read it.
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.480]   - There were some people who were beheaded, but then--
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:47.320]   - We could bring it up right now.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.680]   - You also denied that there were rapes there.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:51.720]   - I didn't deny, I said I've not seen
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:54.320]   convincing evidence that confirms it.
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.160]   I've said that from day one,
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.640]   and I'll say it today four and a half months later.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.140]   - Do you know that they killed eight or 900 civilians
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:02.280]   in the assault? - Absolutely.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.200]   That seems to me indisputable.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.880]   - Oh, okay, well, I'm glad that you're
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.800]   questioning something. - I've said that,
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:08.760]   I've said that from day one.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:09.840]   - Well, to be clear, you haven't.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.040]   You did a debate, I don't remember the talk show,
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:13.940]   but you seem to imply that there was a lot of crossfire
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:14.940]   and that it might have been the IDF
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:17.620]   that had killed a lot of-- - I said that there is
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:21.760]   no question, because the names were published in Haaretz,
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:26.120]   there is no question that roughly of the 1,200 people killed,
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.400]   800 of them were civilians.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:29.240]   I see-- - 850.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.580]   - 850, fine.
[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.680]   So I never said that, but then I said,
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.280]   no, we don't know exactly how they were killed,
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.280]   but 800 civilians killed, 850, no question there.
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.960]   And I also said, on repeated occasions,
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.320]   there cannot be any doubt, in my opinion,
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:48.700]   as of now, with the available evidence,
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:52.000]   that Hamas was responsible for significant atrocities,
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.280]   and I made sure to include the plural.
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:55.860]   - There's a lot of tricky language being employed here.
[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:56.700]   Do you think of the 800 of 50?
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:00.000]   - There's nothing tricky, it's called attaching value
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.960]   to words and not talking like a motor mouth.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:07.320]   I am very careful about qualifying,
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:09.400]   because that's what language is about.
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.720]   - That's great, then let me just ask a clarifying question.
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:13.280]   Do you firmly believe that the majority
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.480]   of the 850 civilians were killed by Hamas?
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:19.120]   - My view is, even if it were half,
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:24.120]   400 is a huge number, by any reckoning.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.680]   - Why? - Okay, wait, you didn't--
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:27.560]   - I said, even if-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:31.760]   - Because Benny, because Professor Morris,
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:36.760]   I don't know, I agree with Muin Rabbani.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.960]   I'm not sure if he concedes the 400.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.520]   I'll say-- - Why 400?
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:42.520]   - Because I have-- - Who ever thought
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.360]   up the 400? - Right, as I said--
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.560]   - 800 of the 850 slaughtered by Hamas.
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.080]   - No, I don't know-- - It may be a couple
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:51.600]   of individuals were killed in this very action.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.360]   - I don't know.
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.800]   - You're saying from day one-- - Professor Morris.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.640]   - You believe this particular thing--
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.840]   - Professor Morris. - And you clearly don't.
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:57.680]   You clearly don't believe this thing.
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:01.600]   - I said from day one, I-- - You said people died.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.000]   That's not controversial. - Wait, hold on, hold on.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.880]   - That's not controversial. - Mr. Bonnell,
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:10.080]   Mr. Bonnell, I attach value to words.
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:10.920]   - Yes, you've said that.
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.680]   If you value them, you talk about people so much.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.680]   - Mr. Bonnell, please slow down the speech
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:17.680]   and attempt to listen.
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:21.440]   When I was explicitly asked by Piers Morgan,
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:24.280]   I said there can be no question
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:27.000]   that Hamas committed atrocities--
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.480]   - I've heard this, yes. - On October 7th.
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.040]   If you want me to pin down a number, I can't do that.
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:35.440]   - I didn't ask you to pin down a number.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:36.280]   - You can listen to what I'm saying.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:37.800]   - You didn't ask me? - No, my question is,
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.280]   I'll ask, I'll ask a very precise--
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.480]   - Sorry, excuse me. - It's a very,
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:42.840]   it's a very easy question. - If I understood
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:43.680]   your question correctly.
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:45.440]   - My question is, do you think the majority of the people
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:47.160]   that were killed on October 7th, the civilians,
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:49.160]   were killed by Hamas, or are we subscribing to the idea
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:51.440]   that the IDF killed hundreds, 400 or 500--
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:54.040]   - No, but let me explain why that's a difficult question
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.160]   to answer.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:00.160]   The total number of civilians killed was 800, 850.
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.480]   We know that Hamas is responsible
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:07.160]   probably for the majority of those killings.
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:12.160]   We also know that there were killings by Islamic Jihad.
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:13.160]   We also know--
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:16.000]   - Oh, we're bunching together the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.040]   That's splitting hairs now. - His question was specifically
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:18.880]   about-- - No, but he means,
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:21.920]   he means the raiders. - I'm speaking in opposition
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:24.960]   to the conspiracy theory that people like,
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:27.440]   do you prefer Norm or Professor Frankelstein,
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.720]   or what do you, I don't know what your,
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:29.560]   how do you prefer to be addressed?
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:30.400]   - Well, it's not a conspiracy theory because it's--
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.080]   - Well, the conspiracy theory is the idea
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.840]   that the IDF killed the majority of them.
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:34.680]   - It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:37.080]   - And then there's also a theory that,
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:38.760]   as Norm pointed out on the show that he was on,
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.640]   that he thought that it was very strange
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.240]   that given how reputable Israeli services are
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:47.000]   when it comes to sending ambulances, retrieving bodies,
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.600]   he thought it was very strange that that number
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:49.840]   was continually being adjusted.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.120]   - And do you know why-- - So when you say that
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:53.080]   in combination with, well, I'm not sure
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:53.920]   how many were killed by Hamas--
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:54.960]   - Well, do you know why the number,
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:57.220]   do you know why the number went down?
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:00.040]   The number went down because the Israeli authorities
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.960]   were in possession of 200 corpses
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.480]   that were burned to a crisp that they assumed
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:12.480]   were Israelis who had been killed on October 7th.
[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:15.560]   They later determined that these were,
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:18.000]   in fact, Palestinian fighters.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.600]   Now, how does a Palestinian fighter get burned to a crisp?
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:23.040]   - No, you're mixing two things.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:25.640]   Some of the bodies they weren't able to identify,
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:28.440]   and eventually they ruled that some of them
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.920]   were actually Arab marauders rather than Israeli victims.
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:35.040]   Some, a few of them also, of the Jews,
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.360]   were burnt to a crisp, and it took them time
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:39.320]   to work this out, and they came out initially
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:42.160]   with a slightly higher figure, 1,400 dead,
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.320]   and eventually reduced it to 1,200 dead Israelis.
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:47.440]   - And the reason is that a proportion
[02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.800]   of Israeli civilians killed on October 7th,
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:51.800]   I don't believe it was a majority.
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:53.820]   We don't know how many.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:56.000]   Some were killed in crossfire.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.560]   Some were killed by Israeli shell fire,
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:03.040]   helicopter fire, and so on,
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:07.760]   and the majority were killed by Palestinians,
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:11.440]   and of that majority, we don't know.
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.360]   I mean, again, I understood your question
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.160]   as referring specifically to Hamas,
[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.480]   which is why I tried to answer it that way,
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:21.040]   but if you meant generically Palestinians, yes.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.040]   If you mean specifically Hamas,
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:24.640]   we don't have a clear breakdown
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:25.480]   of how many were-- - No, I don't mean
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:26.320]   specifically Hamas. - Okay.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.600]   - But I just think when you use the word some,
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.880]   that's doing a lot of heavy lifting.
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.000]   - Who used some?
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.640]   - That's fine, but some can mean anywhere
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:33.440]   from 1% to 49%.
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.960]   - But we don't know. - Who used some?
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:36.800]   - So the numbers here and the details
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:38.320]   are interesting and important,
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:39.640]   almost from a legal perspective,
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:43.240]   but if we zoom out the moral perspective,
[02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:45.600]   are Palestinians from Gaza justified
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:47.480]   in violent resistance?
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:51.800]   - Well, Palestinians have the right to resistance.
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:54.660]   Palestinian, that right includes the right
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:56.560]   to armed resistance.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:59.440]   At the same time, armed resistance
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:02.360]   is subject to the laws of war,
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.440]   and there are very clear regulations
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.920]   that separate legitimate acts of armed resistance
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:12.920]   from acts of armed resistance that are not legitimate.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:14.960]   - And the attacks of October 7th,
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:16.240]   where did they land for you?
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:19.800]   - There's been almost exclusive focus
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:23.800]   on the attacks on civilian population centers
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:27.880]   and the killings of civilians on October 7th.
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:34.320]   What is much less discussed to the point of amnesia
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:39.320]   is that there were very extensive attacks
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:42.880]   on Israeli military and intelligence facilities
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:44.480]   on October 7th.
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.700]   I would make a very clear distinction between those two.
[02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:53.700]   And secondly, I'm not sure that there was
[02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:58.140]   that I would characterize the efforts
[02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:02.380]   by Palestinians on October 7th
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:05.260]   to seize Israeli territory
[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:07.700]   and Israeli population centers
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:11.140]   as in and of themselves illegitimate.
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:13.700]   - You mean attacking Israeli civilians is legitimate?
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:15.540]   - No, no, no, that's not what I said.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.380]   - I didn't understand what you said.
[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:19.540]   - I think what you had on October 7th
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:23.260]   was an effort by Hamas to seize Israeli territory
[02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:24.100]   and population centers.
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:25.140]   - And kill civilians.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.680]   - That's not what I said.
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:31.680]   What I said is I think I would not describe
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:34.340]   the effort to seize Israeli territory
[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.100]   as in and of itself illegitimate,
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:41.220]   as a separate issue from the killing of Israeli civilians
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:42.940]   where in those cases
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:44.920]   where they had been deliberately targeted.
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:46.180]   That's very clearly illegitimate.
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:48.060]   - Whole families were slaughtered in Kibbutz.
[02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:48.900]   - But I'm making--
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.580]   - But many of them left wingers, incidentally,
[02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:55.340]   who helped Palestinians go to hospitals in Israel and so on.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:56.180]   - Again--
[02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:59.020]   - Even drove Palestinian cancer patients
[02:23:59.020 --> 02:23:59.860]   to hospitals in Israeli--
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:01.420]   - Again, I'm making a distinction here.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.220]   - But you don't seem to be very condemnatory
[02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:04.500]   of what the Hamas did.
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.900]   - Well, I don't do selective condemnation.
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:07.720]   - I'm not talking about selective.
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:08.560]   - I don't do selective outrage.
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:09.860]   - I'm talking about specific condemnation
[02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:11.700]   of this specific assault on civilians.
[02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:12.980]   - Well, you know what it is.
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:16.860]   - I would, for example, condemn Israeli assaults
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:19.580]   on civilians, deliberate assaults on civilians.
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:21.260]   I would condemn them, but you're not doing that
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:22.100]   with the Hamas.
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:23.820]   - You know what the issue is?
[02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:24.660]   - What?
[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.700]   - I've been speaking in public now,
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:28.380]   I would say since the late 1980s,
[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:30.220]   and interviewed and so on.
[02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:34.260]   I have never on one occasion ever been asked
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:37.040]   to condemn any Israeli act.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.880]   When I've been in group discussions,
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:43.140]   those supporting the Israeli action or perspective,
[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:45.860]   I have never encountered an example
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:48.420]   where these individuals are asked
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.980]   to condemn what Israel is doing.
[02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:55.460]   The demand and obligation of condemnation
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:25:00.060]   is exclusively applied, in my personal experience
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:03.940]   over decades, is exclusively applied to Palestinians.
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:04.780]   - No, this is not true.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:06.500]   Israel is condemned day and night
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:09.900]   on every television channel, and has been
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:10.740]   for the last decades.
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:12.500]   - I'm telling you about a personal experience
[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:13.500]   lasting decades.
[02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:18.500]   - You said, quote, I'm trying to quote what you just said.
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:20.820]   - I shouldn't have said anything at any point.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:22.820]   - You should say, Professor Morris.
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:23.660]   - Yes.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:26.860]   - You just said, I would condemn
[02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:31.860]   any time Israel deliberately attacks civilians, okay?
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:38.220]   The problem, Professor Morris, is over and over again,
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:44.100]   you claim in the face of overwhelming evidence
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:48.180]   that they didn't attack civilians.
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:50.540]   - That's not true, I've said Israel has attacked civilians.
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:51.380]   - Professor Morris.
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:52.580]   - In Kyiv, Israel attacked civilians.
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:53.420]   - Right, right, right, Professor Morris.
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:54.700]   - And I've written extensively about it.
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.540]   - Okay, I know that.
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:57.540]   - In Qatar, Qasem, they killed civilians,
[02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:58.380]   and I've written about it.
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:25:59.220]   - And now let's--
[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:01.900]   - So you're just eliminating, you're selecting.
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:02.740]   - Okay.
[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:04.500]   - As Steven says, you cherry-pick.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:05.340]   - If I were you--
[02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:06.180]   - Before you do--
[02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:07.000]   - You cherry-pick.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:07.840]   - Okay, let's fast forward.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:10.500]   When you were an adult, what did you say
[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:13.200]   about the 1982 Lebanon War?
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:15.140]   - What did I say?
[02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:16.180]   - You don't remember?
[02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:17.980]   Okay, allow me.
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:18.820]   - Uh-oh.
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:20.260]   - Okay.
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:25.260]   - So, it happens that I was not at all by any,
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:28.460]   I had no interest in the Israel-Palestine conflict
[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.580]   as a young man until the--
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:31.420]   - This is true.
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:34.220]   - Until the 1982 Lebanon War.
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:36.140]   - Yeah, you lost the passage.
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:36.980]   - I'll find it.
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:38.140]   - Okay, real quick, while he's searching for that--
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:38.980]   - Yeah, allow me, that's good.
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:40.540]   - You bring up something that's really important
[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.740]   that a lot of people don't draw a distinction between,
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:45.220]   in that there is just causes for war,
[02:26:45.220 --> 02:26:47.260]   and there is just ways to act within a war,
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:48.660]   and these two things, principally,
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.660]   do have a distinction from one another.
[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:52.980]   However, while I appreciate the recognition
[02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:56.820]   of the distinction, the idea that the cause for war
[02:26:56.820 --> 02:26:59.500]   that Hamas was engaged in, I don't believe,
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:01.240]   if we look at their actions in war
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:02.160]   or the statements that they've made,
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:03.100]   it doesn't seem like it had to do
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:04.860]   with territorial acquisition.
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:06.660]   - No, no, no, no, the point--
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:07.500]   - Like taking land back.
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:09.360]   - No, the point I was making was,
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:15.740]   what was Hamas trying to achieve militarily on October 7th?
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:20.700]   And I was pointing out that the focus has been very much
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:25.460]   on Hamas attacks on civilians and atrocities and so on,
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:28.260]   and I'm not saying those things should be ignored.
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:32.540]   What I'm saying is that what's getting lost in the shuffle
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:35.300]   is that there were extensive attacks
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:38.660]   on military and intelligence facilities,
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:42.100]   and as far as the, let's say,
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:44.600]   the other aspects are concerned,
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:47.580]   because I think either you or Lex asked me
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.720]   about the legitimacy of these attacks.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.720]   I said, I'm unclear whether efforts by Hamas
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:00.580]   to seize Israeli population centers in and of themselves
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:04.580]   are illegitimate, as opposed to actions
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.240]   that either deliberately targeted Israeli civilians,
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:14.240]   or actions that should reasonably have been expressed
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:18.060]   expected to result in the killings of Israeli civilians.
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:20.800]   Those strike me as, by definition, illegitimate,
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.940]   and I want to be very clear about that.
[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:24.780]   I have--
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:26.660]   - Illegitimate means you condemn them.
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:29.020]   - Illegitimate means they are not legitimate.
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:30.660]   I have a problem--
[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:31.780]   - Condemning your side, yes.
[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:33.380]   - No, not condemning my side.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.860]   I have a problem with selective outrage,
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:38.020]   and I have a problem with selective condemnation,
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:41.100]   and as I explained to you a few minutes ago,
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:46.100]   in my decades of appearing in public and being interviewed,
[02:28:46.100 --> 02:28:50.480]   I have never seen, I've never been asked
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:52.240]   to condemn an Israeli action.
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:54.840]   I've never been asked for a moral judgment
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:56.800]   on an Israeli action.
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:59.440]   Exclusive request for condemnation
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:01.200]   has to do with what Palestinians do,
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.200]   and just as importantly, I'm sure if you watch BBC or CNN,
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:09.640]   when is the last time an Israeli spokesperson
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.860]   has been asked to condemn an Israeli act?
[02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:14.420]   I've never seen it.
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:15.860]   - I don't think we condemn the Arab side either, though,
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:16.700]   right?
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.540]   I don't think there was any condemnation.
[02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:20.420]   - No, but now that we're talking about Israeli victims,
[02:29:20.420 --> 02:29:22.540]   all of a sudden, morality is central.
[02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:23.740]   - Well, I think the reason why it comes up
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:24.860]   is because there's no shortage
[02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:26.620]   of international condemnation for Israel.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:28.300]   As Norm will point out a million times,
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.100]   that there are 50 billion UN resolutions,
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:31.620]   you've got Amnesty International,
[02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:33.340]   you've got multiple bodies of the UN,
[02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:34.640]   you've got now this case for the ICJ,
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:36.420]   so there's no question of if there's condemnation for Israel.
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:37.740]   - But sorry, if I can interrupt you,
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:41.680]   in 1948, the entire world stood behind
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:44.640]   the establishment of a Jewish state,
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:45.480]   and the entire world--
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:47.520]   - No, no, except the Arab states and the Muslim states.
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:48.360]   - Well--
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:49.180]   - Not the entire world.
[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:50.960]   - Okay, but I think you know what I mean by that.
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:53.000]   - The Western democracies, that's what you're saying.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:53.840]   - Well, and then also, just my quick question--
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:56.240]   - Western democracies supported the establishment of Israel.
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:58.080]   - My quick question was, you said that you believe that,
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:29:59.000]   this is a very short one, you don't have to,
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.080]   it's just, you think that there's an argument to be made
[02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:02.920]   that the people in Gaza,
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:05.000]   that Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whoever participated,
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.520]   had a just cause for war,
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:07.960]   maybe they didn't do it in the correct way,
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:09.880]   but they maybe had a just cause for war.
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.080]   - I don't think there's a maybe there.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:11.920]   The Palestinians--
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:12.960]   - Okay, you think they absolutely had a just cause for war.
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:14.840]   Do you think that Israel has a just cause
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:16.360]   for Operation Swords of Iron?
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:17.540]   - No, of course not.
[02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:18.380]   - Okay.
[02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:19.200]   - All right.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.080]   - You can say your quote.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:25.080]   - Okay, first of all, on this issue of double standards,
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:30.280]   which is the one that irks or irritates Muin,
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:36.100]   you said that you are not a person of double standards,
[02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:38.960]   unlike people like Muin.
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.920]   You hold high a single standard
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:45.920]   and you condemn deliberate Israeli attacks on--
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:47.040]   - Civilians.
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.680]   - On civilians. - When they occurred, yeah.
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:53.680]   - And I would say that's true for the period up till 1967,
[02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:58.640]   and I think it's accurate,
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:02.220]   your account of the first Intifada.
[02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:05.400]   There, it seems to me, you were in conformity
[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:08.160]   with most mainstream accounts,
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.920]   and the case of the first Intifada,
[02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:13.520]   you also used, surprisingly,
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:17.180]   you used Arab human rights sources like Al-Haq,
[02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:21.400]   which I think Muin worked for during the first Intifada.
[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:22.240]   That's true.
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:27.020]   But then, something very strange happens.
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:28.500]   So let's illustrate it.
[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:30.280]   - Wait, does something strange which happened
[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:31.500]   is the Arabs rejected--
[02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:32.340]   - Okay, wait.
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.100]   - Peace offers, that's what happened.
[02:31:34.100 --> 02:31:35.620]   - By accepting the Oslo Agreement.
[02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:36.460]   - Yeah.
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:39.100]   - By rejecting, he's talking about Camp David and Tata.
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:43.380]   - If we have time, I know the record very well,
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.700]   I'd be very happy to go through it with you,
[02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:48.380]   but let's get to those double standards.
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:50.420]   So, this is what you have to say
[02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:54.500]   about Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
[02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:59.500]   You said Israel was reluctant to harm civilians,
[02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:05.380]   sought to avoid casualties on both sides,
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:11.280]   and took care not to harm Lebanese
[02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:14.700]   and Palestinian civilians.
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:17.260]   You then went on to acknowledge
[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:21.900]   the massive use of IDF firepower against civilians
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:24.300]   during the siege of Beirut,
[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:27.540]   which traumatized Israeli society.
[02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:31.660]   Morris quickly answers the caveat that Israel, quote,
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:36.220]   tried to pinpoint military targets,
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:39.860]   but inevitably many civilians were hit.
[02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:42.860]   That's your description of the Lebanon War.
[02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:47.540]   As I say, that's when I first got involved in the conflict.
[02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:50.300]   I am a voracious reader.
[02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:53.220]   I read everything on the Lebanon War.
[02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:56.620]   I would say there's not a single account
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:33:00.660]   of the Lebanon War in which the estimates are
[02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:05.100]   between 15 and 20,000 Palestinian Lebanese
[02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:07.980]   were killed, overwhelmingly civilians,
[02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:12.380]   the biggest bloodletting until the current Gaza genocide,
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:16.580]   biggest bloodletting.
[02:33:16.580 --> 02:33:21.360]   I would say I can't think of a single mainstream account
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:26.220]   that remotely approximates what you just said.
[02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:29.900]   So leaving aside, I can name the books,
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:32.540]   voluminous, huge volumes.
[02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:34.700]   I'll just take one example.
[02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:35.940]   Now you will remember,
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:38.060]   'cause I think you served in Lebanon in '82.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:39.560]   Am I correct on that?
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:40.740]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:44.780]   So you will remember that Dov Yarmia kept the war diary.
[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:47.420]   So with your permission,
[02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:52.420]   allow me to describe what he wrote during his diary.
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:57.020]   So he writes, "The war machine of the IDF
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:34:01.660]   is galloping and trampling over the conquered territory,
[02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:06.660]   demonstrating a total insensitivity
[02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:10.760]   to the fate of the Arabs who are found in its path.
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:15.420]   A PLO-run hospital suffered a direct hit.
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:18.820]   Thousands of refugees are returning to the city
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.980]   when they arrive at their homes,
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:23.800]   many of which have been destroyed or damaged.
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:26.340]   You hear their cries of pain
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:30.140]   and their howls over the deaths of their loved ones.
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:33.940]   The air is permeated with the smell of corpses.
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:36.500]   Destruction and death are continuing."
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:37.340]   - Point made.
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:38.180]   - Does that--
[02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:39.020]   - The point you're making, actually--
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.580]   - Does that sound like your description
[02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:42.140]   of the Lebanon war?
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:43.380]   - Forget my descriptions.
[02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:44.220]   - Forget it?
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:45.060]   - The point you're making--
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:46.020]   - Words are in print.
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:46.860]   We can't just forget them.
[02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:48.660]   - No, let me just finish my sentence.
[02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:50.380]   The point you're making,
[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:52.140]   which you somehow forget,
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:53.460]   is that there are Israelis
[02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:55.940]   who strongly criticize their own side
[02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:58.580]   and describe how Israelis are doing things
[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:00.400]   which they regard as immoral.
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:02.740]   You don't find that on the Arab side.
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:05.580]   - I'm talking about you, Mr. Morris.
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:07.580]   I'm not talking about Dev Jarmiyahu.
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:10.500]   I'm talking about you, the historian.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:12.660]   How did you depict the Lebanon war?
[02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:15.220]   - 'Cause I believe that the Israeli military
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:17.740]   tried to avoid committing a civilian casualty.
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:18.580]   - So, Dev Jarmiyahu--
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:20.860]   - And I think they've tried to do it in Gaza now.
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:24.180]   - All the attacks by Robert Fisk in Pity the Nation.
[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:27.940]   - Robert Fisk is an anti-Zionist journalist.
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:28.780]   - I know, I know.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:29.600]   - Has always been.
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.600]   - So, that's why you can say with such confidence
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.900]   that you don't condemn deliberate Israeli attacks
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:39.740]   on civilians.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:40.580]   - There weren't any.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:41.400]   - Because there weren't any.
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.380]   - No, I didn't say there weren't any.
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:43.220]   - Yeah, you didn't.
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:45.460]   - And you agreed that I have condemned Israeli attacks
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:46.300]   on civilians.
[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:47.140]   - Yes, there are.
[02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:49.780]   - I never quarrel with facts.
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:54.780]   Your description of the 1982 war is so shocking,
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:57.980]   it makes my innards writhe.
[02:35:57.980 --> 02:36:01.660]   And then your description of the second intifada,
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:04.280]   your description of defensive shield.
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:05.120]   - When the Arabs were bombing--
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:08.700]   - They are worse, they were worse than apologetics.
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:12.660]   - When Arab suicide bombers were destroying Jews
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:15.260]   in masses in buses and in restaurants.
[02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:17.060]   That's the second intifada.
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:17.900]   - You remember that.
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:18.720]   - You can try--
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:21.700]   - Suicide bombers in Jerusalem's buses and restaurants.
[02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:23.620]   - I am completely aware of that.
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:24.460]   - Yes, you will.
[02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:26.260]   - But if you forgot the numbers.
[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:27.100]   - I don't forget.
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:29.340]   - It was three to one.
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:30.180]   The number--
[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:33.140]   - They killed mostly armed Palestinian government.
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:34.660]   - That's what you say in your book.
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:35.500]   - That's what I say.
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:36.340]   That's what I say.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.780]   - But that's not what Amnesty International said.
[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:40.580]   That's not what Human Rights Watch said.
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:41.860]   - I don't remember what they said.
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:42.940]   - I do.
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:43.780]   - No, no.
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:44.600]   - That's not what them.
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:45.820]   - I don't know whether their figures are right.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:46.940]   - My figures are right.
[02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:47.780]   - Listen, listen.
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:48.600]   - In the second intifada--
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:49.440]   - Professor Morris.
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:50.280]   - Some 4,000--
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:51.100]   - Professor Morris.
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:51.940]   - Palestinians were killed.
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:52.780]   - Professor Morris.
[02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:55.660]   - Most of them armed people and the Israelis--
[02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:56.500]   - That's a complete--
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:57.660]   - A thousand Israelis were killed.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.620]   Almost all of them civilians.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.860]   - Professor Morris, fantasy,
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.580]   but I'm not gonna argue with here.
[02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:05.620]   Here's a simple challenge.
[02:37:05.620 --> 02:37:07.120]   You said not to look at the camera.
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:07.960]   - Sometimes.
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:08.780]   - Scares the people.
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:09.980]   I'll make the open challenge.
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.300]   - You are going to scare them.
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:13.380]   - No, Professor Morris.
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:14.220]   - Open challenge.
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:16.140]   The words are in print.
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:21.140]   I wrote 50 pages analyzing all of your work.
[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.540]   I quote, some will say cherry pick,
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:28.060]   but I think accurately quote you.
[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:30.660]   Here's a simple challenge.
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:33.580]   Answer me in print.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:38.260]   Answer what I wrote and show where I'm making things up.
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:39.100]   Answer me in print.
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:39.920]   - I'm not familiar.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:40.760]   I'm sorry.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:41.580]   - Okay.
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:42.420]   - I'm not familiar with what you wrote.
[02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:43.260]   - That's no problem.
[02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:44.080]   You're a busy man.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:45.460]   You're an important historian.
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.260]   You don't have to know everything that's in print,
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:53.060]   especially by modest publishers, but now you know.
[02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:55.740]   And so here's the public challenge.
[02:37:55.740 --> 02:38:00.660]   You answer and show where I cherry picked,
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:02.300]   where I misrepresented.
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:03.140]   - Send me the article.
[02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:03.960]   I will respond.
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.860]   - And then we can have a civil scholarly discussion.
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:09.540]   - I'm not sure we will agree, even if I-
[02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:11.500]   - We don't have to agree.
[02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:15.860]   It's for the reader to decide, looking at both sides,
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:17.220]   where this truth stands.
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:21.300]   - No, and if I may ask, it's good to discuss ideas
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:24.360]   that are in the air now, as opposed to citing literature
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.160]   that was written in the past as much as possible,
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:30.720]   because listeners were not familiar with the literature.
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.000]   So like whatever was written, just express it,
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.640]   condense the key idea, and then we can debate the ideas.
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.120]   - No, there are two aspects.
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.180]   There's a public debate, but there's also written words.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:44.080]   - Yes, I'm just telling you that you,
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:47.520]   as an academic historian, put a lot of value
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.900]   in the written word, and I think it is valuable,
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:50.960]   but in this context-
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:52.520]   - He's incidentally not the only historian
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.880]   who puts value to words.
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:54.720]   I also do, actually.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:56.560]   - Yes, but in this-
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:58.320]   - More than just one or two sentences at a time.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:02.240]   - But in this context, just for the educational purposes,
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:03.080]   teaching people-
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.200]   - The educational purpose is why would people commit
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.720]   what I have to acknowledge, because I am faithful
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:14.040]   to the facts, massive atrocities on October 7th.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.160]   Why did that happen?
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.680]   And I think that's the problem.
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:23.680]   The past is erased, and we suddenly went from 1948
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:29.720]   to October 7th, 2023, and there is a problem there.
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:32.680]   - So first of all, you have complete freedom to backtrack,
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:34.760]   and we'll go there with you.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.720]   Obviously, we can't cover every single year,
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:37.760]   every single event,
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:39.920]   but there's probably critical moments in time.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:41.320]   - Can I respond to something relating to that,
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.160]   the Lebanon War?
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.000]   I looked at the book that he got this from
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.360]   and what the quote was from.
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.800]   It sounds cold to say it, but war is tragic,
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:49.900]   and civilians die.
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:52.320]   There is no war that this has not happened in
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:54.560]   in the history of all of humankind.
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:57.280]   The statement that Israel might take care
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:59.760]   not to target civilians is not incompatible
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.320]   with a diary entry from someone who said
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:03.120]   they saw civilians getting killed.
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.200]   I think that sometimes we do a lot of weird games
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:06.920]   when we talk about international humanitarian law
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.240]   or laws that govern conflict,
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:11.280]   where we say things like civilians dying is a war crime,
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:13.820]   or civilian homes or hospitals getting destroyed
[02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:15.320]   is necessarily a war crime,
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:17.080]   or is necessarily somebody intentionally
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:19.320]   targeting civilians without making distinctions
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:21.640]   between military targets or civilian ones.
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.800]   I think that when we analyze different attacks
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:25.480]   or when we talk about the conduct of the military,
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:27.640]   I think it's important to understand,
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:30.520]   like, prospectively from the unit of analysis
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:33.080]   of the actual military committing the acts,
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:35.240]   what's happening and what are the decisions being made,
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:37.600]   rather than just saying, retrospectively,
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:39.560]   oh, well, a lot of civilians died,
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:42.240]   not very many military people died, comparatively speaking,
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:44.320]   so it must have been war crimes,
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:47.240]   especially when you've got another side,
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:48.500]   I'll fast forward to Hamas,
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:50.480]   that intentionally attempts to induce
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:51.680]   those same civilian numbers,
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:54.200]   because Hamas is guilty of any war crime
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:55.380]   that you would potentially accuse,
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:57.100]   and this is according to Amnesty International,
[02:40:57.100 --> 02:40:58.640]   people that Norm loves to cite,
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:00.540]   Hamas is guilty of all of these same war crimes,
[02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:02.720]   of them failing to take care of the civilian population,
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:04.400]   of them essentially utilizing human shields
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:06.480]   to try to fire rockets, free from attacks.
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:07.720]   - Essentially.
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.680]   - Essentially, yes.
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:10.920]   I'm just saying that, essentially,
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:12.480]   as in terms of how international law defines it,
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:13.760]   not how Amnesty International defines it,
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:14.960]   but Amnesty International describes
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.080]   times of human shielding,
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.040]   but they don't actually apply
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:18.200]   the correct international legal standard.
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:20.520]   - You don't know what's the correct international law.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.660]   You haven't the course.
[02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:22.500]   - I absolutely know, Norm.
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:23.320]   - You haven't the course.
[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:24.160]   - I absolutely do.
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:25.800]   - You can't find it on Wikipedia.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:28.120]   - I'm just saying, believe it or not, Norm,
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:30.200]   the entire Geneva Convention is all on Wikipedia,
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:31.320]   it's a wonderful website.
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:33.120]   But I'm just saying that on the Hamas side,
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:34.600]   if there's an attempt to induce
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:35.760]   this type of military activity,
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:37.240]   attempt to induce civilian harm,
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:38.400]   that it's not just enough to say,
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:40.360]   well, here's a diary entry where a guy talks
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.840]   about how tragic these attacks are.
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:45.960]   - I think the problem with your statement
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:48.280]   is that if you go back and listen to it,
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:52.680]   the first part of it is war is hell, civilians die.
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.600]   It's a fact of life.
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:57.680]   And you state that in a very factual matter.
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:00.760]   Then when you start talking about Hamas,
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:03.380]   all of a sudden you've discovered morality,
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:04.880]   and you've discovered condemnation,
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:06.320]   and you've discovered intent.
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.480]   And you are, unfortunately, far from alone in this.
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:12.880]   I'll give you, you know who for me is a perfect example?
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.720]   - Well, wait, hold on.
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:14.960]   Just a second, we don't need examples.
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:15.800]   - No, go ahead.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:19.320]   - The false equivalency of the two sides is astounding.
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:22.440]   When Hamas kills civilians in a surprise attack
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:25.200]   on October 7th, this isn't because they are attempting
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:26.960]   to target military targets and they happen
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.000]   to stumble into a giant festival of people that--
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.760]   - Well, they did happen to stumble into it.
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:31.600]   - They did, but--
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:32.440]   - And they killed 300 people.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:34.120]   - Yeah, but when they stumbled into it,
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:35.600]   that wasn't an issue of trying to figure out
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:36.520]   a military target or not.
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:38.000]   They weren't failing in distinction.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.800]   There wasn't a proportionality assessment done.
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:41.180]   It was just to kill civilians.
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:44.600]   Even the Amnesty International in 2008 and in 2014,
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:46.080]   and even today will continue to say
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:46.920]   that it's like the types of attacks--
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:49.260]   - I don't think you'll find anyone who will deny
[02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:51.920]   that Hamas has targeted civilians.
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:52.760]   - Sure.
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:53.580]   - You gave the example of--
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:54.420]   - But there's a difference because--
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:57.400]   - Of suicide bombings during the Second Intifada.
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:58.720]   I mean, facts are facts.
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:42:59.560]   - Sure.
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:01.160]   But I'm saying that the Hamas targeting of civilians
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.000]   is different than the incidental loss of life
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.760]   that occurs when Israel does--
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:08.880]   - How, you know, genocide is the intentional mass murder.
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.840]   - Genocide is an entirely separate claim.
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:13.820]   - Yeah, but the idea that Israel is not in the business
[02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:17.320]   of intentionally targeting civilians,
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:19.580]   I know that's what we're supposed to believe,
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:25.360]   but the historical record stands very clearly.
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:26.280]   - I don't believe it does.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:27.120]   - You've written about it yourself.
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:28.240]   - Well, when you say historical,
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.640]   do you mean like in the '40s to the '60s,
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.480]   or do you mean like over the past like--
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:33.920]   - I would say from the '30s of the last century
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:35.920]   to the '20s of this century.
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:38.100]   I'd just like to make, you know,
[02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:41.260]   the way you characterized it,
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:43.520]   I think the best example of that I've come across
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:47.060]   during this specific conflict is John Kirby,
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:48.320]   the White House spokesman.
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:51.960]   I've named him Tears Tostarone for a very good reason.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:57.600]   When he's talking about Palestinian civilian deaths,
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:02.420]   war is hell, you know, it's a fact of life, get used to it.
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:05.720]   When he was confronted with Israeli civilian deaths
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:07.880]   on October 7th, he literally broke down in tears--
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:10.460]   - But he understood that one is deliberate and one isn't.
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:11.300]   He understood that.
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:12.880]   - No, that's what he tried to make us understand.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.440]   - No, no, he was speaking facts.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.560]   The Hamas guys who attacked the kibbutzim,
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:21.280]   apart from the attacks on the military sites,
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:22.720]   when they attacked the kibbutzim,
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:24.520]   were out to kill civilians,
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:26.880]   and they killed family after family,
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:29.680]   house after house, the Israeli attacks
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:31.200]   on the Hamas installations--
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:32.040]   - You know better.
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:33.200]   - I don't know better.
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.880]   No, you don't know Israeli pilots, that's the problem.
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:36.720]   - Thank God.
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:39.240]   - You know, you don't know Israeli pilots.
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:42.440]   They believe that they are killing Hamasniks,
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:43.260]   they're given certain objectives--
[02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:45.340]   - I'm sure they believe it, I'm sure they believe it.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:48.040]   - And if the Hamas is hiding behind civilian,
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:49.920]   civilians die, it's as simple as that.
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.440]   - Every time they target a kid,
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:53.440]   I'm sure they believe it's Hamas.
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:57.680]   - Yeah, when they killed the four kids on the--
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:58.520]   - They believe it.
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:44:59.760]   - Yeah, I know they believe it.
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:00.760]   - Even though they were--
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:01.600]   - You know that.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:02.420]   - Diminutive size.
[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:03.260]   - You know that.
[02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.100]   - Even though they were diminutive--
[02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:04.920]   - In that angle, you don't see the size.
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:05.760]   - No, they saw the size.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:06.580]   - You don't see the size.
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:07.420]   - Let's leave it at that.
[02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:08.600]   - Oh, I know what he's quoting.
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:10.920]   You've lied about this particular instance in the past.
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.640]   Those kids weren't just on the beaches,
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:13.520]   as often stated in articles.
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:14.640]   Those kids were literally coming out
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:17.000]   of a previously identified Hamas compound
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.240]   that they had operated from.
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:19.080]   They literally--
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:22.360]   - Mr. Borelli, Mr. Borelli, with all due respect,
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:25.720]   with all due respect, you're such a fantastic moron.
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:27.120]   It's terrifying.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:32.000]   That wharf was filled with journalists.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.720]   There were tens scores of journalists.
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:40.000]   That was an old fisherman's shack.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.560]   What are you talking about?
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:42.840]   It's so painful.
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:43.680]   - Hamas Naval--
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:46.840]   - It's so painful to listen to this idiocy.
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:48.160]   - And to be clear, on the other side,
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:50.080]   you're implying that a strike was okayed
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:51.400]   on the Israeli side, where they said,
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:53.360]   we're just gonna kill four Palestinian children today
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:54.200]   for no reason.
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:55.040]   - Do you believe that?
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:55.860]   - Do you believe that?
[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:56.700]   Do you believe that?
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:59.400]   As you said, there was a hotel of journalists.
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:00.240]   Do you think that they--
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:02.280]   - Here we go, here we go.
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:03.120]   Here we go.
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:03.940]   - We'll never answer that question.
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:04.780]   - I will answer the question.
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:07.120]   - Pilots will out-kill four children.
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:08.700]   - And it was a proof, because that was a strike.
[02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:09.540]   That was a drone strike.
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.080]   So it was a proof all the way up the chain
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:11.920]   that we're gonna kill children today.
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:12.740]   We're gonna kill Palestinian children today.
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:14.000]   - You want me to answer,
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.060]   or do you want your motor mouth to go?
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:19.000]   Okay, answer.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000]   In 2018, there was the Great March of Return in Gaza.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:29.740]   By all reckonings of human rights organizations
[02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:32.200]   and journalists who were there,
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.000]   it was overwhelmingly nonviolent.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.400]   - But organized by the Hamas.
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:39.360]   - With whoever organized it.
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:40.640]   - It was organized by Satan.
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:41.480]   Let's start with that.
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:42.300]   - Yeah, Hamas.
[02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:43.240]   - Okay, Satan.
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:44.080]   I agree.
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:45.760]   Let's go for the big one.
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:46.600]   The big Megillah.
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:48.600]   It's Satan, okay?
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:52.520]   Overwhelmingly organized, overwhelmingly nonviolent.
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.840]   Resembled at the beginning,
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:54.680]   the first intifada. - They threw bombs here
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:56.000]   and there.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:56.820]   - Represent the first-- - They threw bombs
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:57.660]   here and there, yeah.
[02:46:57.660 --> 02:46:58.800]   - Okay, not bombs.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:46:59.640]   But let's--
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:01.720]   - They tried to make holes in the fence, obviously.
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:02.720]   - Let's continue.
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.840]   - Yeah.
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:04.680]   - So--
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:06.400]   - But I'm not sure Israel behaved morally in that respect.
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:07.440]   - Okay, okay.
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:08.280]   - No, no, no.
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:09.100]   - Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:09.940]   - I'm willing to grant you that.
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:11.440]   - Please, please.
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:12.280]   - I'm willing to grant you that.
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:13.100]   - Allow me to--
[02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:13.940]   - You don't have to pursue it,
[02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:14.760]   'cause I'm willing to grant--
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:15.960]   - Allow me to finish.
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.360]   - I don't know anything about this, I'd like to--
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.520]   - Okay.
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:21.760]   So, as you know,
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:24.120]   along the Gaza perimeter,
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:28.880]   there was Israel's best-trained snipers, correct?
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.400]   - I don't know best-trained, they were snipers.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:31.240]   - Fine.
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:32.060]   - Snipers.
[02:47:32.060 --> 02:47:32.900]   - Okay, all right?
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:33.740]   Because-- - The editorializing--
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.480]   - Hey, laugh, it's hilarious.
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:37.120]   The story's so funny.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:37.960]   - You're lying about--
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:38.780]   - It's so funny. - It's very much
[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:40.080]   in turn had aspects of violence to it.
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:40.920]   - Okay, okay. - Look what even
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:43.520]   the UN says it themselves. - Okay, okay, okay.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.480]   - But you only collect what the UN says that you like.
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:46.880]   - The problem, Mr. Morelli,
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:49.740]   is you don't know the English language.
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:50.580]   You don't--
[02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:51.400]   - I can read from the UN website itself.
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:52.240]   - If you dare, did I say--
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.440]   - In regards to the Great March of Return,
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.280]   they said-- - Please stop
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:55.120]   with your idiotic--
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:55.960]   - While the vast majority of protesters
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:57.120]   have acted in a peaceful manner--
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:57.960]   - No, listen to what he's saying.
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:58.780]   - During most protests,
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:47:59.620]   dozens have approached the fence--
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:00.460]   - If you just agree with me, Mr. Morelli--
[02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:01.300]   - Attempting to damage it--
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:02.120]   - With burning fires-- - Did I say--
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:03.680]   - With burning fires, throwing stones--
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:04.520]   - Overwhelmingly non-violent--
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:06.440]   - And Molotov cocktails towards Israeli forces--
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:07.720]   - Okay. - Applying incendiary
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.560]   kites and balloons-- - All right, all right.
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:09.560]   - Into Israeli territory.
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:10.400]   The latter resulted-- - Yeah, but--
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:11.240]   - In extensive damage-- - Because you don't--
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:12.080]   - To agricultural land-- - Okay.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:13.040]   - And nature reserves-- - Okay.
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.040]   - Inside Israel-- - Okay.
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:14.860]   - And risk the lives-- - Yeah, because--
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:15.700]   - Of Israeli civilians-- - Mr. Morelli--
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:16.540]   - Some instances-- - Mr. Morelli--
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:17.360]   - Of shooting and throwing-- - Mr. Morelli--
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:18.200]   - Of explosives-- - Yeah.
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.680]   - And also-- - Talk fast, talk fast.
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:20.520]   - I'm just trying to-- - So people think
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:21.340]   that you're coherent.
[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:22.180]   - I'm just reading from the UN.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:23.020]   - Okay, yeah, but you see--
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:23.840]   - I know you like them-- - You got, you got--
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:24.680]   - Sometimes, only when they-- - You got the months--
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:25.520]   - Agree with you, though.
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.760]   - You got the months wrong, you got the months wrong.
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:32.200]   We're talking about the beginning in March 30th, 2018.
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:34.420]   - You just described that March as mostly peaceful.
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:36.080]   - Okay, okay, allow me to finish.
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.480]   So there were the snipers, okay?
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.480]   Now, you find it so far-fetched,
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.480]   Israelis purposely, deliberately targeting civilians?
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:49.000]   That's such a far-fetched idea.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.080]   An overwhelmingly non-violent march.
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:54.640]   What did the international--
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:55.920]   - It wasn't a march, it was a campaign--
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:56.760]   - Yeah, whatever you wanna call it--
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:58.040]   - Which went on for months.
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:58.880]   - Whatever you wanna call it.
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:48:59.880]   - For months. - Yeah.
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:02.320]   What did the UN investigation find?
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:04.280]   - Well, he just read a few-- - It found...
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.080]   I read the report.
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:09.680]   I don't read things off of those machines.
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:11.600]   I read the report.
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:13.200]   What did it find?
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.280]   Brace yourself, you thought it was so funny,
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:20.280]   the idea of IDF targeting civilians.
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.200]   It found, go look this up on your machine.
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:25.120]   I already know what you're gonna say.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.400]   You're gonna say it found that only one or two of them
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:29.720]   were justified killings. - Targeted children.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.200]   Targeted journalists, targeted medics,
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:36.760]   and here's the funniest one of all.
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:38.880]   It's so hilarious.
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:41.280]   They targeted disabled people
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:46.280]   who were 300 meters away from the fence
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:49.400]   and just standing by trees.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:50.320]   - If this is true, if what you're saying is true--
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:51.760]   - If it's true.
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:53.360]   - By the way, just quick pause.
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:56.720]   I think everything was fascinating to listen to
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:58.240]   except the mention of hilarious.
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:49:59.920]   Nobody finds any of this hilarious.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:02.600]   And if any of us are laughing,
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:04.560]   it's not at the suffering of civilians
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:05.960]   or suffering of anyone.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.280]   It's at the obvious joyful camaraderie in the room.
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:12.600]   So I'm enjoying it and also the joy of learning.
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:13.520]   So thank you.
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.080]   - Can we talk about the targeting civilian thing
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:15.920]   a little bit?
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:17.640]   I think there's like an important underlying,
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:18.480]   not necessarily that,
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:20.080]   I just, I think it's important to understand.
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:21.440]   Yeah, I think it's important to understand
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:22.440]   that there's like three different things here
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:23.280]   that we need to think about.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:25.880]   So one is a policy of killing civilians.
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:27.720]   Do we, so I would ask the other side,
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:28.560]   I'm gonna ask all three
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:29.760]   'cause I know there won't be a short answer.
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:31.920]   Do you think there is a policy top down
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:33.240]   from the IDF to target civilians?
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:34.240]   That's one thing.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:35.560]   A second thing is--
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:36.400]   - He said yes.
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:37.520]   - Yeah, sure, okay, yeah.
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:38.360]   That's fine, okay.
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:39.920]   But then the second thing is,
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:41.600]   or there's two distinctions I wanna draw between.
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:43.000]   I think Benny would say this.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.400]   I would say this.
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:47.360]   I'm sure undoubtedly there have been cases
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:50.120]   where IDF soldiers for no good reason
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:52.040]   have targeted and killed Palestinians
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:53.240]   that they should not have done,
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:55.200]   that would it be prosecutable as war crimes
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:56.040]   as defined by the Rome Statute--
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:57.600]   - And some have been prosecuted.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:50:58.440]   - Yeah, and I'm absolutely sure--
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:50:59.280]   - According to you--
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:00.120]   - Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:00.960]   - Or practically none.
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:01.800]   - I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:03.560]   - According to you and your book, practically none.
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:05.440]   - I'm sure that we would all agree for soldiers
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:06.280]   if that happens.
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:08.520]   But I think that it's important,
[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:09.360]   I think that it's important
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:11.200]   that when we talk about military strikes,
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.160]   or we talk about things especially involving bombings
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:14.360]   or drone attacks,
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:15.760]   these are things that are signed off
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:18.200]   by multiple different layers of command
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:20.160]   by multiple people involved in an operation,
[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:21.280]   including intelligence gathering,
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:22.280]   including weaponeering,
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:24.440]   and there also have typically lawyers involved.
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:25.680]   When you make the claim
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:28.520]   that an IDF soldier shot a Palestinian,
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:29.840]   those three people, the three hostages
[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:30.680]   that came up with white flags
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:31.760]   and something horrible happened,
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:33.000]   I think that's a fair statement to make.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.560]   And I think a lot of criticism is deserved.
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:35.440]   But when you make the statement
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:38.080]   that four children were killed by a strike,
[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:39.320]   the claim that you're making--
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:40.160]   - Deliberately, yeah.
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:41.200]   - The claim that you're making,
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:42.040]   the claim that you're making
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:44.080]   is that multiple levels of the IDF
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:46.040]   signed off on just killing--
[02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:46.880]   - I have no idea what--
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:48.560]   - That's great, if you don't understand the process,
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:49.400]   then let me educate you.
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:51.080]   I can tell you, I do understand the process.
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:51.920]   I'm telling you.
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:52.760]   I'm trying to explain to you right now.
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:53.600]   - You're in the IDF?
[02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:54.920]   - No, it's basic military.
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:56.120]   You can ask anybody that's talked about--
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:57.600]   - Aside from Wikipedia,
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:51:58.440]   can you tell me what your knowledge of the IDF is?
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:51:59.280]   - Yes, you can talk to people,
[02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:01.680]   you can talk to people who work in the military.
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:03.040]   - What's your knowledge of the IDF?
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:03.880]   - Your audience can look this up.
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:06.280]   Do you think that bombing and strikes
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:08.320]   are decided by one person in the field?
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:09.160]   Do you think one person--
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:10.000]   - Can I respond to this?
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:10.840]   - Can I respond to this?
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:11.680]   - What he's trying to tell you
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:14.400]   is that strikes themselves have entire apparatuses
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:16.440]   that are designed to figure out how to strike
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:17.280]   and who to strike.
[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:19.320]   So when you say that four children are targeted,
[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:20.920]   you're saying that a whole apparatus
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:23.360]   is trying to murder four Palestinian children.
[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:24.200]   - You make my argument better than me.
[02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:25.800]   - Which is a ridiculous argument.
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:30.000]   - Or really, that it's impossible at the command level.
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.200]   It's impossible at the command level.
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:34.760]   But you said that they couldn't have done it at the bottom
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:36.240]   if it weren't also at the top.
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:37.560]   - You don't understand the strength
[02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:39.040]   of the claim that you're making.
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:40.960]   You're saying that from a top-down level
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:41.800]   that lawyers, multiple commanders--
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:43.280]   - With all due respect, Mr. Bernal,
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:45.760]   do not tell me what I don't understand.
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:46.880]   - Or Palestinians.
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:48.520]   - It's true, it's true.
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:50.920]   I don't spend my nights on Wikipedia.
[02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:51.960]   I read books.
[02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:53.560]   I admit that as a signal--
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:54.400]   - It's a waste of time.
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:57.200]   - Yeah, as I know, books are a waste of time.
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:02.200]   With all due regard, I completely respect the fact,
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:06.720]   and I'll say it on the air,
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:11.080]   as much as I find totally disgusting
[02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:13.360]   what's come of your politics,
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:16.360]   a lot of the books are excellent.
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:19.920]   And I'll even tell you, because I'm not afraid of saying it,
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:22.800]   whenever I have to check on a basic fact,
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:25.680]   the equivalent of going to the Britannica,
[02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:27.200]   I go to your books.
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:29.240]   I know you got a lot of the facts right.
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:30.680]   - Benny Moore's books for the listener.
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:34.960]   - I would never say books are a waste of time,
[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:37.040]   and it's regrettable to you
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:39.520]   that you got strapped with a partner
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:42.600]   who thinks that all the wisdom, all the wisdom--
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.000]   - He didn't say they're a waste of time.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:47.600]   - I'd like to respond to what you were saying.
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:53.520]   I think the question that we're trying to answer,
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:54.360]   I think--
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:55.720]   - I think you don't understand Israel, you know?
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:56.560]   - Let me finish, please.
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:57.680]   - Neither really understands Israel.
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:53:58.520]   - I think we're all--
[02:53:58.520 --> 02:53:59.360]   - Now it works.
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:00.960]   - I think we're all agreed
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:05.800]   that Palestinians have deliberately targeted civilians.
[02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:09.440]   Whether we're talking about Hamas and Islamic Jihad today,
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:10.280]   or previously--
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:13.600]   - I prefer the word murdered and raped rather than targeted.
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:16.040]   Targeted is too soft for what the Hamas did.
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:16.880]   - I'm okay with that.
[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:18.360]   - I'm not talking about--
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:19.280]   - I'm talking about this now.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:21.600]   - Yeah, but I'm trying to answer his question.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:23.000]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.280]   - Historically, there is substantial evidence
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:31.560]   that Palestinians have targeted civilians.
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:34.760]   Whether it's been incidental or systematic
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:35.720]   is a different discussion.
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:37.640]   I don't want to get into that now.
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:40.760]   For some reason, there seems to be a huge debate
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:45.240]   about whether any Israeli has ever sunk so low
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:47.400]   as to target a civilian.
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:48.240]   I don't--
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:49.080]   - No, we've agreed, both said that--
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:49.920]   - We just agreed--
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:51.280]   - We've just said that this has happened here and there.
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:52.120]   - And I think--
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:52.960]   - We've agreed on that.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:54.040]   - I think--
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:55.720]   - What we're saying is it's not policy,
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:54:57.400]   which is what you guys are implying,
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:54:59.400]   that they kill civilians deliberately.
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:01.800]   - If I understand you correctly,
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:04.240]   you're basically making the claim
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:06.920]   that none of these attacks could have happened
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.400]   without going through an entire chain of command.
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:11.440]   - Strike cells that are involved in like drone attacks--
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:12.280]   - Yes.
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:13.120]   - Or plane attacks or--
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.240]   - My understanding of the Israeli military,
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:18.600]   and you could perhaps, you've served in it,
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:20.040]   you would know better.
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.320]   It's actually a fairly chaotic organization.
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:24.680]   - No, no, that's not true, especially not the Air Force.
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:26.920]   It's extremely, extremely organized.
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:29.760]   The Air Force works in a very organized fashion,
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:32.720]   as he says, with lawyers, a chain of command,
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:34.640]   and ultimately the pilot drops the bomb
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:35.480]   where he's told to drop it.
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:36.440]   - Was it an effective edge?
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:39.640]   Was that 200 strikes in like 60 seconds, I think?
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:41.520]   I think at the opening of protective edge?
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:42.360]   Like the, yeah, the coordination between--
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:44.920]   - You're talking about 2008.
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:46.720]   - I think the protective edge was 2014,
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:48.280]   but I'm just saying that the coordination in the military
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:49.120]   is pretty tight.
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:52.080]   - Well, my understanding of the Israeli military--
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:52.920]   - It's very organized.
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:54.960]   - Is that it's quite chaotic,
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:58.480]   and there's also a lot of testimonies from Israel,
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:00.040]   but be that as it may.
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:04.480]   Okay, I'm prepared to accept both of your contentions,
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:08.840]   that it's a highly organized and disciplined force.
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:10.440]   Air Force, under any scenario,
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:13.200]   is going to be more organized than the other branches,
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:14.800]   and you're saying such a strike
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:16.520]   would have been inconceivable.
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:18.200]   - Well, I'm not necessarily saying inconceivable.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:19.640]   I'm just saying that like that would have required
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:22.400]   like murderous intent from somebody below.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:23.480]   I don't think good evidence has been presented
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:24.320]   to say that that's the case.
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:28.160]   - Your basic claim is that it would be fair to assume
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:30.480]   that such a strike could have only been carried out
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:35.480]   with multiple levels of authorization and signing off.
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:38.760]   Okay, let's accept that for the sake of argument.
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:44.960]   We have now seen incident after incident
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:47.320]   after incident after incident
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:52.320]   where entire families are vaporized in single strikes.
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:53.440]   Who is in the families?
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:54.880]   Who lives in the house?
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:55.960]   - Family members. - Inside?
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:57.600]   No, or next to the house. - Family members.
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:56:59.200]   - In which these families are killed.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:00.920]   - We have seen incident after-
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:03.440]   - Do you know that Hamasniks weren't in that house?
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:05.320]   Do you know that their ammunition dumps
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:06.240]   weren't in those houses? - Why do I have
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:07.440]   to prove a negative?
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:10.640]   - You are saying that they deliberately targeted families.
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.240]   If Israel wanted to kill civilians in Gaza,
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:17.000]   they could have killed 500,000 by now
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.400]   with the number of strikes they've done.
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:19.240]   - And therefore- - And the fact
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:21.960]   that they've only killed a certain small number-
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:23.440]   - 30,000 is a small number.
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.280]   - Small number in proportion.
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:25.400]   - You consider 30,000 a small number.
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:28.200]   - Small number in proportion over four months
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:31.720]   probably is an indication that it's targeted
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:34.640]   and that there are Hamas targets in these places.
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:38.680]   - So I've given- - 12,000 children is only.
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:40.760]   And if that's the case, why is it-
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:43.160]   - Did I use the word only? - Yeah, you said only.
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:44.240]   Only.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.120]   Though, Professor Maroz, here's a question for you.
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:51.160]   If we take every combat zone in the world
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:54.680]   for the past three years, every combat zone in the world-
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:56.800]   - In Vietnam, the Americans killed a million people.
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:57.640]   - I'm not talking about Vietnam.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:57:58.840]   - Well, they could have killed 40 million.
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:01.800]   - I wasn't, yeah, I was in the anti-war movement.
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:03.160]   So don't distract me- - The Americans killed
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:04.000]   a million people in Vietnam.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.280]   - Fine, fine.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:09.760]   And 30 million Russians were killed during World War II,
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:11.440]   so everything else is irrelevant.
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:12.280]   Okay.
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:14.000]   - Not everything's relevant. - Here's a question.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.040]   - Stick to proportionality. - Professor Maroz,
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:18.840]   here's a question, it's very perplexing.
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:22.160]   If you take every combat zone in the world
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:24.680]   for the past three years,
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:29.040]   and you multiply the number of children killed
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:32.720]   by four, every combat zone in the world,
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:36.560]   you get Gaza, okay?
[02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:38.360]   So when you say- - What is that supposed to prove?
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:39.840]   - Okay, I'm gonna tell you- - Wait, wait, firstly,
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:40.800]   you're relying- - Just shut up.
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:42.760]   - You're relying on Hamas numbers.
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:43.960]   - No, I'm not relying- - Hamas numbers
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:45.240]   are not necessarily true. - I'm relying on the numbers
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:47.400]   that everybody else, I'm relying on the numbers-
[02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:48.360]   - Even though we take the numbers, though,
[02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:49.200]   what does that prove?
[02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:50.760]   - Those are Hamas numbers. - Okay, okay, okay.
[02:58:50.760 --> 02:58:52.080]   - Which may not be true. - Fine, fine.
[02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:53.680]   - They could invent anything,
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:56.920]   'cause you know that they are a mendacious organization.
[02:58:56.920 --> 02:58:58.760]   - I know mendacious, believe me.
[02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:00.440]   - You like words, mendacious. - Mendacious as in-
[02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:01.960]   - Mendacious organization. - The Israeli Ministry
[02:59:01.960 --> 02:59:03.440]   of Foreign Affairs.
[02:59:03.440 --> 02:59:05.280]   Okay, so here's the thing.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:09.040]   You say they could have killed 500,000,
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:11.480]   but they only killed only, that's your word.
[02:59:11.480 --> 02:59:13.520]   - I'm saying that- - They only killed 30,000.
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:16.760]   - If you believe that they deliberately target civilians,
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:18.960]   they would have killed many, many more.
[02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:22.000]   The fact is that they don't deliberately target civilians.
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.400]   - Professor Morris, for a historian-
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:26.440]   - And you don't understand- - For a historian,
[02:59:26.440 --> 02:59:28.560]   I don't wanna understand Israeli society.
[02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:30.480]   If you wanna know the truth, I don't want to.
[02:59:30.480 --> 02:59:31.760]   I don't wanna get inside their heads.
[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:32.600]   - That's the problem.
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:36.080]   - 90% of Israelis- - A good historian,
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:38.600]   a good historian tries to get into the heads
[02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:40.720]   of the various protagonists. - There's a limit,
[02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:41.920]   there's a limit.
[02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:45.200]   When 90% of Israelis think
[02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:50.200]   that Israel's using enough or too little force in Gaza,
[02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:52.400]   I don't wanna get inside that head.
[02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:57.400]   40% think that Israel's using insufficient force in Gaza.
[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:00.240]   I don't wanna get inside that head.
[03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:02.080]   I don't wanna get inside the head of people
[03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:04.880]   who think they're using insufficient force-
[03:00:04.880 --> 03:00:07.320]   - Historians must understand. - Against the population,
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:10.400]   against the population, half of which is children.
[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:13.120]   I don't wanna get inside that head.
[03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:14.360]   But here's the point,
[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:18.320]   because your partner wants to know the point.
[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:22.240]   You don't understand political constraints.
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.720]   One of your ministers said,
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:26.280]   let's drop an atomic bomb on Gaza.
[03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:27.600]   - Do you think he really meant that?
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:29.480]   - He said it through you. - No, no, no, no.
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:31.480]   It was said in a sort of a- - Professor Morris.
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:32.920]   - Questionable way. - He said it the day after.
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:33.760]   - He didn't say they should drop an atomic bomb.
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:34.600]   - Professor Morris. - He said it-
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:35.440]   - The day after the Israeli attack.
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:36.280]   - I'm not supporting he's an idiot.
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:38.320]   - Professor Morris, none other- - This minister is a-
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:41.000]   - None other- - This minister is a messianic idiot.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.080]   - None other than Israel's- - But he didn't say
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:46.280]   drop an atomic bomb on- - None other than Israel's
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:51.280]   chief historian, the famed, justifiably famed, Benny Morris,
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:56.640]   thinks we should be dropping nuclear weapons on Iran.
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:58.920]   - Iran has for years, its leaders for years
[03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:00.880]   have said we should destroy Israel.
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:02.480]   You agree with that?
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:04.240]   They've said we should destroy Israel.
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:05.680]   Israel must be destroyed.
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:07.520]   Is that correct?
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:08.800]   This is what the Iranian leaders
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:10.040]   have been saying since Khomeini.
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:13.200]   - I would say Iranian leaders have sent mixed messages.
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.280]   - Okay, okay, but some of them have said,
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:16.880]   including Khamenei and Khomeini.
[03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:18.320]   - If you don't know their evidence,
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:19.520]   if you don't know their evidence,
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:20.600]   why are you laughing? - This is like a skepticism,
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:21.440]   it's very funny.
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:22.720]   - It's funny because- - Iran doesn't support
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:24.680]   Hezbollah and the Houthis and Hamas
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:25.520]   even if they want Israel destroyed.
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:26.360]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:27.680]   - Embrace yourself. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:28.520]   - To the extent- - It's complicated.
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:30.320]   - That the Houthis are trying- - It's complicated.
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:32.320]   - To the extent that the Houthis are trying
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:34.200]   to stop the genocide in Gaza.
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:35.040]   - There is no genocide. - I support-
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:35.860]   - There is no genocide. - I support-
[03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:36.700]   - They are the right- - I support-
[03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:37.540]   - To attack civilian ships. - I support-
[03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:38.360]   - I know you selectively- - I support the Houthis.
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:40.100]   - Support international law- - There's no genocide.
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:41.520]   - When it agrees with you. - I support, okay.
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:42.360]   - And then when it doesn't,
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:43.180]   you decide to throw international law to the wind.
[03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:45.800]   - There's no genocide in Gaza. - If you like, if you like-
[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:46.640]   - Hold on a second, Norm, Norm.
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:49.800]   - Let me read what you said. - Norm, Norm, stop, please.
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:52.440]   Norm, just for me, please, just give me a second.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:54.680]   You said that there's no genocide going on in Gaza.
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:56.520]   Let me ask that clear question.
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.200]   The same question I asked on the Hamas attacks.
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:02.720]   Is there, from a legal, philosophical, moral perspective,
[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:05.420]   is there genocide going on in Gaza today?
[03:02:05.420 --> 03:02:09.120]   - Is there a genocide going on in Gaza?
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.880]   Well, in several years,
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:12.440]   we will have a definitive response-
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:14.120]   - But at the moment- - To that question.
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:18.660]   What has happened thus far is that on the 29th of December,
[03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:22.120]   the Republic of South Africa instituted
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:26.080]   proceedings against Israel,
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:29.880]   pursuant to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:32.300]   and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
[03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:36.840]   South Africa basically accused Israel
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:41.560]   of perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip.
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:44.000]   On the 26th of January,
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:50.480]   the court issued its initial ruling.
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:52.500]   The court, at this stage,
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:58.400]   is not making a determination on whether Israel has
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:01.280]   or has not committed genocide.
[03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:04.800]   So just as it has not found Israel guilty,
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:08.280]   it certainly also hasn't found Israel innocent.
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:11.360]   What the court had to do at this stage
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:13.480]   was take one of two decisions.
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:18.480]   Either South Africa's case was the equivalent
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:21.480]   of a frivolous lawsuit and dismiss it
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:23.280]   and close the proceedings,
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:27.760]   or it had to determine that South Africa
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:30.160]   presented a plausible case
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.040]   that Israel was violating its obligations
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:36.040]   under the Genocide Convention,
[03:03:36.040 --> 03:03:40.280]   and that it would, on that basis, hold a full hearing.
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:45.280]   Now, a lot of people have looked at the court's ruling
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:50.320]   of the 26th of January and focused on the fact
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:52.820]   that the court did not order a ceasefire.
[03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:56.040]   I actually wasn't expecting it to order a ceasefire,
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:57.920]   and I wasn't surprised that it didn't
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:02.120]   because in the other cases that the court has considered,
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:06.080]   most prominently Bosnia and Myanmar,
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:08.060]   it also didn't order a ceasefire.
[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:13.120]   And South Africa, in requesting a ceasefire,
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:16.700]   also didn't ask the court to render an opinion
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:18.960]   on the legitimacy or lack thereof
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:22.760]   of Israel's military operation.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.760]   From my perspective, the key issue on the 26th of January
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:31.520]   was whether the court would simply dismiss the case
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:33.360]   or decide to proceed with it.
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:34.960]   - And it decided to proceed.
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:35.960]   - And it decided to proceed.
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:37.520]   And I think that's enormously--
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:38.360]   - I thought that was--
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:39.200]   - I think that's enormously significant.
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:40.760]   - But you said they committed genocide.
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:42.520]   You already said they committed genocide.
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:43.360]   - I also--
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:44.440]   - It's committing genocide.
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.280]   - But if I could just--
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:47.600]   - Allow me, allow me--
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:48.440]   - Use that word.
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.720]   - That's correct.
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:50.540]   - Now--
[03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:51.380]   - I don't run away from--
[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:52.960]   - No, you did say Israel is committing genocide.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:54.280]   - Can you let Moyad finish?
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:57.000]   - Well, the end of the story is you specifically asked
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.680]   whether I think Israel is committing genocide.
[03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:02.600]   I explained formally there is no finding.
[03:05:02.600 --> 03:05:06.520]   And as you said, we won't know for a number of years.
[03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:08.580]   And I think there's legitimate questions to be raised.
[03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:09.920]   I mean, in the Bosnia case,
[03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:11.840]   which I think all four of us would agree
[03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:14.280]   was clearly a case of genocide,
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:15.640]   the court determined--
[03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:16.480]   - I mean, by the Serbs.
[03:05:16.480 --> 03:05:17.420]   - Yes.
[03:05:17.420 --> 03:05:20.440]   And in the Bosnia case, the court determined
[03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:23.160]   that of all the evidence placed before them,
[03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:26.020]   only Srebrenica qualified as genocide.
[03:05:26.020 --> 03:05:28.600]   And all the other atrocities committed
[03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:31.040]   did not qualify as genocide.
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:34.300]   You know, international law is a developing organism.
[03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:39.240]   I don't know how the court is going to respond in this case.
[03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:42.880]   So I wouldn't take it as a foregone conclusion
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:44.320]   how the court is going to respond.
[03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:46.160]   - But Norman has determined already.
[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:48.600]   - I have too, because you're asking my personal opinion.
[03:05:48.600 --> 03:05:49.640]   - Personal opinion is also--
[03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:53.280]   - So as a matter of law, I want to state very clearly,
[03:05:53.280 --> 03:05:55.040]   it has not been determined
[03:05:55.040 --> 03:05:57.160]   and won't be determined for several years.
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:02.160]   Based on my observations and the evidence before me,
[03:06:02.160 --> 03:06:07.560]   I would say it's indisputable
[03:06:07.560 --> 03:06:11.100]   that Israel is engaged in a genocidal assault
[03:06:11.100 --> 03:06:12.860]   against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.
[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:14.160]   - Which is the PLO line.
[03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:17.840]   - Yeah, with the program, the PLO is long past--
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:20.280]   - Okay, the Palestinian Authority.
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:25.280]   - As you were saying, genocide is not a body count.
[03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:30.640]   Genocide consists of two elements,
[03:06:30.640 --> 03:06:34.980]   the destruction of a people in whole or in part.
[03:06:34.980 --> 03:06:37.200]   So in other words, you can commit genocide
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:38.960]   by killing 30,000 people.
[03:06:38.960 --> 03:06:41.280]   It doesn't have, well, five probably is below the threshold.
[03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:42.520]   - There is a problem of numbers.
[03:06:42.520 --> 03:06:46.160]   - Yes, but I think 30,000 crosses the threshold
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:49.480]   and not reaching 500,000 is probably relevant.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:52.640]   And the second element is there has to be an intent.
[03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:53.960]   In other words--
[03:06:53.960 --> 03:06:55.120]   - And you believe there's an intent?
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:59.760]   - Yes, I think if there is any other plausible reason
[03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:02.780]   for why all these people are being murdered,
[03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:04.320]   it's not genocide.
[03:07:04.320 --> 03:07:05.520]   And as far as intent is--
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:08.040]   - What about hiding behind a human shield?
[03:07:08.040 --> 03:07:09.960]   You don't think that's a reason for them being killed?
[03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:13.040]   - Well, let's get the intent part out of the way first.
[03:07:13.040 --> 03:07:14.640]   South Africa's--
[03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:16.160]   - Forget South Africa, they're not the party.
[03:07:16.160 --> 03:07:17.320]   - Well, I'd like to finish.
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:19.560]   - They're just pro-Hamas government.
[03:07:19.560 --> 03:07:20.880]   That's got nothing to do with anything.
[03:07:20.880 --> 03:07:23.040]   - I think they're pro-Satan as well last time I checked.
[03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:24.240]   - No, they're pro-Hamas.
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:27.160]   - You know, for some reason, you don't have a problem
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:31.000]   with people being pro-Israeli at the time of this.
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:35.080]   But if they support Palestinians' right to life
[03:07:35.080 --> 03:07:37.400]   or self-determination, they get demonized
[03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:38.240]   and delegitimized as pro-Hamas.
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:39.080]   - Not because of that.
[03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:40.160]   Because they supported an organization
[03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:42.360]   which murdered 1,200 people deliberately.
[03:07:42.360 --> 03:07:43.200]   That's my problem.
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:45.200]   - They're supporting a state that has murdered 30,000.
[03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:47.320]   - But they haven't, because these 30,000
[03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:50.280]   are basically human shields used by the Hamas,
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.960]   in which the Hamas wanted killed.
[03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:54.400]   They wanted them killed.
[03:07:54.400 --> 03:07:55.800]   Hamas wanted these people killed.
[03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:56.640]   - If I could just get--
[03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:58.200]   - You don't think they wanted them killed?
[03:07:58.200 --> 03:07:59.040]   - No, I don't.
[03:07:59.040 --> 03:07:59.880]   - They didn't provide them with shelters.
[03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:01.880]   They build tunnels for their fighters,
[03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:04.360]   but not one shelter for their own civilians.
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:05.480]   - You asked me about intent.
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:06.320]   - Of course they want them killed.
[03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:08.280]   - Okay, you asked me about intent.
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:11.360]   And the reason that I bought in the South African
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:14.520]   application is because it is actually
[03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:19.520]   exceptionally detailed on intent by quoting numerous--
[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:21.280]   - All sorts of idiotic ministers in Israel.
[03:08:21.280 --> 03:08:23.280]   - Well, yeah, including the prime minister,
[03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:24.120]   the defense minister--
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:25.200]   - I mean, the prime minister didn't say kill--
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:26.040]   - The chief of staff--
[03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:27.040]   - Didn't say genocide, the chief of staff--
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:27.880]   - No, he said Amalek.
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:28.720]   - According to Asa Kasher--
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:29.560]   - He said Amalek.
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:30.400]   - Use the word Amalek--
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:31.240]   - According to Asa Kasher--
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:33.160]   - Because the Hamas are a really evil organization.
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:34.240]   - According to Asa Kasher--
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:35.240]   - If I may.
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:38.720]   - According to Asa Kasher, the philosopher of the IDF--
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:39.560]   - Asa Kasher, yeah.
[03:08:39.720 --> 03:08:44.720]   - He said that Netanyahu was vowing genocide.
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:46.200]   Now he's an idiot?
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:47.040]   - So the point--
[03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:49.080]   - He didn't say he's an idiot, but he just passed it.
[03:08:49.080 --> 03:08:52.280]   - So the reason I raised the South African application
[03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:54.520]   is twofold, Hamas or no Hamas.
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:59.280]   It's exceptionally detailed on the question of intent.
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:03.400]   And secondly, when the International Court of Justice
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:08.400]   issues a ruling, individual justices have the right--
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:10.480]   - Can give their own opinion.
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:13.280]   And I found the German one to be the most interesting
[03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:17.840]   on this specific question because he was basically saying
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:20.200]   that he didn't think South Africa
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:22.800]   presented a persuasive case.
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:27.800]   But he said their section on intent was so overpowering
[03:09:27.800 --> 03:09:32.880]   that he felt he was left with no choice
[03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:34.680]   but to vote with the majority.
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:38.400]   So I think that answers the intent part of your question.
[03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:41.480]   - So for the ICJ case that South Africa's brought,
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:43.160]   I think there's a couple things that need to be mentioned.
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:46.640]   One is, and I saw you two talk at length about this,
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:49.360]   the plausibility standard is incredibly low.
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:50.480]   The only thing we're looking for
[03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:52.040]   is a basic presentation of facts
[03:09:52.040 --> 03:09:55.200]   that make it conceivable, possible, that--
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:56.040]   - Plausible.
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:09:59.280]   - Plausible, which legally this is obviously
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:01.080]   below criminal conviction, below--
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:01.920]   - Yes, of course.
[03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:02.760]   - Yeah, below--
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.200]   - Think of it as an indictment.
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:06.880]   - Sure, possibly, maybe even at a lower level
[03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:08.000]   than even an indictment.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:11.320]   So plausibility is an incredibly low standard, number one.
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:13.920]   Number two, if you actually go through
[03:10:13.920 --> 03:10:17.720]   and you read the complaint that South Africa filed,
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:21.040]   I would say that if you go through the quotes
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:23.760]   and you even follow through to the source of the quotes,
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:26.320]   the misrepresentation that South Africa does
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:28.960]   and their case about all of these horrendous quotes,
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:31.360]   in my opinion, borders on criminal.
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:33.520]   - Well, 16 ICJ judges disagree.
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:35.760]   - That's fine if 16 ICJ judges disagree,
[03:10:35.760 --> 03:10:36.600]   but I'm gonna give-- - They must be
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:38.000]   awful incompetent.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:38.840]   - You know, they could be, but--
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:41.640]   - They must be, or even the American judge,
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:44.680]   she must have been awful incompetent
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:49.280]   if she was unable to see the misrepresentations
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:52.680]   that Mr. Burnell, based on his Wikipedia entry,
[03:10:52.680 --> 03:10:53.520]   was able to find.
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:56.240]   - So this is based on the official ICJ report
[03:10:56.240 --> 03:10:57.080]   that was released?
[03:10:57.080 --> 03:10:58.320]   I'm not sure if you read the entire thing or not.
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:00.160]   - I read every aspect. - Okay, that's great.
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:01.640]   Did you go through and actually identify
[03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:03.120]   any of the sources for the underlying quotes?
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:05.040]   - Actually, brace yourself for this,
[03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:06.720]   and Muin could confirm it.
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:12.400]   Yaniv Kogan, an Israeli, and Jamie Sternweiner,
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:17.400]   half-Israeli, they checked every single quote
[03:11:17.400 --> 03:11:22.080]   in the Hebrew original, and Yaniv Kogan,
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:27.080]   love the guy, he has terrifying powers of concentration,
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:30.600]   he checked every single quote.
[03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:32.160]   Is that correct, Muin?
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:35.000]   And Jamie checked every single quote
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.400]   in the English, in the context,
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:42.440]   and where there were any contextual questions,
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:43.280]   they told us.
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:44.320]   - I think they found one?
[03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:45.960]   - Yeah, I think they found one.
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:50.960]   So I do not believe that those 15 judges,
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:53.800]   it was 15 to two.
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:55.560]   - 16 to two, I think.
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:57.480]   - They're 15 in the court plus two,
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:59.680]   so it's 17, so it's 15 to two.
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:05.400]   I don't think those 15 judges were incompetent,
[03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:11.280]   and I certainly don't believe the president of the court,
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:16.960]   an American, would allow herself to be duped.
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:19.320]   - Okay, well, let me read it.
[03:12:19.320 --> 03:12:22.880]   - You might recall, Mr. Lebreau, Mr. Lebreau.
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:24.440]   - All right, let him read.
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:28.400]   - Sure, so this was taken from the South African complaint.
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:30.880]   There's tons of these, but so here's one.
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:33.360]   In the complaint for the ICJ, they said
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:35.560]   that on the 12th of October, 2023,
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:38.240]   President Isaac Herzog made clear
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:39.960]   that Israel was not distinguishing
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:42.720]   between militants and civilians in Gaza,
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:44.840]   stating in a press conference to foreign media
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:46.960]   in relation to Palestinians in Gaza,
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:48.680]   over one million of whom are children,
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:52.440]   quote, quote, "It's an entire nation out there
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:53.680]   "that is responsible.
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:56.320]   "It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:12:57.680]   "not aware, not involved."
[03:12:57.680 --> 03:12:59.840]   - I saw that. - It's absolutely not true,
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:03.720]   and we will fight until we break their backbone, end quote.
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:05.680]   If you actually go to the news article
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:08.720]   that they even state, they even link it in their complaint,
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:10.720]   the full context for the quote was,
[03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:12.880]   quote, "It is an entire nation out there
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:14.000]   "that is responsible.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:15.840]   "It's not true, this rhetoric about civilians
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:17.240]   "not being aware, not involved.
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:18.720]   "It's absolutely not true.
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:19.760]   "They could have risen up.
[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:21.440]   "They could have fought against that evil regime,
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:23.600]   "which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat,
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:24.680]   "but we are at war.
[03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:26.200]   "We are defending our homes.
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:27.640]   "We are protecting our homes.
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:30.160]   "That's the truth, and when a nation protects its home,
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:31.280]   "it fights, and we will fight
[03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:32.840]   "until we break their backbone."
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:34.160]   He acknowledged that many Gazans
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:35.600]   had nothing to do with Hamas,
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:37.160]   but was adamant that others did.
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:39.840]   Quote, "I agree there are many innocent Palestinians
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.120]   "who don't agree with this,
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:43.160]   "but you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen,
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:44.480]   "and you wanna shoot it at me.
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:45.880]   "Am I allowed to defend myself?
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:47.360]   "We have to defend ourselves.
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:48.920]   "We have the right to do so."
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:51.920]   This is not the same as saying there's no distinction
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:53.880]   between militants and civilians in Gaza.
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:55.960]   His statement here is actually fully compliant
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:13:58.000]   with international law, to the letter,
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.600]   because if you are storing military supplies
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:03.320]   in civilian areas, these things become military targets,
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:04.160]   and you're allowed to do
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:05.800]   proportionality assessments afterwards.
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:08.040]   So this is supposed to be one of many quotes
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:10.400]   that they've shown that is supposed to demonstrate
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:13.520]   genocidal intent, but it is very easily explained
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:16.200]   by military intent, or by a conflict between two parties.
[03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:17.840]   - I saw that press conference.
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:19.160]   - Wait, let me just say something.
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:21.200]   All of this talk is a bit irrelevant,
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:24.120]   because it may sound to the listeners
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:27.480]   that the court in The Hague has ruled
[03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:28.760]   that Israel is committing genocide.
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:30.240]   - No, I think we-- - It hasn't, it hasn't.
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:32.760]   It's just going in the next few years
[03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:34.200]   to look at the whole subject.
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:37.040]   There has been no determination at all.
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:40.640]   And as Stephen says, some of the quotes
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:42.600]   are not exactly accurate quotes,
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:45.200]   or taken out of context. - Total discharacterization.
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:50.200]   - Okay, it is correct, as Muin put it,
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:52.880]   that it'll be several years
[03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:56.000]   before the court makes a determination.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:57.840]   - And my guess is that it will determine
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:14:58.680]   there was no genocide.
[03:14:58.680 --> 03:14:59.520]   - I don't know. - We can only--
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:00.360]   - That's my guess. - I can't--
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:02.120]   - Yes, no, I'm just giving you my guess.
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:03.920]   - I can't predict.
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:06.880]   I got it all wrong, actually, as Muin will attest.
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:08.520]   I got it all wrong the first time.
[03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:09.880]   I never thought the American judge
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:12.600]   would vote in favor of plausibility.
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:14.080]   - So you admit that you were wrong?
[03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:15.200]   - Yeah, of course.
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:17.280]   I think I tell Muin twice a day,
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:20.160]   I was wrong about this, and I was wrong about that.
[03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:21.680]   I'm not wrong about the facts.
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:25.680]   I try not to be, but my speculations, they can be wrong.
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:27.800]   Okay, leaving that aside.
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:30.120]   First of all, as Muin pointed out,
[03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:32.840]   there's a difference between the legal decision
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:36.360]   by the ruling and an independent judgment.
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:41.040]   Now, South Africa was not filing a frivolous case.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.480]   That was 84 pages.
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:44.320]   It was single--
[03:15:44.320 --> 03:15:46.680]   - Even 84 pages can be pretty frivolous.
[03:15:46.680 --> 03:15:48.440]   - It takes an hour and a half to read.
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:50.240]   - It was not a massive case.
[03:15:50.240 --> 03:15:52.080]   - It was single-spaced,
[03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:54.320]   and it had literally hundreds of footnotes.
[03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:55.480]   - It can still be frivolous.
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:57.320]   - With, it's possible.
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:15:59.720]   - Of course, but this one wasn't.
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:01.280]   - Yeah, I read the report.
[03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:03.440]   To tell you the truth, I followed very closely
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:05.680]   everything that's been happening to October 7th.
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:07.200]   I was mesmerized.
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:09.480]   I couldn't believe the comprehensiveness
[03:16:09.480 --> 03:16:11.600]   of that particular report.
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:14.960]   Number two, there are two quite respected judges,
[03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:18.600]   excuse me, there were two quite respected experts
[03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:22.240]   of international law sitting on the South African panel,
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:24.960]   John Dugard and Vaughan Lowe.
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:26.560]   Vaughan Lowe, as you might know,
[03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:30.200]   he argued the war case in 2004
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:32.600]   before the International Court of Justice.
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:37.200]   Now, they were not, they were alleging genocide,
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:40.640]   which in their view means the evidence in their minds,
[03:16:40.640 --> 03:16:42.040]   we're not yet at the court,
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:45.920]   the evidence in their minds compels the conclusion
[03:16:45.920 --> 03:16:48.520]   that genocide is being committed.
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:52.600]   I am willing, because I happen to know Mr. Dugard personally
[03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.640]   and have corresponded with Vaughan Lowe,
[03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:57.440]   I've heard their claim, I've read the report,
[03:16:57.440 --> 03:17:00.840]   I would say they make a very strong case,
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.440]   but let's agree, plausible.
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:06.400]   Now, here's a question.
[03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:13.600]   If somebody qualifies for an Olympic team,
[03:17:13.600 --> 03:17:19.040]   let's say a regional person qualifies for an Olympic team,
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:22.480]   it doesn't mean they're going to be on the Olympic team,
[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:24.920]   it doesn't mean they're going to win a gold medal,
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:27.600]   a silver medal, or a bronze medal.
[03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:29.000]   - But they can swim, that's what you're saying.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.720]   - No, I would say that's a very high bar.
[03:17:31.720 --> 03:17:32.560]   - You're saying they can swim.
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:33.400]   - To even qualify.
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:36.320]   - They can swim well enough to have a realistic prospect
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:37.160]   of winning a medal.
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:41.640]   - So, to even make it to plausible.
[03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:42.480]   - That is not true.
[03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:44.680]   That is not what plausible means.
[03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:46.880]   It is absolutely not, you're dead wrong.
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:49.920]   - Mr. Borelli, please don't teach me
[03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:51.680]   about the English language.
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:54.160]   - So, the declaration of Judge Poincare
[03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:58.440]   says that the court is not asked in the present phase.
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:00.600]   The court is not asked at this present phase
[03:18:00.600 --> 03:18:02.800]   of the proceedings to determine whether South Africa's
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:05.400]   allegations of genocide are well-founded.
[03:18:05.400 --> 03:18:06.800]   They're not well-founded.
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:08.360]   They're not even well-founded.
[03:18:08.360 --> 03:18:10.600]   The court is, you said that plausible was a high standard.
[03:18:10.600 --> 03:18:12.800]   It is absolutely not.
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:14.960]   It is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:16.520]   against Israel, just like the majority
[03:18:16.520 --> 03:18:18.240]   of the quotes they have in this case are.
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:20.080]   And also, you said it was an extremely well-founded case.
[03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:22.720]   They spend like one fourth of all of the quotations,
[03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:24.720]   some even pulled from the Goldstone Report,
[03:18:24.720 --> 03:18:28.280]   that actually deal with the intent part.
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:29.840]   Which is, by the way, I think you guys,
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:31.680]   I don't know if you use the phrase, the dolo specialis,
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:33.360]   that the intentional part of genocide.
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:35.240]   - I don't know that term.
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:37.000]   - I think it's called dolo specialis.
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:38.840]   It's the most important part of genocide,
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:39.920]   which is proving the special,
[03:18:39.920 --> 03:18:42.200]   it is a highly special intent to commit genocide.
[03:18:42.200 --> 03:18:43.200]   It's possible that Israel could--
[03:18:43.200 --> 03:18:44.560]   - That's mens reum.
[03:18:44.560 --> 03:18:45.720]   - No.
[03:18:45.720 --> 03:18:48.440]   The mens reum, yes, I understand the state of mind,
[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:51.280]   but for genocide, there is, it's called dolo specialis,
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:52.920]   it's a highly special intent.
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:54.480]   Did you read the case?
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:57.640]   It is a highly special intent to be convicted of genocide.
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:18:58.480]   Yes.
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:01.440]   - Please stop displaying your imbecility.
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:03.360]   - Okay, I'm sorry if you think the declaration
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:04.200]   of the judge is imbecile.
[03:19:04.200 --> 03:19:07.560]   - Don't put on public display that you're a moron.
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:10.960]   At least have the self-possession to shut up.
[03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:11.800]   Did I read the case?
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:13.800]   - I'm comfortable putting my display on camera,
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:16.160]   you're comfortable putting yours in books, okay?
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:18.880]   - I read the case around four times.
[03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:23.880]   I read all of the majority opinion, the declarations.
[03:19:23.880 --> 03:19:26.680]   I read Aaron Barak's declaration.
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:27.520]   - Then why are you lying
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:29.960]   and saying plausibles are by standard?
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:34.960]   - Because I said even reaching the benchmark
[03:19:34.960 --> 03:19:41.400]   of plausibility is a very high standard in the world.
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:45.320]   It's the equivalent of a regional player
[03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:47.520]   qualifying for an Olympics.
[03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:49.800]   It's still two steps removed.
[03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:54.000]   You may not be on the team and you may not get a medal,
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:57.960]   but to get qualified, which in this context
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:20:00.680]   is the equivalent of plausible,
[03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:05.120]   you must be doing something pretty horrible.
[03:20:05.120 --> 03:20:06.280]   And as it happens--
[03:20:06.280 --> 03:20:08.760]   - The court will rule on this.
[03:20:08.760 --> 03:20:09.600]   There was no genital.
[03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:11.280]   That's what the court will rule.
[03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:12.920]   Remember what I just told you.
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:13.760]   The court will rule--
[03:20:13.760 --> 03:20:15.000]   - I don't expect to be even around
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000]   when the court reaches its final decision.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:17.840]   - Why?
[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:18.680]   - Why?
[03:20:18.680 --> 03:20:19.960]   It'll take a long, long time.
[03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:20.800]   - Two years, three years.
[03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:22.920]   - No, I don't think it'll take two or three years.
[03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:26.160]   - Bosnia, which was admittedly a special type of case
[03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:29.680]   because they were accusing Serbia
[03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:31.560]   of sponsoring the Bosnian Serbs.
[03:20:31.560 --> 03:20:35.480]   That took, I think, 17 years from 90--
[03:20:35.480 --> 03:20:36.960]   - I assume they'll take two or three years.
[03:20:36.960 --> 03:20:38.800]   - But the point you're making,
[03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:39.640]   so this is a legal--
[03:20:39.640 --> 03:20:42.480]   - I'm saying that something horrible must be happening
[03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:43.320]   to even achieve--
[03:20:43.320 --> 03:20:44.160]   - It is horrible.
[03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:45.000]   It's a war.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:45.840]   - Yeah.
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:46.680]   - It's true, yes.
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:47.520]   - It's horrible.
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:50.720]   - They weren't rendering a ruling on the war.
[03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:52.880]   They were rendering a ruling on the genocide.
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:54.840]   - And I think the suggestion--
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:55.680]   - They said it was plausible.
[03:20:55.680 --> 03:20:56.720]   They also said it was plausible
[03:20:56.720 --> 03:20:59.000]   that Israel is committing a military operation as well.
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.560]   - Yeah, but I think the problem with your characterization
[03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:03.320]   is you're saying in so many words
[03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:06.080]   that South Africans basically only have to show up in court
[03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:07.280]   with a coherent statement.
[03:21:07.280 --> 03:21:08.120]   - Right, that is correct.
[03:21:08.120 --> 03:21:10.520]   - In today's atmosphere, that's probably correct.
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:12.040]   - They needed to do a lot more.
[03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:12.880]   - Not much more.
[03:21:12.880 --> 03:21:13.720]   - They needed to persuade--
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:14.560]   - The American judge?
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:15.400]   - In today's atmosphere--
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:16.240]   - The American judge?
[03:21:16.240 --> 03:21:17.080]   - The American judge?
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:17.920]   - They needed to persuade--
[03:21:17.920 --> 03:21:20.480]   - Judges go according to what the majority want to hear.
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:21.320]   - Yeah, but they needed--
[03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:22.400]   - That's why he's the president.
[03:21:22.400 --> 03:21:25.080]   - They needed to persuade the court
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:28.760]   that it was worth investing several years of their time
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:29.600]   in hearing this case.
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:31.120]   - They're probably well paid for it.
[03:21:31.120 --> 03:21:33.880]   - They're well paid whether they take this case or not.
[03:21:33.880 --> 03:21:37.400]   I mean, they have a full docket
[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:39.120]   whether they accept or reject this case.
[03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:41.600]   And I think, I don't think we should--
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:42.600]   - Remember what I just said,
[03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:44.320]   they won't rule there was genocide.
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:45.200]   Remember what I said.
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:47.080]   - Also, I recommend people actually read the case
[03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:48.400]   and follow through a lot of the quotes,
[03:21:48.400 --> 03:21:50.280]   that they just don't show genocidal intent.
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:51.780]   - Mr. Perelli, brace yourself.
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:53.200]   - The Israeli minister of finance
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:54.880]   on the 8th of October, 2023.
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:56.600]   This is taken from the ICJ.
[03:21:56.600 --> 03:21:58.480]   This is from South Africa submission.
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:22:00.240]   Bezalel Smotrik, I can't read this.
[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:01.080]   Stated--
[03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:01.900]   - Bezalel Smotrik.
[03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:02.740]   - There you go.
[03:22:02.740 --> 03:22:03.580]   Okay, at a meeting of the Israeli cabinet that quote,
[03:22:03.580 --> 03:22:06.440]   "We need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:08.280]   and take down Gaza," end quote.
[03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:10.240]   But again, if you click through and you read the source,
[03:22:10.240 --> 03:22:13.120]   their own linked source, it says as per this own source,
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:14.920]   quote, "The powerful finance minister,
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:16.840]   settler leader Bezalel Smotrik,"
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:17.680]   I can't pronounce his name,
[03:22:17.680 --> 03:22:19.160]   "Demanded at the cabinet meeting late Saturday
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:21.740]   that the army," quote, "Hit Hamas brutally
[03:22:21.740 --> 03:22:23.660]   and not take the matter of the captives
[03:22:23.660 --> 03:22:25.540]   into significant consideration," end quote.
[03:22:25.540 --> 03:22:28.460]   Quote, "In war, as in war, you have to be brutal," end quote.
[03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:30.460]   He was quoted as saying, quote, "We need to deal a blow
[03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:31.780]   that hasn't been seen in 50 years
[03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:33.420]   and take down Gaza," end quote.
[03:22:33.420 --> 03:22:36.220]   You can't strip the quotation of Hamas,
[03:22:36.220 --> 03:22:37.540]   a entity that you have one with,
[03:22:37.540 --> 03:22:38.380]   and then--
[03:22:38.380 --> 03:22:39.220]   - I think--
[03:22:39.220 --> 03:22:40.040]   - There's genocidal intent.
[03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:40.880]   - I think take down Gaza.
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:41.720]   - That's not genocidal intent.
[03:22:41.720 --> 03:22:42.540]   - Take down Gaza.
[03:22:42.540 --> 03:22:43.380]   - So when the Ukrainians say--
[03:22:43.380 --> 03:22:44.220]   - Take down Gaza.
[03:22:44.220 --> 03:22:45.040]   - When the Ukrainians say we need to defeat Russia.
[03:22:45.040 --> 03:22:45.880]   - Take down Gaza.
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:46.720]   - That's not genocidal.
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:47.540]   - No.
[03:22:47.540 --> 03:22:48.620]   - When the Ukrainians say we need to defeat Russia,
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:49.460]   is that genocidal?
[03:22:49.460 --> 03:22:51.480]   Do they mean killing all Russian citizens?
[03:22:51.480 --> 03:22:53.400]   - Professor Morris, here's another one.
[03:22:53.400 --> 03:22:54.240]   - It's ridiculous.
[03:22:54.240 --> 03:22:55.780]   - When the defense, yeah, ridiculous.
[03:22:55.780 --> 03:22:56.620]   - Yes, ridiculous.
[03:22:56.620 --> 03:22:58.480]   - The American judge--
[03:22:58.480 --> 03:23:00.320]   - He also doesn't determine policy, but that's--
[03:23:00.320 --> 03:23:04.120]   - The American judge, the American judge read--
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:06.360]   - You are holding the American judge to, you know--
[03:23:06.360 --> 03:23:07.200]   - Well, he was the president.
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:08.440]   - Yes, he'll appeal his own authority
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:09.760]   when it agrees with him, and we won't deal
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:11.920]   with the actual facts of the matter, ever.
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:15.680]   - The American judge read several of the quotes.
[03:23:15.680 --> 03:23:16.520]   - Look at the American--
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:17.340]   - Okay.
[03:23:17.340 --> 03:23:18.180]   - They may support today.
[03:23:18.180 --> 03:23:19.000]   They may support Trump.
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:19.840]   - Okay, look.
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:20.680]   - It shows you how worthy American judges are.
[03:23:20.680 --> 03:23:22.600]   - Professor Morris, Professor Morris,
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:24.880]   without going too far afield,
[03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:30.760]   if you heard a statement by the defense minister,
[03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:35.000]   the defense minister said we are going to prevent
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:39.760]   any food, water, fuel, or electricity from entering Gaza.
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:40.600]   - Did he do that?
[03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:41.420]   He wanted to make--
[03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:42.260]   - Did Israel do that?
[03:23:42.260 --> 03:23:43.200]   - Okay, no, I'm wondering.
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:44.040]   - What he said--
[03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:44.880]   - I'm asking you--
[03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:45.720]   - Isn't Israeli government policy?
[03:23:45.720 --> 03:23:48.760]   - Yeah, but we're talking about statements now, intent.
[03:23:48.760 --> 03:23:50.120]   How would you interpret that?
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:52.520]   - After 1,200 of your citizens are murdered
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:55.520]   the way they were, I would expect extreme statements
[03:23:55.520 --> 03:23:57.020]   by lots of politicians.
[03:23:57.020 --> 03:23:57.860]   - But you're--
[03:23:57.860 --> 03:23:58.680]   - By lots of politicians.
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:23:59.520]   - But you don't accept extreme Palestinian--
[03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:01.020]   - But that's not Israeli policy.
[03:24:01.020 --> 03:24:01.860]   - Wait, but you don't accept--
[03:24:01.860 --> 03:24:03.320]   - What he said isn't Israeli policy.
[03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:04.160]   - But you don't believe--
[03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:05.320]   - They let in water, they let in gas.
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:06.160]   - I'm sure--
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:06.980]   - But you don't accept--
[03:24:06.980 --> 03:24:07.820]   - Very true, very true.
[03:24:07.820 --> 03:24:09.960]   - But you don't accept extreme Palestinian statements
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:11.960]   after they lost their entire country,
[03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:12.800]   not just 1,200 people.
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:14.560]   - That's a good point.
[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:15.400]   No, no, it's a good point.
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:20.400]   On that, on that moment, brief moment of agreement,
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:22.640]   let's just take a quick pause.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:24.800]   We need a smoke break, we need a water break,
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:25.640]   we need a bathroom break.
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:26.960]   - Take down Gaza is not a genocide.
[03:24:26.960 --> 03:24:27.800]   - I don't know what it means.
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:28.620]   - To defeat Russia is a genocidal statement.
[03:24:28.620 --> 03:24:29.460]   - What does take down Gaza mean?
[03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:30.440]   - When we went to war with Iraq
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:31.480]   and we wanted to destroy Iraq,
[03:24:31.480 --> 03:24:32.920]   that was a genocidal statement.
[03:24:32.920 --> 03:24:34.480]   There's a reason why genocide is so,
[03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:36.400]   is such an importantly guarded concept
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:38.640]   and it's not to condemn every nation that goes to war.
[03:24:38.640 --> 03:24:40.100]   - Mr. Panel.
[03:24:40.100 --> 03:24:41.680]   - Wait, you do know how to pronounce my name.
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:43.780]   Are you mispronouncing it intentionally?
[03:24:43.780 --> 03:24:45.440]   - I made you into an Italian all the time.
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:49.860]   - I'm so touched by your solicitude for international law.
[03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:50.960]   - You should try learning it sometime.
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:52.960]   It would help you sort out a lot of the civilian deaths.
[03:24:52.960 --> 03:24:55.480]   - Unfortunately, 15 judges disagreed.
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:56.960]   - You could keep citing the judges.
[03:24:56.960 --> 03:24:59.680]   You should actually try reading the actual statements.
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:00.680]   - This is tiring.
[03:25:00.680 --> 03:25:03.720]   You've invited us to a tiring session.
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:05.600]   - Yeah, there you go.
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:06.840]   How are you guys doing?
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:08.000]   - Okay, okay.
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:11.040]   There are major things to discuss here,
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:13.040]   not just what some court is doing
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:14.820]   that I'm gonna judge in two years' time.
[03:25:14.820 --> 03:25:15.660]   - Yes, okay.
[03:25:15.660 --> 03:25:17.900]   So what you just said is my whole,
[03:25:17.900 --> 03:25:19.740]   one of the reasons why I feel so strongly
[03:25:19.740 --> 03:25:21.220]   about this particular conflict
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:22.980]   is because there are really important things to discuss,
[03:25:22.980 --> 03:25:24.220]   but they will never be discussed.
[03:25:24.220 --> 03:25:25.060]   - They're not really discussed.
[03:25:25.060 --> 03:25:28.160]   - We're not gonna talk about like Area A, B, and C
[03:25:28.160 --> 03:25:29.420]   or what a transference of territory,
[03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:30.760]   instead we're gonna talk about apartheid.
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:32.960]   We're not gonna talk about the differences
[03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:34.940]   in how do you conduct war in an urban environment
[03:25:34.940 --> 03:25:36.580]   where people use, we're just gonna talk about genocide.
[03:25:36.580 --> 03:25:39.020]   We're not gonna talk about what's a good solution
[03:25:39.020 --> 03:25:39.860]   for the Palestinians.
[03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:40.700]   We're just gonna say ethnic cleansing.
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:42.480]   - Is it possible to talk, be productive
[03:25:42.480 --> 03:25:44.520]   over the next two hours and talk about a solution?
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:47.400]   - About solutions, I have no idea what to say.
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:50.060]   I mean, I don't see any solutions.
[03:25:50.060 --> 03:25:52.600]   You know, if you wanted a positive end to this discussion,
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:54.220]   which is what you said at the beginning,
[03:25:54.220 --> 03:25:57.080]   I can't contribute to that 'cause I'm pessimistic.
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:25:59.200]   I don't see any way forward here.
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:01.560]   - But the lack of, the solution is easy.
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:02.840]   The reason why the solution is hard
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:05.320]   is because the histories and the myths are completely,
[03:26:05.320 --> 03:26:07.440]   there's a different factual record, right?
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:09.960]   - One of the things it'd be good to talk about solutions
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:13.660]   with the future is going back in all the times it has failed.
[03:26:13.660 --> 03:26:14.500]   So every time--
[03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:15.740]   - But even at that, we're probably not gonna agree.
[03:26:15.740 --> 03:26:16.820]   He's gonna say, you could write that,
[03:26:16.820 --> 03:26:17.780]   I can predict the whole line.
[03:26:17.780 --> 03:26:19.540]   He's gonna say from '93 to '99, he's gonna say
[03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:21.780]   Israel didn't adhere to the Oslo Accords ever.
[03:26:21.780 --> 03:26:23.620]   Settlement expansion continued,
[03:26:23.620 --> 03:26:25.860]   raids happened into the West Bank,
[03:26:25.860 --> 03:26:27.220]   that there was never a legitimate,
[03:26:27.220 --> 03:26:31.540]   that Netanyahu came in and violated the Y memorandum,
[03:26:31.540 --> 03:26:33.180]   the transparency, he's gonna say all of this,
[03:26:33.180 --> 03:26:34.500]   and he's not gonna bring up any of the Palestinian side.
[03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:36.620]   And then for Camp David, he's gonna say that,
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:37.980]   yeah, that Arafat was trying,
[03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:39.420]   that the maps and the territorial exchange
[03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:41.620]   wasn't good enough, that they were asking Palestinians
[03:26:41.620 --> 03:26:44.560]   to make all the concessions, that Israel would've, yeah.
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:46.500]   - Well, lay it all out, lay it out.
[03:26:46.500 --> 03:26:47.680]   - You do fall quickly, you know?
[03:26:47.680 --> 03:26:48.780]   - Yeah, I know, yeah.
[03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:54.420]   - Anyhow, my future book should interest you guys.
[03:26:54.420 --> 03:26:55.860]   - Oh, what are you working on?
[03:26:55.860 --> 03:26:58.980]   - No, not working on, it's actually going to come out.
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:00.260]   - Oh.
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:03.940]   - It deals with Israeli and Arab atrocities,
[03:27:03.940 --> 03:27:06.660]   war crimes, I call them, in the '48 war.
[03:27:06.660 --> 03:27:08.020]   - Oh, really? - That's my new book, yeah.
[03:27:08.020 --> 03:27:09.340]   Just deals with that subject.
[03:27:09.340 --> 03:27:14.020]   - Is this, 'cause I know you've also talked
[03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:16.500]   about the closure of the archives and stuff.
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:20.640]   - Well, it's marginal, it deals with that as well,
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:23.060]   but they have tried to seal off documents
[03:27:23.060 --> 03:27:25.380]   which had already used and seen.
[03:27:25.380 --> 03:27:28.300]   So now they don't let people see them, that's happened.
[03:27:28.300 --> 03:27:32.020]   But it's marginal in terms of its effect on--
[03:27:32.020 --> 03:27:34.180]   - Were the British archives useful for you,
[03:27:34.180 --> 03:27:35.260]   for this new book?
[03:27:35.260 --> 03:27:38.540]   - Well, for this list, it's mostly Israeli archives.
[03:27:38.540 --> 03:27:40.340]   The British and the Americans and the UN
[03:27:40.340 --> 03:27:42.100]   did deal with these subjects,
[03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:44.780]   but not as well as Israeli documents.
[03:27:44.780 --> 03:27:48.620]   - What's your casualty count for Deir Yassin?
[03:27:48.620 --> 03:27:50.620]   - It's about 100, I think there's agreement on that
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:53.580]   by Israelis and Arabs, 100, 105.
[03:27:53.580 --> 03:27:54.900]   - 'Cause before they were--
[03:27:54.900 --> 03:27:58.340]   - They used to say 245 or 254, those were the figures
[03:27:58.340 --> 03:28:00.540]   the British and the Arabs and the Haganah
[03:28:00.540 --> 03:28:02.140]   agreed on at the beginning.
[03:28:02.140 --> 03:28:03.620]   - Because the Red Cross, I think,
[03:28:03.620 --> 03:28:05.540]   was the one that first put out that number.
[03:28:05.540 --> 03:28:07.900]   - I don't remember, maybe it was, what's his name,
[03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:10.060]   Jacques Derainier, or maybe.
[03:28:10.060 --> 03:28:13.500]   Yeah, maybe he came up with that number.
[03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.380]   But it was just, they didn't count, they didn't count bodies.
[03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:17.660]   They just threw the number out,
[03:28:17.660 --> 03:28:21.340]   and everybody was happy to blame the Irgun and the Lehi
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:23.180]   for killing more Arabs than actually--
[03:28:23.180 --> 03:28:25.980]   - Well, and they put it to good use as well.
[03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:28.020]   - Well, they said that it helped
[03:28:28.020 --> 03:28:30.460]   precipitate more evacuations, so they were happy--
[03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:31.300]   - I think Begin and his memoirs--
[03:28:31.300 --> 03:28:34.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they also used that number, yeah.
[03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:37.180]   - So first of all, thank you for that heated discussion
[03:28:37.180 --> 03:28:38.240]   about the present.
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:44.020]   I would love to go back into history
[03:28:44.020 --> 03:28:46.860]   in a way that informs what we can look for
[03:28:46.860 --> 03:28:51.300]   by way of hope for the future.
[03:28:51.300 --> 03:28:53.780]   So when has, in Israel and Palestine,
[03:28:53.780 --> 03:28:58.340]   have we been closest to something like a peace settlement?
[03:28:58.340 --> 03:29:03.020]   To something that, like where both sides would be happy
[03:29:03.020 --> 03:29:05.740]   and enable the flourishing of both peoples?
[03:29:05.740 --> 03:29:11.920]   - Well, from my knowledge of the 120 years or so of conflict,
[03:29:11.920 --> 03:29:15.340]   the closest I think the two sides have been
[03:29:15.340 --> 03:29:17.620]   to reaching some sort of settlement
[03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:20.820]   appears to have been in the year 2000,
[03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:25.220]   when Barack, and then subsequently Clinton,
[03:29:25.220 --> 03:29:28.420]   offered a two-state settlement
[03:29:28.420 --> 03:29:34.420]   to PLO, Palestinian Authority, chairman Yasser Arafat.
[03:29:34.420 --> 03:29:36.940]   And Arafat seemed to waver.
[03:29:36.940 --> 03:29:41.940]   He didn't immediately reject what was being offered,
[03:29:41.940 --> 03:29:44.460]   but ultimately came down at the end of Camp David
[03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:48.140]   in July 2000, he came down against the proposals,
[03:29:48.140 --> 03:29:50.820]   and Clinton, who said he wouldn't blame him later,
[03:29:50.820 --> 03:29:54.420]   blamed Arafat for bringing down the summit.
[03:29:54.420 --> 03:29:57.540]   And not reaching a solution there.
[03:29:57.540 --> 03:30:01.940]   But I think there on the table,
[03:30:01.940 --> 03:30:04.780]   certainly in the Clinton parameters of December 2000,
[03:30:04.780 --> 03:30:09.780]   which followed the proposals by Barack in July,
[03:30:09.780 --> 03:30:13.600]   the Palestinians were offered the best deal
[03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:15.260]   they're ever going to get from Israel,
[03:30:15.260 --> 03:30:16.600]   unless Israel is destroyed,
[03:30:16.600 --> 03:30:19.380]   and then there'll just be a Palestinian Arab state.
[03:30:19.380 --> 03:30:22.140]   But the best deal that Israel could ever offer them,
[03:30:22.140 --> 03:30:25.420]   they were offered, which essentially was 95%
[03:30:25.420 --> 03:30:28.320]   of the West Bank, East Jerusalem,
[03:30:28.320 --> 03:30:30.220]   half of the old city of Jerusalem,
[03:30:30.220 --> 03:30:33.620]   some sort of joint control of the Temple Mount,
[03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:36.100]   and the Gaza Strip, of course, in full,
[03:30:36.100 --> 03:30:38.620]   and the Palestinians said no to this deal.
[03:30:38.620 --> 03:30:41.020]   And nobody really knows why Arafat said no,
[03:30:41.020 --> 03:30:44.320]   that is, some people think he was trying to hold out
[03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:46.400]   for slightly better terms.
[03:30:47.300 --> 03:30:52.300]   But my reading is that he was constitutionally,
[03:30:52.300 --> 03:30:55.060]   psychologically incapable of signing off
[03:30:55.060 --> 03:30:57.380]   on a two-state deal, meaning acceptance
[03:30:57.380 --> 03:30:59.740]   of the existence of a Jewish state.
[03:30:59.740 --> 03:31:01.460]   This was really the problem.
[03:31:01.460 --> 03:31:02.900]   - Of Israel or of a Jewish state?
[03:31:02.900 --> 03:31:04.900]   - Of a Jewish state, the Jewish state of Israel.
[03:31:04.900 --> 03:31:07.700]   He wasn't willing to share Palestine with the Jews
[03:31:07.700 --> 03:31:11.460]   and put his name to that, I think he just couldn't do it.
[03:31:11.460 --> 03:31:12.620]   That's my reading.
[03:31:12.620 --> 03:31:14.900]   But some people say it was because the terms
[03:31:14.900 --> 03:31:16.780]   were insufficient and he was willing,
[03:31:16.780 --> 03:31:19.260]   but was waiting for slightly better terms.
[03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:21.620]   I don't buy that, I don't think so.
[03:31:21.620 --> 03:31:24.080]   But other people disagree with me on this.
[03:31:24.080 --> 03:31:25.580]   - What do you think?
[03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:28.620]   - Well, just briefly, in response,
[03:31:28.620 --> 03:31:35.500]   Arafat formally recognized Israel in 1993.
[03:31:35.500 --> 03:31:41.260]   I don't think, actually, that in 2000, 2001,
[03:31:41.260 --> 03:31:45.500]   a genuine resolution was on offer,
[03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:50.300]   because I think the maximum Israel was prepared to offer,
[03:31:50.300 --> 03:31:52.140]   admittedly more than it had been prepared
[03:31:52.140 --> 03:31:55.700]   to offer in the past, fell short of the minimum
[03:31:55.700 --> 03:31:57.620]   that the Palestinians considered
[03:31:57.620 --> 03:32:00.380]   to be a reasonable two-state settlement,
[03:32:00.380 --> 03:32:04.860]   bearing in mind that as of 1949,
[03:32:04.860 --> 03:32:09.440]   Israel controlled 78% of the British mandate of Palestine.
[03:32:10.540 --> 03:32:15.500]   The Palestinians were seeking a stay on the remaining 22%,
[03:32:15.500 --> 03:32:18.420]   and this was apparently too much for Israel.
[03:32:18.420 --> 03:32:20.660]   My response to your question would be--
[03:32:20.660 --> 03:32:21.900]   - Wait, wait, they were being offered
[03:32:21.900 --> 03:32:23.940]   something like 22 or 21%.
[03:32:23.940 --> 03:32:26.540]   - They were being offered, I think,
[03:32:26.540 --> 03:32:30.420]   less than a withdrawal to the 1967 borders
[03:32:30.420 --> 03:32:34.620]   with mutual and minor and reciprocal land swaps
[03:32:34.620 --> 03:32:37.060]   and the just resolution of--
[03:32:37.060 --> 03:32:39.140]   - The refugee problem was one of the problems.
[03:32:39.140 --> 03:32:43.620]   - Yes, you know, I worked for a number of years
[03:32:43.620 --> 03:32:46.500]   with International Crisis Group,
[03:32:46.500 --> 03:32:48.740]   and my boss at the time was Rob Malley,
[03:32:48.740 --> 03:32:50.820]   who was one of the American officials
[03:32:50.820 --> 03:32:53.300]   present at Camp David. - Was recently thrown out
[03:32:53.300 --> 03:32:55.380]   of the State Department or whatever.
[03:32:55.380 --> 03:32:59.460]   - The point I wanna make about Rob was,
[03:32:59.460 --> 03:33:03.380]   he wrote, I think, a very perceptive article in 2001
[03:33:03.380 --> 03:33:04.380]   in the New York Review of Books.
[03:33:04.380 --> 03:33:07.700]   I know that you and Ehud Barak have had a debate with him,
[03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:11.140]   but I think he gives a very compelling reason
[03:33:11.140 --> 03:33:15.860]   of why and how Camp David failed,
[03:33:15.860 --> 03:33:17.700]   but rather than going into that, I'll--
[03:33:17.700 --> 03:33:20.260]   - He wrote that together with Hussein Ara.
[03:33:20.260 --> 03:33:23.020]   - Hussein Ara, yes, who was not at Camp David.
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:24.060]   - Yes.
[03:33:24.060 --> 03:33:26.140]   - But in response to your question,
[03:33:26.140 --> 03:33:32.420]   I think there could have been a real possibility
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:37.820]   of Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli peace
[03:33:37.820 --> 03:33:42.820]   in the mid-1970s in the wake of the 1973 October War.
[03:33:42.820 --> 03:33:50.580]   I'll recall that in 1971, Moshe Dayan,
[03:33:50.580 --> 03:33:54.700]   Israel's defense minister at the time,
[03:33:54.700 --> 03:33:59.700]   full of triumphalism about Israel's victory in 1967,
[03:34:00.140 --> 03:34:03.300]   speaking to a group of Israeli military veterans,
[03:34:03.300 --> 03:34:08.300]   stated, "If I had to choose between Sharm el-Sheikh
[03:34:08.300 --> 03:34:12.860]   "without peace or peace without Sharm el-Sheikh,"
[03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:17.020]   this is referring to the resort in Egyptian Sinai,
[03:34:17.020 --> 03:34:19.100]   which was then under Israeli occupation,
[03:34:19.100 --> 03:34:22.640]   Dayan said, "I will choose for Sharm el-Sheikh
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:23.900]   "without peace."
[03:34:23.900 --> 03:34:27.980]   Then the 1973 war came along,
[03:34:27.980 --> 03:34:31.980]   and I think Israeli calculations
[03:34:31.980 --> 03:34:34.580]   began to change very significantly,
[03:34:34.580 --> 03:34:37.040]   and I think it was in that context
[03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:42.040]   that had there been a joint U.S.-Soviet push
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:50.700]   for an Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Palestinian resolution
[03:34:53.660 --> 03:34:56.900]   that incorporated both an Israeli withdrawal
[03:34:56.900 --> 03:35:00.420]   to the 1967 lines and the establishment
[03:35:00.420 --> 03:35:05.420]   of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories.
[03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:09.940]   I think there was a very reasonable prospect
[03:35:09.940 --> 03:35:11.760]   for that being achieved.
[03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:16.380]   It ended up being aborted, I think, for several reasons,
[03:35:16.380 --> 03:35:21.380]   and ultimately, the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat,
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:26.720]   decided, for reasons we can discuss later,
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:31.060]   to launch a separate unilateral initiative
[03:35:31.060 --> 03:35:35.660]   for Israeli-Egyptian rather than Arab-Israeli peace,
[03:35:35.660 --> 03:35:38.480]   and I think once that set in motion,
[03:35:38.480 --> 03:35:44.300]   the prospects disappeared because Israel essentially
[03:35:44.300 --> 03:35:49.000]   saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.760]   and felt that this would give it a free hand
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:54.320]   in the occupied territories, also in Lebanon,
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:35:56.680]   to get rid of the PLO and so on.
[03:35:56.680 --> 03:36:01.680]   So you ask when were we closest,
[03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:04.800]   and I can't give you an answer of when we were closest.
[03:36:04.800 --> 03:36:09.800]   I can only tell you when I think we could have been close,
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:14.320]   and that was a lost opportunity.
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:16.600]   If we look at the situation today,
[03:36:16.600 --> 03:36:19.040]   there's been a lot of discussion
[03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:21.240]   about a two-state settlement.
[03:36:21.240 --> 03:36:24.000]   My own view, and I've written about this,
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.120]   I don't buy the arguments of the naysayers
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:32.800]   that we have passed the so-called point of no return
[03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:35.200]   with respect to a two-state settlement.
[03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:39.920]   Certainly, if you look at the Israeli position
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:42.120]   in the occupied territories,
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:44.360]   I would argue it's more tenuous
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:48.560]   than was the French position in Algeria in 1954,
[03:36:48.560 --> 03:36:52.280]   than was the British position in Ireland in 1916,
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:57.280]   than was the Ethiopian position in Eritrea in 1990.
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:37:00.480]   And so, as a matter of practicality,
[03:37:00.480 --> 03:37:02.520]   as a matter of principle,
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:07.520]   I do think the establishment of a Palestinian state
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:11.980]   in the occupied territories remains realistic.
[03:37:11.980 --> 03:37:14.840]   I think the question that we now need to ask ourselves,
[03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:20.800]   it's one I'm certainly asking myself since October 7th,
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:25.160]   and looking at Israel's genocidal campaign,
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:27.000]   but also looking at larger questions,
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:28.760]   is it desirable?
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:33.640]   Can you have peace with what increasingly
[03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:40.000]   appears to be an irrational, genocidal state
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:43.120]   that seeks to confront and resolve
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:45.000]   each and every political challenge
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:49.760]   with violence, and that reacts to its failure
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:54.540]   to achieve solutions to political challenges
[03:37:54.540 --> 03:37:57.620]   with violence by applying even more violence,
[03:37:57.620 --> 03:38:02.080]   that has an insatiable lust for Palestinian territory,
[03:38:02.080 --> 03:38:07.160]   that a genocidal apartheid state
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:10.480]   that seems increasingly incapable
[03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:13.320]   of even conceiving of peaceful coexistence
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:17.860]   with the other people on that land.
[03:38:17.860 --> 03:38:22.900]   So I'm very pessimistic that a solution is possible.
[03:38:22.900 --> 03:38:26.800]   I look at, I grew up in Western Europe
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:30.400]   in the long shadow of the Second World War.
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:33.840]   I think we can all agree that there could have been
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:38.760]   no peace in Europe had certain regimes
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:41.720]   on that continent not been removed from power.
[03:38:42.680 --> 03:38:47.040]   I look at Southeast Asia in the late 1970s,
[03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:50.120]   and I think we're all agreed that there could not
[03:38:50.120 --> 03:38:51.800]   have been peace in that region
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:55.560]   had the Khmer Rouge not been ousted.
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:38:58.660]   I look at Southern Africa during the 1990s,
[03:38:58.660 --> 03:39:01.360]   and I think we can all be agreed
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:03.400]   that had the white minority regimes
[03:39:03.400 --> 03:39:08.820]   that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa not been dismantled,
[03:39:08.820 --> 03:39:11.520]   there could not have been peace in that region.
[03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:14.440]   And although I think it's worth having a discussion,
[03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:19.400]   I do think it's now a legitimate question to ask,
[03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:24.400]   can there be peace without dismantling the Zionist regime?
[03:39:24.400 --> 03:39:30.280]   And I make a very clear distinction
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:32.540]   between the Israeli state and its institutions
[03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:35.800]   on the one hand, and the Israeli people,
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:40.800]   who I think regardless of our discussion about the history,
[03:39:41.080 --> 03:39:43.560]   I think you can now talk about an Israeli people
[03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:48.560]   and a people that have developed rights over time,
[03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:53.560]   and a formula for peaceful coexistence with them
[03:39:53.560 --> 03:39:58.640]   will need to be found, which is a separate matter
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:03.000]   from dismantling the Israeli state and its institutions.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:06.060]   And again, I haven't reached clear conclusions about this,
[03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:09.240]   except to say as a practical matter,
[03:40:09.240 --> 03:40:14.240]   I think a two-state settlement remains feasible,
[03:40:14.240 --> 03:40:17.800]   but I think there are very legitimate questions
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:19.640]   about its desirability,
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:25.080]   and about whether peace can be achieved in the Middle East
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:29.400]   with the persistence of an irrational,
[03:40:29.400 --> 03:40:33.160]   genocidal, apartheid regime,
[03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:36.120]   particularly because Israeli society
[03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:41.120]   is beginning to develop many extremely, extremely
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:49.880]   distasteful, supremacist, dehumanizing aspects
[03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:53.680]   that I think also stand in the way of coexistence
[03:40:53.680 --> 03:40:57.240]   that are being fed by this regime.
[03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:01.000]   - So if you look back into history,
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:02.840]   when were we closest to peace,
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:05.280]   and do you draw any hope from any of them?
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:08.080]   - Um, I feel like in 2000,
[03:41:08.080 --> 03:41:10.640]   I feel like the deal that was present,
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:12.480]   at least at the end of the Taba summit,
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:14.640]   I think in terms of what Israel,
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:16.240]   I think had the appetite to give,
[03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:17.640]   and what the Palestinians would have gotten
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:19.680]   would have definitely been the most agreeable
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:20.920]   between the two parties.
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:24.440]   I don't know if in '73,
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:26.680]   I'm not sure if the appetite would have ever been there
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:30.400]   for the Arab states to negotiate alongside the Palestinians.
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:32.440]   I know that in Jordan,
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:35.320]   there was no love for the Palestinians after 1970,
[03:41:35.320 --> 03:41:36.920]   after Black September.
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:39.480]   I know that Sadat had no love for the Palestinians
[03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:43.120]   due to their association with the Muslim Brotherhoods,
[03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:46.640]   attempted assassinations in Egypt.
[03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:47.640]   - Sorry, which?
[03:41:47.640 --> 03:41:49.480]   PLO and the Muslim Brotherhood?
[03:41:49.480 --> 03:41:52.240]   - Sadat was upset because there were attempted assassinations
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:54.800]   by people in, oh no, an assassination.
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:57.240]   It was a personal friend of his, Yusuf al-Sibai,
[03:41:57.240 --> 03:41:58.080]   I can't pronounce that.
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:00.080]   He was assassinated in Cyprus by a Palestinian squad.
[03:42:00.080 --> 03:42:01.720]   - He was killed by the Abu Nidal organization,
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:02.720]   which was not part of the PLO.
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:04.040]   - Admittedly, yeah, he says as much.
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:05.720]   Belongs to a center group, not the PLO directly,
[03:42:05.720 --> 03:42:08.040]   but I think that there was a history
[03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:11.320]   of the Palestinians sometimes fighting
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:13.360]   with their neighboring states that were hosting them
[03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:14.960]   if they weren't getting the political concessions
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:16.240]   they wanted.
[03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:18.080]   The assassination of the Jordanian king in '51
[03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:20.760]   might be another example of that in Jordan.
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:23.040]   It feels like over a long period of time,
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:25.920]   it feels like the Palestinians have been kind of told
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:27.440]   from the neighboring Arab states
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:30.720]   that if they just continue to enact violence,
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:32.480]   whether in Israel or abroad,
[03:42:32.480 --> 03:42:35.560]   that eventually a state will materialize somehow.
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:37.640]   I don't think it's gotten them any closer to a state.
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:39.440]   If anything, I think it's taken them farther and farther
[03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:41.040]   and farther away from one.
[03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:43.520]   And I think as long as the hyperbolic language
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:45.720]   is continually employed internationally,
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:47.720]   the idea that Israel is committing a genocide,
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:49.160]   the idea that there is an apartheid,
[03:42:49.160 --> 03:42:51.320]   the idea that they live in a concentration camp,
[03:42:51.320 --> 03:42:53.520]   all of these words, I think, further the narrative
[03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:55.600]   for the Palestinians that Israel is an evil state
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:57.440]   that needs to be dismantled.
[03:42:57.440 --> 03:42:59.360]   I mean, you said as much about the institution, at least,
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:00.760]   for the Zionist government.
[03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:02.640]   Israel's government is probably not going anywhere.
[03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:04.640]   All of the other surrounding Arab states have accepted that,
[03:43:04.640 --> 03:43:06.960]   or at least most of them down in the Gulf,
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:08.680]   Egypt and Jordan, have accepted that.
[03:43:08.680 --> 03:43:10.440]   The Palestinians need to accept it too.
[03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:12.960]   The Israeli state or the state apparatus
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:13.840]   is not going anywhere.
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:15.280]   And at some point, they need to realize like,
[03:43:15.280 --> 03:43:17.120]   hey, we need a leader that's gonna come out
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:19.160]   and represent us, represent all of us,
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:20.680]   is willing to take political risks,
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:23.720]   is willing to negotiate some lasting peace for us.
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:26.120]   And it's not gonna be the international community
[03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:28.800]   or some invocation of international law
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:30.800]   or some invocation of morality or justice
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:32.400]   that's going to extricate us from this conflict.
[03:43:32.400 --> 03:43:35.240]   It's gonna take some actual difficult political maneuvering
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:36.080]   on the ground.
[03:43:36.080 --> 03:43:37.480]   - Of accepting Israel.
[03:43:37.480 --> 03:43:38.320]   - Of accepting Israel, yeah.
[03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:41.120]   - Which they formally did in 1993.
[03:43:41.120 --> 03:43:42.880]   - Which they formally did in 1993, yeah,
[03:43:42.880 --> 03:43:46.920]   but then no lasting peace came after that in 2000.
[03:43:46.920 --> 03:43:50.520]   - No, because 1993 was not a peace agreement.
[03:43:50.520 --> 03:43:51.680]   - Sure, the Oslo Accords weren't--
[03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:52.520]   - Were an interim-- - Didn't have
[03:43:52.520 --> 03:43:53.340]   a final solution, of course.
[03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:55.320]   - Were an interim agreement.
[03:43:55.320 --> 03:43:59.840]   And Palestinians actually began clamoring
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:04.840]   for commencing the permanent status resolutions on schedule.
[03:44:04.840 --> 03:44:08.040]   And the Israelis kept delaying them.
[03:44:08.040 --> 03:44:12.480]   In fact, they only began, I believe in '99,
[03:44:12.480 --> 03:44:15.160]   under American pressure on the Israelis.
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:17.320]   - I think you're being a bit one-sided.
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:21.800]   Both sides didn't fulfill the promise of Oslo
[03:44:21.800 --> 03:44:23.720]   and the steps needed for Oslo.
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:25.520]   There was Palestinian terrorism,
[03:44:25.520 --> 03:44:28.120]   which accompanied Israel's expansion of settlements
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:29.040]   and other things.
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:33.440]   The two things fed each other and led to what happened
[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:36.720]   in 2000, which was a breakdown of the talks altogether
[03:44:36.720 --> 03:44:38.440]   when the Palestinians said no.
[03:44:38.440 --> 03:44:41.180]   But I think there's, I don't agree incidentally
[03:44:41.180 --> 03:44:44.560]   with this definition of Israel or the Israeli state
[03:44:44.560 --> 03:44:46.780]   as apartheid, it's not.
[03:44:46.780 --> 03:44:49.600]   There is some sort of apartheid going on in the West Bank.
[03:44:49.600 --> 03:44:52.400]   The Israeli regime itself is not an apartheid regime.
[03:44:52.400 --> 03:44:55.520]   That's just nonsense by any definition of apartheid,
[03:44:55.520 --> 03:44:57.160]   which-- - Well, by the formal definition,
[03:44:57.160 --> 03:44:58.520]   I think it qualifies.
[03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:00.160]   - No, it doesn't qualify.
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:03.560]   Apartheid is a race-based distinction
[03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:06.320]   between different segments of the population,
[03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:09.200]   and some of them don't have any representation at all,
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:10.960]   like the blacks in South Africa.
[03:45:10.960 --> 03:45:12.800]   No rights at all. - That's not a requirement.
[03:45:12.800 --> 03:45:17.100]   - In Israel itself, the minority, the Arabs,
[03:45:17.100 --> 03:45:20.200]   do have representation, do have rights, and so on.
[03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:21.960]   I don't think Israel is also genocidal.
[03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:23.200]   I don't think it's been genocidal.
[03:45:23.200 --> 03:45:26.320]   It wasn't so in '48, it wasn't so in '67,
[03:45:26.320 --> 03:45:28.520]   and it hasn't been recently, in my view.
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:31.440]   And talk about dismantling Israel,
[03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:33.760]   and that's what you're talking about,
[03:45:33.760 --> 03:45:38.400]   is, I think Stephen said it correctly, is counterproductive.
[03:45:38.400 --> 03:45:40.640]   It just pushes Israelis further away
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:44.200]   from willing to give Palestinians anything.
[03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:46.360]   - Please, Norm, tell me you have--
[03:45:46.360 --> 03:45:48.600]   - Something optimistic to say. - Optimistic to say.
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:52.720]   - I, even though I agree, I've thought about it a lot,
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:57.080]   and I agree with Muin's analysis.
[03:45:57.080 --> 03:46:00.640]   I'm not really in the business of punditry.
[03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:02.640]   I'd rather look at the historical record
[03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:06.680]   where I feel more comfortable, and I feel on terra firma.
[03:46:06.680 --> 03:46:09.300]   So I'd like to just go through that.
[03:46:09.300 --> 03:46:12.380]   I don't quite, I agree and I disagree
[03:46:12.380 --> 03:46:15.120]   with Muin on the '73 issue.
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:20.120]   After the 1973 war, it was clear that Israel
[03:46:20.120 --> 03:46:23.760]   was surprised by what happened during the war,
[03:46:23.760 --> 03:46:28.760]   and it took a big hit.
[03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:31.280]   The estimates are, I don't know what numbers you use,
[03:46:31.280 --> 03:46:34.720]   but I hear between 2,000 and 3,000 Israeli soldiers
[03:46:34.720 --> 03:46:36.680]   were killed during the 1970s.
[03:46:36.680 --> 03:46:38.160]   - It was 2,500.
[03:46:38.160 --> 03:46:39.240]   - Yeah, 2,700.
[03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:40.560]   - Okay, so I got it right.
[03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:41.920]   I read different numbers.
[03:46:41.920 --> 03:46:46.920]   That's a very large number of Israelis who were killed.
[03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:49.120]   There were moments at the beginning of the war
[03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:52.080]   where there was a fear that this might be it.
[03:46:52.080 --> 03:46:53.740]   - No, no, there wasn't, there wasn't, there wasn't.
[03:46:53.740 --> 03:46:55.440]   - No, the Israelis-- - This is nonsense.
[03:46:55.440 --> 03:46:57.920]   Everybody forgets Israel's atomic weaponry.
[03:46:57.920 --> 03:46:58.920]   - I know, but--
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:00.400]   - So how could they have been defeated?
[03:47:00.400 --> 03:47:03.280]   - Didn't Dayan talk about the collapse of the Third Temple?
[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:06.080]   - He did, but it was hysterical and silly
[03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:07.560]   because Israel had atomic weapons.
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:09.560]   They wanted to stop the Syrians or the Egyptians.
[03:47:09.560 --> 03:47:11.440]   - But we're talking about perceptions here.
[03:47:11.440 --> 03:47:12.640]   I'm not saying, I can't tell you
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:14.000]   if he was hysterical or not.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:14.840]   - No, he was.
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:15.660]   For a day, he was hysterical.
[03:47:15.660 --> 03:47:16.500]   - I wasn't in the same room with him.
[03:47:16.500 --> 03:47:17.340]   - For a day, he was hysterical.
[03:47:17.340 --> 03:47:20.240]   - But I'm just saying, let's not bog down on that.
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:25.240]   The war is over, and when President Carter comes into power,
[03:47:25.240 --> 03:47:27.360]   Carter was an extremely smart guy,
[03:47:27.360 --> 03:47:29.440]   Jimmy Carter, extremely smart guy,
[03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:32.120]   and he was very fixed on details, extreme.
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:33.480]   He was probably the most impressive
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:35.280]   of modern American presidents,
[03:47:35.280 --> 03:47:37.480]   in my opinion, by a wide margin.
[03:47:37.480 --> 03:47:40.080]   And he was determined to resolve the conflict
[03:47:41.080 --> 03:47:44.240]   on a big scale, on the Arab-Israeli scale.
[03:47:44.240 --> 03:47:48.300]   On the Palestinian issue, he wouldn't go past
[03:47:48.300 --> 03:47:50.520]   what he called a Palestinian homeland.
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:51.340]   He wouldn't accept--
[03:47:51.340 --> 03:47:52.180]   - Palestinian national home.
[03:47:52.180 --> 03:47:54.000]   - On the Palestinian national home,
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:56.840]   he wouldn't go as far as a Palestinian state.
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:47:59.880]   I'm not going to go into the details of that.
[03:47:59.880 --> 03:48:01.560]   I don't think realistically,
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:03.440]   given the political balance of forces,
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:06.980]   that was going to happen, but that's a separate issue.
[03:48:06.980 --> 03:48:08.600]   Let's get to the issue at hand,
[03:48:08.600 --> 03:48:10.560]   namely, what is the obstacle,
[03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:14.160]   or what has been the obstacle since the early 1970s.
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:18.260]   Since roughly 1974, the Palestinians have accepted
[03:48:18.260 --> 03:48:21.960]   the two-state settlement on the June 1967 border.
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:26.960]   Now, as it got, as more pressure was exerted on Israel,
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:30.720]   because the Palestinians seemed reasonable,
[03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:33.960]   the Israelis, to quote the Israeli political scientist,
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:36.760]   Avner Yaniv, he's since passed from the scene,
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:39.800]   he said, Yaniv in his book, "Dilemmas of Security,"
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:43.760]   he said that the big Israeli fear
[03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:47.880]   was what he called the Palestinian peace offensive.
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:49.360]   That was their worry,
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:53.840]   that the Palestinians were becoming too moderate.
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:56.400]   And unless you understand that,
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:49:00.880]   you can't understand the June 1982 Lebanon War.
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:04.080]   The purpose of the June 1982 Lebanon War
[03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:07.720]   was to liquidate the PLO in Southern Lebanon,
[03:49:07.720 --> 03:49:10.860]   because they were too moderate,
[03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:13.860]   the Palestinian peace offensive.
[03:49:13.860 --> 03:49:15.840]   I'm going to have to fast forward.
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:16.880]   There are many events.
[03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:20.400]   There was the first Intifada, then there's the Oslo Accord,
[03:49:20.400 --> 03:49:25.000]   and let's now go to the heart of the issue,
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.000]   namely, the 2000-2001 negotiations.
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:35.080]   Well, the negotiations are divided into three parts
[03:49:35.080 --> 03:49:37.840]   for the sake of listeners.
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:41.200]   There's Camp David in July 2000,
[03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:45.000]   there are the Clinton parameters in December 2000,
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:49.320]   and then there are negotiations in Taba in Egypt,
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:52.240]   Taba in Egypt in 2001.
[03:49:52.240 --> 03:49:54.640]   Those are the three phases.
[03:49:54.640 --> 03:49:57.200]   Now, I have studied the record
[03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:00.560]   probably to the point of insanity,
[03:50:00.560 --> 03:50:03.760]   because there are so many details you have to master.
[03:50:03.760 --> 03:50:06.640]   - I'll vouch for that, the insanity part.
[03:50:06.640 --> 03:50:08.640]   - Actually, I will vouch for it.
[03:50:08.640 --> 03:50:10.280]   I will personally vouch for it.
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:16.800]   There is one extensive record from that whole period
[03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:21.000]   from 2000 to, you could say, 2007,
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:24.540]   and that is what came to be called the Palestine Papers,
[03:50:24.540 --> 03:50:28.160]   which are about 15,000 pages
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:31.760]   of all the records of the negotiations.
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:36.080]   I have read through all of them, every single page,
[03:50:36.080 --> 03:50:38.440]   and this is what I find.
[03:50:38.440 --> 03:50:40.960]   If you look at Shlomo Ben-Ami's book,
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:43.920]   which I have with me, "Prophets Without Honor,"
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:48.920]   it's his last book, he says going into Camp David,
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:54.280]   that means July, going into Camp David, July 2000,
[03:50:54.280 --> 03:50:59.000]   he said the Israelis were willing to return about,
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:03.080]   not return, but will withdraw from 90, relinquish,
[03:51:03.080 --> 03:51:04.880]   92% of the West Bank.
[03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:06.280]   - Ben-Ami was at Camp David.
[03:51:06.280 --> 03:51:10.040]   - Yeah, Ben-Ami, he was at Taba.
[03:51:10.040 --> 03:51:11.800]   Oh yeah, he was also at Camp David.
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:15.820]   They wanted, Israel wanted to keep
[03:51:15.820 --> 03:51:17.880]   all the major settlement blocks.
[03:51:17.880 --> 03:51:23.800]   It wanted to keep roughly 8% of the West Bank,
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:29.640]   they were allowing for, you put it at 84 to 90%
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:35.160]   in your books, they put it at roughly 92%.
[03:51:35.160 --> 03:51:37.280]   Israel was willing to give up.
[03:51:37.280 --> 03:51:39.160]   - It also depends how you calculate.
[03:51:39.160 --> 03:51:40.000]   - Yeah, that was another issue.
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:41.960]   - It also depends what stage of Camp David,
[03:51:41.960 --> 03:51:43.080]   'cause there were two weeks.
[03:51:43.080 --> 03:51:44.520]   - Yeah, I'll get to that.
[03:51:44.520 --> 03:51:46.120]   - Proposals changed during those two weeks.
[03:51:46.120 --> 03:51:49.560]   - So Israel wants to keep all the major settlement blocks.
[03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:51.480]   - Means the border area of the West Bank.
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:54.040]   - Well, not the border, we have Ariel,
[03:51:54.040 --> 03:51:59.040]   we have Maale Adumim, we have as Condoleezza Rice
[03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:02.920]   called Ariel, she said it was a dagger
[03:52:02.920 --> 03:52:05.060]   into the heart of the West Bank.
[03:52:05.060 --> 03:52:10.060]   So they want to keep 8% of the land,
[03:52:10.060 --> 03:52:13.040]   they want to keep the settlement blocks,
[03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:17.320]   they want to keep 80% of the settlers,
[03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:22.160]   they will not budge an inch on the question of refugees.
[03:52:22.160 --> 03:52:27.000]   To quote Ehud Barak in the article he co-authored with you
[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:28.920]   in the New York Review of Books,
[03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:31.480]   we will accept, and I think the quote's accurate,
[03:52:31.480 --> 03:52:34.720]   no moral, legal, or historical responsibility
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:36.520]   for what happened to the refugees.
[03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:39.520]   So forget about even allowing refugees to return,
[03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:42.960]   we accept no moral, legal, or historical responsibility
[03:52:42.960 --> 03:52:44.280]   for the refugees.
[03:52:44.280 --> 03:52:47.360]   And on Jerusalem, they wanted to keep
[03:52:47.360 --> 03:52:50.240]   large parts of Jerusalem.
[03:52:50.240 --> 03:52:55.240]   Now, how do we judge who is reasonable and who is not?
[03:52:55.240 --> 03:53:00.880]   Ben-Ami says, "I think the Israeli offer was reasonable."
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:02.740]   That's how he sees it.
[03:53:02.740 --> 03:53:05.720]   But what is the standard of reasonable?
[03:53:05.720 --> 03:53:09.580]   My standard is, what does international law say?
[03:53:10.480 --> 03:53:14.340]   International law says the settlements are illegal.
[03:53:14.340 --> 03:53:19.400]   Israel wants to keep all the settlement blocks.
[03:53:19.400 --> 03:53:24.400]   15 judges, all 15, in the Wu decision in 2004,
[03:53:24.400 --> 03:53:28.640]   in July 2004, all 15 judges,
[03:53:28.640 --> 03:53:30.960]   including the American judge Bergenthal,
[03:53:30.960 --> 03:53:35.480]   ruled the settlements are illegal under international law.
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:40.520]   They want to keep 80% of the settlers.
[03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:42.520]   Under international law,
[03:53:42.520 --> 03:53:46.960]   all the settlers are illegal in the West Bank.
[03:53:46.960 --> 03:53:51.960]   They want to keep large parts of East Jerusalem.
[03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:55.520]   But under international law,
[03:53:55.520 --> 03:54:00.040]   East Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory.
[03:54:00.040 --> 03:54:01.480]   That's what the international--
[03:54:01.480 --> 03:54:03.920]   - No, not Palestinian, because there was no Palestine.
[03:54:03.920 --> 03:54:05.120]   - Okay, under--
[03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:06.960]   - There's never been a Palestinian state.
[03:54:06.960 --> 03:54:08.200]   How could it be Palestinian?
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:09.920]   - I listened patiently to you.
[03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:11.160]   - Sorry.
[03:54:11.160 --> 03:54:15.520]   - Under international law, if you read the decision,
[03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:20.520]   all territory, the 2004 war decision,
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:25.080]   all territory beyond the Green Line,
[03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:27.680]   which includes East Jerusalem,
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:31.960]   is occupied Palestinian territory.
[03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:34.040]   - Except in the Golan Heights.
[03:54:34.040 --> 03:54:35.720]   - The designated unit,
[03:54:35.720 --> 03:54:38.720]   according to the International Court of Justice,
[03:54:38.720 --> 03:54:43.040]   the designated unit for Palestinian self-determination.
[03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:48.880]   And they deny any right whatsoever on the right of return.
[03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:52.960]   The maximum, I don't want to go into the details now,
[03:54:52.960 --> 03:54:57.960]   the maximum formal offer was by Ehud Omar in 2008.
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:04.160]   He offered 5,000 refugees could return
[03:55:04.160 --> 03:55:07.480]   under what was called family reunification,
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:11.760]   5,000 in the course of five years,
[03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:15.960]   and no recognition of any Israeli responsibility.
[03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:19.520]   So if you use as the baseline
[03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:25.000]   what the UN General Assembly has said
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:29.240]   and what the International Court of Justice has said,
[03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:33.360]   if you use that baseline, international law,
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:38.240]   by that baseline, all the concessions
[03:55:38.240 --> 03:55:41.320]   came from the Palestinian side.
[03:55:41.320 --> 03:55:46.160]   Every single concession came from the Palestinian side.
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:49.280]   None came from the Israeli side.
[03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:54.280]   They may have accepted less than what they wanted,
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:55:59.400]   but it was still beyond
[03:55:59.400 --> 03:56:04.040]   what international law allocated to them.
[03:56:04.040 --> 03:56:05.520]   Now, you say--
[03:56:05.520 --> 03:56:06.360]   - Allocated to the Palestinians.
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:08.600]   - Allocated to the Palestinians, yes.
[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:10.520]   Thank you for the clarification.
[03:56:10.520 --> 03:56:13.120]   Now, about Arafat,
[03:56:13.120 --> 03:56:16.960]   like the mufti, never liked the guy.
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:19.720]   I think that was one of the only disagreements
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:22.320]   Muin and I had when Arafat passed.
[03:56:22.320 --> 03:56:25.000]   You were a little sentimental, I was not.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:26.360]   Never liked the guy.
[03:56:26.360 --> 03:56:29.280]   But politics, you don't have to like the guy.
[03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:33.120]   There was no question, nobody argues it,
[03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:36.840]   that whenever the negotiations started up,
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:39.880]   the Palestinians just kept saying the same things.
[03:56:39.880 --> 03:56:40.720]   - No.
[03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:41.560]   - No.
[03:56:41.560 --> 03:56:42.400]   - They kept saying no.
[03:56:42.400 --> 03:56:43.240]   - No.
[03:56:43.240 --> 03:56:46.160]   Professor Morris, with due respect, incorrect.
[03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:49.480]   They kept saying international legitimacy,
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:53.120]   international law, UN resolutions.
[03:56:53.120 --> 03:56:57.480]   They said, "We already gave you what the law required.
[03:56:57.480 --> 03:57:01.440]   "We gave that in 1988, November 1988,
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.680]   "and then ratified again at Oslo in 1993."
[03:57:05.680 --> 03:57:09.840]   And they said, "Now we want
[03:57:09.840 --> 03:57:14.840]   "what was promised us under international law."
[03:57:14.840 --> 03:57:16.760]   And that was the one point
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:19.640]   where everybody on the other side agreed.
[03:57:19.640 --> 03:57:23.800]   Clinton, "Don't talk to me about international law."
[03:57:23.800 --> 03:57:27.480]   Livni, during the Omar administration,
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:29.680]   she said, "I studied international law.
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:32.040]   "I don't believe in international law."
[03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:35.680]   Every single member on the other side,
[03:57:35.680 --> 03:57:39.480]   they didn't want to hear from international law.
[03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:44.480]   And to my thinking, that that is the only reasonable baseline
[03:57:45.920 --> 03:57:48.920]   for trying to resolve the conflict
[03:57:48.920 --> 03:57:51.440]   and Israel has, along with the U.S.
[03:57:51.440 --> 03:57:55.320]   - When has international law been relevant
[03:57:55.320 --> 03:57:57.400]   to any conflict, basically, in the world?
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:57:58.240]   - Hey, that's why--
[03:57:58.240 --> 03:57:59.080]   - Over the last 150 years.
[03:57:59.080 --> 03:58:01.760]   - That's why the Palestinians have to recognize Israel
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:03.240]   because that's international law.
[03:58:03.240 --> 03:58:04.680]   - No, but international laws are meaningless.
[03:58:04.680 --> 03:58:06.000]   - That was UN resolution 242.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.200]   - Conflicts are not solved by international law
[03:58:08.200 --> 03:58:09.840]   or in accordance with international law.
[03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:12.520]   - Yeah, but then, Professor Morris,
[03:58:12.520 --> 03:58:16.480]   for argument's sake, let's agree on that.
[03:58:16.480 --> 03:58:20.920]   Strictly for argument's sake, what's the alternative?
[03:58:20.920 --> 03:58:25.920]   Dennis Ross said, "We're going to decide who gets what
[03:58:25.920 --> 03:58:30.200]   "on the basis of needs."
[03:58:30.200 --> 03:58:33.480]   So he says, "Israel needs this, Israel needs that,
[03:58:33.480 --> 03:58:34.920]   "Israel needs that."
[03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:38.560]   Dennis Ross decided to be the philosopher king.
[03:58:38.560 --> 03:58:43.240]   He's going to decide on the basis of needs.
[03:58:43.240 --> 03:58:46.160]   Well, if you asked me, since Gaza's one
[03:58:46.160 --> 03:58:49.920]   of the densest places on Earth, it needs--
[03:58:49.920 --> 03:58:50.760]   - Tel Aviv.
[03:58:50.760 --> 03:58:51.600]   - Yes, it needs--
[03:58:51.600 --> 03:58:52.440]   - It needs part of Sinai.
[03:58:52.440 --> 03:58:53.960]   - It needs a nice big chunk--
[03:58:53.960 --> 03:58:55.160]   - Of Sinai.
[03:58:55.160 --> 03:58:56.280]   - Well, not Sinai.
[03:58:56.280 --> 03:58:57.440]   - That's what it actually needs.
[03:58:57.440 --> 03:59:00.560]   - Okay, I don't even wanna go there.
[03:59:00.560 --> 03:59:02.400]   It needs a nice big chunk,
[03:59:02.400 --> 03:59:06.400]   but I have to accept international law says no, okay?
[03:59:06.400 --> 03:59:08.060]   - International law is irrelevant.
[03:59:08.060 --> 03:59:12.560]   - Now, Ben-Ami says, "I think the Israeli offer
[03:59:12.560 --> 03:59:14.520]   "was reasonable."
[03:59:14.520 --> 03:59:16.440]   Okay, that's--
[03:59:16.440 --> 03:59:17.280]   - And he's a reasonable guy.
[03:59:17.280 --> 03:59:18.100]   - That's it.
[03:59:18.100 --> 03:59:18.940]   - You know that.
[03:59:18.940 --> 03:59:20.400]   - Even though, okay, I don't wanna go there.
[03:59:20.400 --> 03:59:23.240]   I've debated him and partly agree with you.
[03:59:23.240 --> 03:59:27.320]   But who decides what's reasonable?
[03:59:27.320 --> 03:59:30.160]   I think the international community
[03:59:30.160 --> 03:59:35.160]   in its political incarnation, the General Assembly,
[03:59:35.560 --> 03:59:39.460]   the Security Council, all those UN Security Council
[03:59:39.460 --> 03:59:42.180]   resolutions saying the settlements are illegal,
[03:59:42.180 --> 03:59:45.740]   annexation of East Jerusalem is null and void,
[03:59:45.740 --> 03:59:48.660]   and the International Court of Justice.
[03:59:48.660 --> 03:59:52.380]   That, to me, is a reasonable standard,
[03:59:52.380 --> 03:59:55.140]   and by that standard, the Palestinians
[03:59:55.140 --> 03:59:56.660]   were asked to make concessions,
[03:59:56.660 --> 03:59:59.060]   which I consider unreasonable,
[03:59:59.060 --> 04:00:01.900]   or the international community considers unreasonable.
[04:00:01.900 --> 04:00:04.420]   - I think that the issue is when you apply
[04:00:04.420 --> 04:00:06.680]   international law or international standards,
[04:00:06.680 --> 04:00:08.360]   I wouldn't say what Benny Morris says
[04:00:08.360 --> 04:00:10.000]   that they're irrelevant,
[04:00:10.000 --> 04:00:11.320]   but I think that these have to be seen
[04:00:11.320 --> 04:00:12.640]   as informing the conversation.
[04:00:12.640 --> 04:00:14.200]   I don't think these are the final shape
[04:00:14.200 --> 04:00:15.400]   of the conversation.
[04:00:15.400 --> 04:00:17.900]   I don't think historically Israel has ever negotiated
[04:00:17.900 --> 04:00:20.880]   within the strict bounds of whether we're talking
[04:00:20.880 --> 04:00:22.560]   Resolution 242, whether we're talking
[04:00:22.560 --> 04:00:24.720]   about any General Assembly resolutions.
[04:00:24.720 --> 04:00:28.040]   That's just not how these negotiations tend to go.
[04:00:28.040 --> 04:00:29.900]   You might consider international opinion on things,
[04:00:29.900 --> 04:00:30.740]   but at the end of the day,
[04:00:30.740 --> 04:00:32.240]   it's the bilateral negotiations,
[04:00:32.240 --> 04:00:33.960]   oftentimes historically started in secret,
[04:00:33.960 --> 04:00:36.240]   independent of the international community,
[04:00:36.240 --> 04:00:38.600]   that end up shaping what the final agreements look like.
[04:00:38.600 --> 04:00:40.200]   I think the issue with this broad appeal
[04:00:40.200 --> 04:00:42.880]   to international law is, again,
[04:00:42.880 --> 04:00:43.860]   going back to my earlier point
[04:00:43.860 --> 04:00:45.520]   about all of the euphemistic words,
[04:00:45.520 --> 04:00:48.600]   all it simply does is drive Palestinian expectations
[04:00:48.600 --> 04:00:52.320]   up to a level that is never going to be satisfied.
[04:00:52.320 --> 04:00:54.780]   For instance, you can throw that ICJ opinion all you want.
[04:00:54.780 --> 04:00:55.760]   It was an advisory opinion.
[04:00:55.760 --> 04:00:57.180]   That came in 2004.
[04:00:57.180 --> 04:00:59.480]   Have Palestinians gained more or less land
[04:00:59.480 --> 04:01:01.800]   since that 2004 advisory opinion was issued?
[04:01:01.800 --> 04:01:03.560]   - So what would your standard be then?
[04:01:03.560 --> 04:01:05.440]   Both sides have to have a delegation
[04:01:05.440 --> 04:01:06.380]   that confronts each other,
[04:01:06.380 --> 04:01:09.180]   and they assess the realistic conditions on the ground,
[04:01:09.180 --> 04:01:10.160]   and they try to figure out,
[04:01:10.160 --> 04:01:12.320]   within the confines of international law,
[04:01:12.320 --> 04:01:14.280]   and then what both sides are reasonable for.
[04:01:14.280 --> 04:01:16.680]   But for instance, this statement of full retreat
[04:01:16.680 --> 04:01:18.380]   from the West Bank, what is it, 400,000 settlers?
[04:01:18.380 --> 04:01:20.000]   How many settlers live in the West Bank now?
[04:01:20.000 --> 04:01:20.840]   - Probably half a million.
[04:01:20.840 --> 04:01:21.680]   - Yeah, you're gonna--
[04:01:21.680 --> 04:01:23.540]   - Depends if you include the Jerusalem suburbs or not.
[04:01:23.540 --> 04:01:25.120]   - Four or 500,000 people are never--
[04:01:25.120 --> 04:01:25.960]   - I think it's 700,000.
[04:01:25.960 --> 04:01:27.580]   - With the Jerusalem suburbs, perhaps.
[04:01:27.580 --> 04:01:28.420]   - Sure.
[04:01:28.420 --> 04:01:29.240]   - It is now called--
[04:01:29.240 --> 04:01:30.080]   - Half a million people are--
[04:01:30.080 --> 04:01:31.080]   - Jerusalem, not settlements.
[04:01:31.080 --> 04:01:32.880]   - I know that, but that's not what the law.
[04:01:32.880 --> 04:01:34.520]   The law calls it null and void.
[04:01:34.520 --> 04:01:35.360]   - Let me just--
[04:01:35.360 --> 04:01:36.200]   - We can say whatever we want
[04:01:36.200 --> 04:01:37.520]   until we're blue in the face,
[04:01:37.520 --> 04:01:39.560]   but like there's half a million Israeli people
[04:01:39.560 --> 04:01:40.400]   are not being expelled from the West Bank.
[04:01:40.400 --> 04:01:42.440]   - My response, you're basically saying,
[04:01:42.440 --> 04:01:44.000]   if I understand correctly,
[04:01:44.000 --> 04:01:45.680]   there's only one way to resolve this,
[04:01:45.680 --> 04:01:48.040]   and that is through direct bilateral negotiations.
[04:01:48.040 --> 04:01:48.880]   - Probably, yeah.
[04:01:48.880 --> 04:01:50.280]   - Okay, so--
[04:01:50.280 --> 04:01:51.120]   - Or ideally, but--
[04:01:51.120 --> 04:01:54.180]   - I've taken over your house, okay?
[04:01:54.180 --> 04:01:55.760]   You're not gonna go to the police
[04:01:55.760 --> 04:01:59.560]   because the law is only of limited value.
[04:01:59.560 --> 04:02:04.240]   So you come over and sit in what is now my living room
[04:02:04.240 --> 04:02:07.600]   that used to be your living room, and we negotiate.
[04:02:07.600 --> 04:02:11.000]   The problem there is that you're not gonna get anything
[04:02:11.000 --> 04:02:15.440]   unless I agree to it, and standards and norms
[04:02:15.440 --> 04:02:17.760]   and law and all the rest of it be damned.
[04:02:17.760 --> 04:02:20.920]   So you need to take into account
[04:02:20.920 --> 04:02:25.080]   that when you're advocating bilateral negotiations
[04:02:25.080 --> 04:02:29.800]   that effectively that gives each of the parties veto power.
[04:02:29.800 --> 04:02:33.120]   And in the current circumstances,
[04:02:33.120 --> 04:02:35.880]   the Palestinians have already recognized Israel.
[04:02:35.880 --> 04:02:38.720]   They have--
[04:02:38.720 --> 04:02:39.560]   - You keep bringing that up
[04:02:39.560 --> 04:02:40.840]   like it's a significant concession.
[04:02:40.840 --> 04:02:41.680]   - It's not true, it's not true.
[04:02:41.680 --> 04:02:42.520]   - And even if--
[04:02:42.520 --> 04:02:43.360]   - It's not even true.
[04:02:43.360 --> 04:02:44.320]   - It doesn't, but it doesn't,
[04:02:44.320 --> 04:02:48.400]   the recognition from Palestine isn't doing anything for--
[04:02:48.400 --> 04:02:49.520]   - Hamas totally rejects--
[04:02:49.520 --> 04:02:50.560]   - I'm not talking about Hamas.
[04:02:50.560 --> 04:02:53.600]   - Hamas is the majority among the Palestinian people.
[04:02:53.600 --> 04:02:55.760]   They won the elections in 2006.
[04:02:55.760 --> 04:02:56.600]   Every opinion--
[04:02:56.600 --> 04:02:57.960]   - They won a majority of the seats.
[04:02:57.960 --> 04:02:58.800]   - Yes, exactly.
[04:02:58.800 --> 04:02:59.640]   - They didn't win a majority of the votes.
[04:02:59.640 --> 04:03:01.880]   - Every opinion poll today says the majority
[04:03:01.880 --> 04:03:03.880]   of Palestinians support the Hamas.
[04:03:03.880 --> 04:03:04.720]   - That sounds right.
[04:03:04.720 --> 04:03:06.320]   - The Hamas absolutely rejects Israel.
[04:03:06.320 --> 04:03:10.960]   So if Arafat, in 1993 or whatever,
[04:03:10.960 --> 04:03:12.800]   issued a sort of recognition of Israel--
[04:03:12.800 --> 04:03:13.640]   - It wasn't a sort of recognition.
[04:03:13.640 --> 04:03:16.400]   - Okay, a recognition of Israel, it's meaningless.
[04:03:16.400 --> 04:03:17.240]   It's meaningless.
[04:03:17.240 --> 04:03:18.080]   - It's meaningless.
[04:03:18.080 --> 04:03:19.360]   - And anyhow, I don't believe
[04:03:19.360 --> 04:03:21.120]   that Arafat was sincere about it.
[04:03:21.120 --> 04:03:22.600]   - Does it matter what you or I think
[04:03:22.600 --> 04:03:23.760]   about what you felt? - No, most Israelis do
[04:03:23.760 --> 04:03:24.720]   and that does matter.
[04:03:24.720 --> 04:03:25.560]   - Okay, so--
[04:03:25.560 --> 04:03:26.400]   - That does matter.
[04:03:26.400 --> 04:03:28.600]   But Hamas says no and Hamas is the majority--
[04:03:28.600 --> 04:03:33.600]   - So for years, the Israeli and U.S. demand
[04:03:33.600 --> 04:03:38.960]   was that the Palestinians recognize 24238.
[04:03:38.960 --> 04:03:40.960]   They did, but you're saying,
[04:03:40.960 --> 04:03:42.600]   okay, we demanded that they do this,
[04:03:42.600 --> 04:03:44.600]   but it was meaningless when they did it.
[04:03:44.600 --> 04:03:46.200]   Then the demand was that--
[04:03:46.200 --> 04:03:47.320]   - It was a tactical thing, yes.
[04:03:47.320 --> 04:03:51.160]   - Then the demand was that the PLO recognize Israel.
[04:03:51.160 --> 04:03:52.000]   - Tactical.
[04:03:52.000 --> 04:03:53.640]   They demanded that they did this
[04:03:53.640 --> 04:03:55.440]   and they did it, but it's meaningless.
[04:03:55.440 --> 04:03:57.280]   - And they never changed their charter, the PLO.
[04:03:57.280 --> 04:03:58.480]   You may remember that.
[04:03:58.480 --> 04:03:59.320]   - In fact, in 19--
[04:03:59.320 --> 04:04:01.600]   - They supposedly abrogated the old charter,
[04:04:01.600 --> 04:04:03.000]   but never came up with a new one.
[04:04:03.000 --> 04:04:03.840]   - No, but--
[04:04:03.840 --> 04:04:04.680]   - So there was no new charter.
[04:04:04.680 --> 04:04:05.520]   - But in 1996--
[04:04:05.520 --> 04:04:06.880]   - And Farouk Haddoumi said, of course,
[04:04:06.880 --> 04:04:08.680]   the old charter is still in force.
[04:04:08.680 --> 04:04:09.520]   - Yes, yes.
[04:04:09.520 --> 04:04:12.840]   But the point is, the Palestinians,
[04:04:12.840 --> 04:04:15.560]   demands are constantly made of them.
[04:04:15.560 --> 04:04:16.400]   And when they--
[04:04:16.400 --> 04:04:17.240]   - And of Israel.
[04:04:17.240 --> 04:04:19.240]   - And when they accede to those demands,
[04:04:19.240 --> 04:04:21.520]   they're then told, actually, what you did is meaningless.
[04:04:21.520 --> 04:04:23.120]   So here's a new set of demands.
[04:04:23.120 --> 04:04:24.480]   I mean, you know, it's like a hamster.
[04:04:24.480 --> 04:04:25.320]   - There's no new set of demands.
[04:04:25.320 --> 04:04:26.160]   - It's like a hamster.
[04:04:26.160 --> 04:04:27.000]   - Let me, let me--
[04:04:27.000 --> 04:04:28.680]   - It's like a hamster stuck in a wheel.
[04:04:28.680 --> 04:04:29.520]   - Let me tell you what the bottom line is.
[04:04:29.520 --> 04:04:31.120]   - That will be told, if you run fast enough,
[04:04:31.120 --> 04:04:32.080]   you'll get out of the cage.
[04:04:32.080 --> 04:04:32.920]   - No, no.
[04:04:32.920 --> 04:04:36.560]   The bottom line is that Israel would like
[04:04:36.560 --> 04:04:38.400]   a Palestinian Sadat.
[04:04:38.400 --> 04:04:40.120]   It wants the Palestinians--
[04:04:40.120 --> 04:04:40.960]   Listen, listen, just let me finish.
[04:04:40.960 --> 04:04:42.640]   - This is really a worst-case scenario
[04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:43.480]   you're talking about now.
[04:04:43.480 --> 04:04:44.480]   - Okay, let me just, yeah, 'cause they shot Sadat.
[04:04:44.480 --> 04:04:47.720]   But anyhow, the Israelis want--
[04:04:47.720 --> 04:04:48.560]   - For good reason?
[04:04:48.560 --> 04:04:49.960]   - Want the Palestinians.
[04:04:49.960 --> 04:04:54.680]   Israelis want the Palestinians to actually accept
[04:04:54.680 --> 04:04:56.760]   the legitimacy of the state of Israel
[04:04:56.760 --> 04:04:58.200]   and the Zionist project,
[04:04:58.200 --> 04:05:00.720]   and then live side-by-side with them in two states.
[04:05:00.720 --> 04:05:01.880]   That's what the Israelis--
[04:05:01.880 --> 04:05:02.960]   I don't even know if it's true.
[04:05:02.960 --> 04:05:03.800]   - And what is the formal position--
[04:05:03.800 --> 04:05:04.920]   - I don't even know if that's true today.
[04:05:04.920 --> 04:05:06.480]   - And what is the formal position
[04:05:06.480 --> 04:05:08.640]   of this Israeli government?
[04:05:08.640 --> 04:05:09.920]   - No, no, I'm saying I don't know if it exists today.
[04:05:09.920 --> 04:05:13.040]   - Okay, it's predecessor, and it's predecessor,
[04:05:13.040 --> 04:05:14.240]   and it's predecessor.
[04:05:14.240 --> 04:05:15.080]   Come on.
[04:05:15.080 --> 04:05:15.920]   - That's what Israelis want.
[04:05:15.920 --> 04:05:18.760]   They want a change of psyche among the Palestinians.
[04:05:18.760 --> 04:05:20.000]   - Muin has an interesting--
[04:05:20.000 --> 04:05:20.840]   - And if that doesn't happen,
[04:05:20.840 --> 04:05:22.040]   there won't be a Palestinian state.
[04:05:22.040 --> 04:05:26.440]   - Muin, Muin has an interesting point.
[04:05:26.440 --> 04:05:27.280]   - Forget international law.
[04:05:27.280 --> 04:05:31.160]   - Because I found, I found, I know you want to forget it,
[04:05:31.160 --> 04:05:33.680]   just like you want to forget the genocide charge.
[04:05:33.680 --> 04:05:34.920]   I know you want to forget that.
[04:05:34.920 --> 04:05:36.200]   - Well, the Palestinians want to forget it, too,
[04:05:36.200 --> 04:05:37.040]   and it doesn't suit them as well, right?
[04:05:37.040 --> 04:05:38.840]   - Okay, but here's the problem,
[04:05:38.840 --> 04:05:42.360]   and it's exactly the problem that Muin just brought up.
[04:05:42.360 --> 04:05:44.960]   Now, I read carefully your book, "One State, Two States."
[04:05:44.960 --> 04:05:48.000]   With all due respect, absolutely a disgrace.
[04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:50.520]   Coming from you, coming from you--
[04:05:50.520 --> 04:05:52.080]   - Most reviewers didn't agree with you, though.
[04:05:52.080 --> 04:05:55.120]   - Yeah, coming from you was like you wrote it in your sleep.
[04:05:55.120 --> 04:05:58.000]   It's nothing compared to what you wrote before.
[04:05:58.000 --> 04:05:59.360]   I don't know why you did it.
[04:05:59.360 --> 04:06:01.400]   In my opinion, you ruined your reputation.
[04:06:01.400 --> 04:06:04.480]   Not totally, but you undermined it with that book.
[04:06:04.480 --> 04:06:07.600]   But let's get to the issue that Muin wrote.
[04:06:07.600 --> 04:06:10.000]   Here's what you said.
[04:06:10.000 --> 04:06:14.640]   You said, formally, you said, "Yes, it's true.
[04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:17.480]   "The Palestinians recognize Israel."
[04:06:17.480 --> 04:06:20.800]   But then you said, "Viscerally, in their hearts,
[04:06:20.800 --> 04:06:23.560]   "they didn't really recognize Israel."
[04:06:23.560 --> 04:06:28.560]   So I thought to myself, how does Professor Morrison know
[04:06:28.560 --> 04:06:31.880]   what's in the hearts of Palestinians?
[04:06:31.880 --> 04:06:32.720]   I don't know.
[04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:38.200]   I was surprised, as a historian,
[04:06:38.200 --> 04:06:39.880]   you would be talking about what's lurking
[04:06:39.880 --> 04:06:41.680]   in the hearts of Palestinians.
[04:06:41.680 --> 04:06:44.920]   But then you said something which was really interesting.
[04:06:44.920 --> 04:06:49.920]   You said, "Even if in their hearts they accepted Israel,"
[04:06:49.920 --> 04:06:55.040]   you said, quote, "Rationally, they could never accept Israel
[04:06:55.040 --> 04:06:57.000]   "because they got nothing.
[04:06:57.000 --> 04:06:59.200]   "They had this beautiful Palestine,
[04:06:59.200 --> 04:07:01.840]   "and now they're reduced to just a few pieces,
[04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.480]   "a few parcels of land."
[04:07:03.480 --> 04:07:04.880]   - So they will never accept it.
[04:07:04.880 --> 04:07:08.840]   - So yes, so you said there's no way they can accept it.
[04:07:08.840 --> 04:07:11.080]   - No, I would say that as well.
[04:07:11.080 --> 04:07:13.640]   The two-state solution, as proposed,
[04:07:13.640 --> 04:07:14.960]   doesn't make any sense.
[04:07:14.960 --> 04:07:19.960]   - Exactly as Muin said, you keep moving the goalposts
[04:07:19.960 --> 04:07:24.840]   until we reach the point where we realize,
[04:07:24.840 --> 04:07:29.240]   according to Benny Morris, there can't be a solution.
[04:07:29.240 --> 04:07:31.800]   So why don't you just say that outright?
[04:07:31.800 --> 04:07:35.320]   Why don't you say it outright, that according to you,
[04:07:35.320 --> 04:07:40.320]   the Palestinians can never be reasonable?
[04:07:41.280 --> 04:07:42.840]   Because according to you--
[04:07:42.840 --> 04:07:44.600]   - They want all of Palestine.
[04:07:44.600 --> 04:07:49.240]   - According to you, they couldn't possibly agree
[04:07:49.240 --> 04:07:51.000]   to a two-state settlement
[04:07:51.000 --> 04:07:53.800]   because it's such a lousy settlement.
[04:07:53.800 --> 04:07:55.240]   - 'Cause they want all of Palestine.
[04:07:55.240 --> 04:07:58.800]   - But you said, "Rationally, they couldn't accept it."
[04:07:58.800 --> 04:08:00.440]   Not their feelings.
[04:08:00.440 --> 04:08:01.280]   - It's both.
[04:08:01.280 --> 04:08:02.100]   - You said, "Rational."
[04:08:02.100 --> 04:08:06.480]   You went from formally, viscerally, rationally.
[04:08:06.480 --> 04:08:08.520]   So now we're reaching the point
[04:08:08.520 --> 04:08:10.760]   where according to Benny Morris,
[04:08:10.760 --> 04:08:15.320]   the Palestinians can't be reasonable
[04:08:15.320 --> 04:08:20.120]   because reasonably, they have to reject two states.
[04:08:20.120 --> 04:08:20.960]   - They want all of Palestine.
[04:08:20.960 --> 04:08:22.960]   - So Muin is absolutely correct.
[04:08:22.960 --> 04:08:24.640]   There's no way to resolve the problem
[04:08:24.640 --> 04:08:25.480]   according to your logic.
[04:08:25.480 --> 04:08:26.300]   - They want all of Palestine.
[04:08:26.300 --> 04:08:27.140]   He said that himself.
[04:08:27.140 --> 04:08:28.680]   He said they should dismantle Israel.
[04:08:28.680 --> 04:08:29.520]   That's what he's saying.
[04:08:29.520 --> 04:08:30.360]   - I'm talking about--
[04:08:30.360 --> 04:08:31.200]   - What I said.
[04:08:31.200 --> 04:08:32.020]   - You didn't say that.
[04:08:32.020 --> 04:08:32.860]   - Dismantle Israel.
[04:08:32.860 --> 04:08:34.560]   - What I said, and I've written--
[04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:35.960]   - I'm glad you didn't deny it.
[04:08:36.480 --> 04:08:38.840]   - I've written extensively on this issue,
[04:08:38.840 --> 04:08:43.840]   on why a two-state settlement is still feasible.
[04:08:43.840 --> 04:08:47.160]   And I came out in support of that proposition.
[04:08:47.160 --> 04:08:51.500]   Perhaps in my heart, you can see that I was just bullshitting
[04:08:51.500 --> 04:08:53.420]   but that's what I actually wrote.
[04:08:53.420 --> 04:08:55.960]   That was a number of years ago.
[04:08:55.960 --> 04:08:58.180]   And just as a matter of historical record,
[04:08:58.180 --> 04:09:02.920]   beginning in the early 1970s,
[04:09:02.920 --> 04:09:04.320]   there was fierce debate
[04:09:04.320 --> 04:09:07.120]   within the Palestinian National Movement
[04:09:07.120 --> 04:09:10.200]   about whether to accept or reject.
[04:09:10.200 --> 04:09:12.240]   And there were three schools of thought.
[04:09:12.240 --> 04:09:14.540]   There was one that would accept nothing less
[04:09:14.540 --> 04:09:17.240]   than the total liberation of Palestine.
[04:09:17.240 --> 04:09:19.320]   There was a second that accepted
[04:09:19.320 --> 04:09:20.720]   what was called the establishment
[04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:23.820]   of a fighting national authority on Palestinian soil,
[04:09:23.820 --> 04:09:25.720]   which they saw as the beginning--
[04:09:25.720 --> 04:09:26.560]   - As a springboard.
[04:09:26.560 --> 04:09:28.480]   - As a springboard for the total liberation of Palestine.
[04:09:28.480 --> 04:09:30.320]   And there was a third school
[04:09:30.320 --> 04:09:33.720]   that believed that under current dynamics and so on,
[04:09:33.720 --> 04:09:37.880]   that they should go for a two-state settlement.
[04:09:37.880 --> 04:09:42.480]   And our friend and correspondent, Gauter Loerse,
[04:09:42.480 --> 04:09:45.160]   has written a very perceptive article
[04:09:45.160 --> 04:09:49.040]   on when the PLO, already in 1976,
[04:09:49.040 --> 04:09:54.040]   came out in open support of a two-state resolution
[04:09:54.040 --> 04:09:56.680]   at the Security Council.
[04:09:56.680 --> 04:09:58.120]   PLO accepted it.
[04:09:58.120 --> 04:10:00.120]   Israel, of course, rejected it.
[04:10:00.120 --> 04:10:01.880]   But the resolution didn't pass
[04:10:01.880 --> 04:10:04.020]   because the U.S. and the U.K. vetoed it.
[04:10:04.020 --> 04:10:04.860]   It was both of them.
[04:10:04.860 --> 04:10:06.400]   - I think it was nine to five.
[04:10:06.400 --> 04:10:08.600]   - Ah, okay, yeah.
[04:10:08.600 --> 04:10:11.800]   But the fact of the matter is
[04:10:11.800 --> 04:10:16.800]   that the PLO came to accept a two-state settlement.
[04:10:16.800 --> 04:10:20.320]   Why they did it, I think, is irrelevant.
[04:10:20.320 --> 04:10:25.680]   And subsequently, the PLO acted on the basis
[04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:27.560]   of seeking to achieve a two-state settlement.
[04:10:27.560 --> 04:10:29.720]   The reason, I think, and I think, Norm,
[04:10:29.720 --> 04:10:31.400]   you've written about this,
[04:10:31.400 --> 04:10:35.560]   the reason that Arafat was so insistent
[04:10:35.560 --> 04:10:40.080]   on getting minimally acceptable terms
[04:10:40.080 --> 04:10:44.000]   for a two-state settlement at Camp David and afterwards
[04:10:44.000 --> 04:10:47.240]   was precisely because he knew that once he signed,
[04:10:47.240 --> 04:10:49.800]   that was all the Palestinians were going to get.
[04:10:49.800 --> 04:10:54.660]   If his intention had been, I'm not accepting Israel,
[04:10:54.660 --> 04:10:56.160]   I simply want to springboard,
[04:10:56.160 --> 04:10:59.480]   he would have accepted a Palestinian state in Jericho.
[04:10:59.480 --> 04:11:00.320]   But he didn't.
[04:11:00.320 --> 04:11:01.140]   He insisted-- - That's something
[04:11:01.140 --> 04:11:02.240]   I've never understood.
[04:11:02.240 --> 04:11:05.240]   He should have logically accepted the springboard
[04:11:05.240 --> 04:11:06.380]   and then from there launched his next statement.
[04:11:06.380 --> 04:11:08.140]   - No, he understood what you don't understand.
[04:11:08.140 --> 04:11:10.960]   He understood that international law
[04:11:10.960 --> 04:11:13.660]   would put a real constraint on him.
[04:11:13.660 --> 04:11:15.200]   - No, but also-- - Once he accepted,
[04:11:15.200 --> 04:11:16.520]   it was over. - I think constitutionally,
[04:11:16.520 --> 04:11:17.680]   he was incapable of signing.
[04:11:17.680 --> 04:11:18.760]   - Well, I don't know that.
[04:11:18.760 --> 04:11:19.600]   If that's-- - You're right.
[04:11:19.600 --> 04:11:21.360]   - I'm not his analyst. - He should have accepted it.
[04:11:21.360 --> 04:11:23.160]   - But if you're correct, okay,
[04:11:23.160 --> 04:11:25.960]   that he was really out to--
[04:11:25.960 --> 04:11:27.320]   - Eliminate Israel. - Eliminate Israel,
[04:11:27.320 --> 04:11:29.920]   then he wouldn't have cared about the borders.
[04:11:29.920 --> 04:11:31.600]   He wouldn't have cared about what the thing said
[04:11:31.600 --> 04:11:32.440]   about refugees.
[04:11:32.440 --> 04:11:33.960]   He would have gotten a sovereign state
[04:11:33.960 --> 04:11:36.280]   and used that to achieve that purpose.
[04:11:36.280 --> 04:11:39.320]   But I think it was precisely because he recognized
[04:11:39.320 --> 04:11:41.400]   that he was not negotiating for a springboard.
[04:11:41.400 --> 04:11:44.280]   He was negotiating permanent status
[04:11:44.280 --> 04:11:47.560]   that he was such a stickler about the details.
[04:11:47.560 --> 04:11:49.680]   The second-- - Just as a factual matter,
[04:11:49.680 --> 04:11:52.720]   he wasn't such a stickler.
[04:11:52.720 --> 04:11:55.040]   When they asked him how many refugees,
[04:11:55.040 --> 04:11:57.160]   the numbers-- - It was a principle
[04:11:57.160 --> 04:11:58.360]   rather than the numbers. - It was the principle.
[04:11:58.360 --> 04:12:00.040]   - He said I would be pragmatic about it.
[04:12:00.040 --> 04:12:05.040]   - Yes, and the numbers that were used at Annapolis
[04:12:05.040 --> 04:12:10.360]   were between 100 and 250,000 refugees over 10 years.
[04:12:10.360 --> 04:12:11.840]   That was the number.
[04:12:11.840 --> 04:12:15.400]   Arafat, when he was asked at Camp David,
[04:12:15.400 --> 04:12:19.440]   he kept saying, "I care about the Lebanese,
[04:12:19.440 --> 04:12:21.040]   "the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,"
[04:12:21.040 --> 04:12:23.240]   which came to about 300,000. - It was a risk priority.
[04:12:23.240 --> 04:12:26.560]   - Which was a large concession from,
[04:12:26.560 --> 04:12:28.360]   whether you accept the number or not,
[04:12:28.360 --> 04:12:30.720]   that he wasn't talking about six million.
[04:12:30.720 --> 04:12:35.720]   He was talking about between 100 and 250,000 over 10 years.
[04:12:35.720 --> 04:12:39.360]   Now, the best offer that came from the Palestinians,
[04:12:39.360 --> 04:12:42.440]   excuse me, the best offer that came from Israel
[04:12:42.440 --> 04:12:44.720]   was the Olmert offer.
[04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:47.680]   - Can we just pretend like we didn't all lay out
[04:12:47.680 --> 04:12:51.960]   the exceptionally pessimistic view of a two-state,
[04:12:51.960 --> 04:12:53.200]   hold on a second, two-state solution.
[04:12:53.200 --> 04:12:57.080]   Let's pretend that in five years, in 10 years,
[04:12:57.080 --> 04:13:00.340]   a two-state peace settlement is reached,
[04:13:00.340 --> 04:13:04.360]   and as historians, you'll still be here
[04:13:04.360 --> 04:13:06.360]   and writing about it 20 years from now.
[04:13:06.360 --> 04:13:08.100]   How would it have happened?
[04:13:08.100 --> 04:13:11.880]   - I think that historically, I think that the big issue is,
[04:13:11.880 --> 04:13:13.400]   I think that both sides have had
[04:13:13.400 --> 04:13:15.280]   their own internal motivations to fight
[04:13:15.280 --> 04:13:17.240]   because they feel like they have something to gain from it,
[04:13:17.240 --> 04:13:19.000]   but I think as time has gone on,
[04:13:19.000 --> 04:13:20.480]   unfortunately, the record proves
[04:13:20.480 --> 04:13:22.680]   that the Palestinian side is delusional.
[04:13:22.680 --> 04:13:24.640]   The longer that the conflict endures,
[04:13:24.640 --> 04:13:26.160]   the worse position they'll be in,
[04:13:26.160 --> 04:13:28.460]   but for some reason, they've never had a leader
[04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:30.280]   that convinced them of that as much.
[04:13:30.280 --> 04:13:32.020]   That Arafat thought that if he held on,
[04:13:32.020 --> 04:13:34.240]   there was always a better deal around the corner.
[04:13:34.240 --> 04:13:36.280]   Abbas is more concerned with trying to maintain
[04:13:36.280 --> 04:13:38.040]   any legitimacy amongst Palestinians
[04:13:38.040 --> 04:13:40.020]   than actually trying to negotiate
[04:13:40.020 --> 04:13:41.240]   anything realistic with Israel.
[04:13:41.240 --> 04:13:43.300]   That Palestinians are always incentivized
[04:13:43.300 --> 04:13:45.140]   to feel like as long as they keep fighting,
[04:13:45.140 --> 04:13:47.460]   either the international community is going to save them
[04:13:47.460 --> 04:13:50.280]   with the five millionth UN resolution condemning whatever,
[04:13:50.280 --> 04:13:52.160]   that another ICJ advisory opinion
[04:13:52.160 --> 04:13:53.840]   is finally going to lead to the expulsion
[04:13:53.840 --> 04:13:56.040]   of half a million Jews from the West Bank,
[04:13:56.040 --> 04:13:58.020]   or that some other international body,
[04:13:58.020 --> 04:13:59.440]   the ICJ and the genocide charge
[04:13:59.440 --> 04:14:00.700]   is gonna come and save the Palestinians.
[04:14:00.700 --> 04:14:02.480]   As long as they, in their mind,
[04:14:02.480 --> 04:14:04.280]   feel like somebody is coming to save them,
[04:14:04.280 --> 04:14:06.180]   then they feel like they're going to have the ability
[04:14:06.180 --> 04:14:07.440]   to get something better in the future,
[04:14:07.440 --> 04:14:09.760]   but the reality is, is all of the good partners
[04:14:09.760 --> 04:14:11.120]   for peace that the Palestinians had
[04:14:11.120 --> 04:14:14.200]   have completely and utterly abandoned them.
[04:14:14.200 --> 04:14:17.320]   Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf States,
[04:14:17.320 --> 04:14:18.640]   whether you're talking bilateral peace
[04:14:18.640 --> 04:14:19.760]   or the Abraham Accords,
[04:14:19.760 --> 04:14:22.400]   most of the Arab leaders in negotiating peace with Israel
[04:14:22.400 --> 04:14:24.240]   have just not had as much of an interest
[04:14:24.240 --> 04:14:28.240]   in maintaining the rights and the representations
[04:14:28.240 --> 04:14:29.280]   of what the Palestinian people want,
[04:14:29.280 --> 04:14:30.720]   and the only people they have today
[04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:32.760]   to draw legitimacy from,
[04:14:32.760 --> 04:14:34.700]   or to have on their side to argue with them,
[04:14:34.700 --> 04:14:37.400]   are people that, I guess, write books or tweet,
[04:14:37.400 --> 04:14:39.640]   or people in the international community
[04:14:39.640 --> 04:14:42.000]   that do resolutions or amnesty international reports.
[04:14:42.000 --> 04:14:42.840]   And the reality is,
[04:14:42.840 --> 04:14:44.680]   we can scream until we're blue in the face on these things,
[04:14:44.680 --> 04:14:46.280]   none of it has gotten any closer
[04:14:46.280 --> 04:14:48.480]   to helping the Palestinians in any sense of the word.
[04:14:48.480 --> 04:14:49.920]   The condition has only gotten worse.
[04:14:49.920 --> 04:14:51.700]   The settlements only continue to expand.
[04:14:51.700 --> 04:14:54.400]   The military operations are only to get more brutal.
[04:14:54.400 --> 04:14:56.700]   The blockade is going to continue to have worse effects.
[04:14:56.700 --> 04:14:59.280]   As long as we use international law as the basis,
[04:14:59.280 --> 04:15:01.720]   and there isn't a strong, a Sadat-like Palestinian leader
[04:15:01.720 --> 04:15:03.920]   that's willing to come up and confront Israel
[04:15:03.920 --> 04:15:06.820]   with the brave, peaceful negotiations
[04:15:06.820 --> 04:15:09.600]   to force them to acquiesce, nothing is going to happen.
[04:15:09.600 --> 04:15:11.880]   And I think that the issue you come up with is,
[04:15:11.880 --> 04:15:12.920]   whether it's people like Norm
[04:15:12.920 --> 04:15:15.120]   that talk about how brave the October 7th attacks were,
[04:15:15.120 --> 04:15:17.360]   or how much respect they have for those fighters,
[04:15:17.360 --> 04:15:19.680]   the Israel in a way,
[04:15:19.680 --> 04:15:21.920]   and I think people have said as much about Netanyahu,
[04:15:21.920 --> 04:15:24.160]   the right wants violence from the Palestinians
[04:15:24.160 --> 04:15:26.000]   because it always gives them a perpetual excuse
[04:15:26.000 --> 04:15:27.280]   to further the conflict.
[04:15:27.280 --> 04:15:29.280]   Well, we have to go in on October 7th,
[04:15:29.280 --> 04:15:30.120]   and we've got to remove Hamas,
[04:15:30.120 --> 04:15:31.320]   but we can't trust these people in the West.
[04:15:31.320 --> 04:15:33.460]   We have to do the night raids because of, you know,
[04:15:33.460 --> 04:15:35.480]   the second Intifada, you know,
[04:15:35.480 --> 04:15:36.760]   made us feel like the Palestinian people
[04:15:36.760 --> 04:15:38.040]   didn't want trust with us.
[04:15:38.040 --> 04:15:41.140]   I feel like the biggest thing that would force Israel
[04:15:41.140 --> 04:15:44.480]   to change its path would be an actual, a real,
[04:15:44.480 --> 04:15:45.700]   not for like two weeks,
[04:15:45.700 --> 04:15:48.000]   but an actual peaceful Palestinian leader,
[04:15:48.000 --> 04:15:49.240]   somebody committed to peace
[04:15:49.240 --> 04:15:51.220]   that is able to apply those standards
[04:15:51.220 --> 04:15:53.880]   and hold the entire region of Palestine to those standards.
[04:15:53.880 --> 04:15:55.420]   Because I think over time,
[04:15:55.420 --> 04:15:57.640]   the mounting pressure from without
[04:15:57.640 --> 04:15:59.160]   the international community
[04:15:59.160 --> 04:16:00.500]   and the mounting pressure from within,
[04:16:00.500 --> 04:16:02.360]   because Israel hosts a lot of its own criticism.
[04:16:02.360 --> 04:16:04.200]   If we talk about B'Tselem, we talk about Horetz,
[04:16:04.200 --> 04:16:05.760]   like Israel will host a lot of its own criticism.
[04:16:05.760 --> 04:16:07.520]   I think that that pressure would force Israel
[04:16:07.520 --> 04:16:09.840]   towards an actual peace agreement,
[04:16:09.840 --> 04:16:11.460]   but it's never going to come through violence.
[04:16:11.460 --> 04:16:13.120]   Historically, it hasn't.
[04:16:13.120 --> 04:16:14.280]   And in the modern day,
[04:16:14.280 --> 04:16:16.180]   violence has just hurt the Palestinians more and more.
[04:16:16.180 --> 04:16:18.060]   - If you paint a picture of the future,
[04:16:18.060 --> 04:16:21.660]   now's a good moment for both Palestine and Israel
[04:16:21.660 --> 04:16:23.540]   to get new leadership.
[04:16:23.540 --> 04:16:25.300]   Netanyahu's on the way out.
[04:16:25.300 --> 04:16:27.340]   Hamas possibly is on the way out.
[04:16:27.340 --> 04:16:29.900]   Who should rise to the top
[04:16:29.900 --> 04:16:32.500]   such that a peaceful settlement can be reached?
[04:16:32.500 --> 04:16:34.300]   - The problem is like Benny said, yeah,
[04:16:34.300 --> 04:16:36.140]   it's difficult because Hamas enjoys
[04:16:36.140 --> 04:16:40.580]   so much widespread support amongst the Palestinian people.
[04:16:40.580 --> 04:16:42.180]   I think that the, well, I don't know.
[04:16:42.180 --> 04:16:43.380]   There's opinions on whether democracy
[04:16:43.380 --> 04:16:44.520]   or pushing them towards elections
[04:16:44.520 --> 04:16:45.840]   was the right or wrong idea,
[04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:49.000]   but with like an Islamic fundamentalist government for Hamas,
[04:16:49.000 --> 04:16:50.840]   I don't know if a negotiation with Israel
[04:16:50.840 --> 04:16:51.880]   ever happens there.
[04:16:51.880 --> 04:16:54.320]   And then when the international pressure is always,
[04:16:54.320 --> 04:16:57.500]   you know, 67 borders, infinite right of return for refugees,
[04:16:57.500 --> 04:16:59.840]   and a total withdrawal of Israel from all these lands
[04:16:59.840 --> 04:17:01.960]   to even start negotiations,
[04:17:01.960 --> 04:17:04.520]   I just don't see realistically that on the Palestinian side,
[04:17:04.520 --> 04:17:06.320]   no negotiations are ever going to start
[04:17:06.320 --> 04:17:08.920]   in a place that Israel's willing to accept.
[04:17:08.920 --> 04:17:13.040]   - If you want to dismiss international law,
[04:17:13.040 --> 04:17:16.640]   that's fine, but then you have to do it consistently.
[04:17:16.640 --> 04:17:20.680]   You can't set standards for the Palestinians,
[04:17:20.680 --> 04:17:25.960]   but reject applying those standards to Israel.
[04:17:25.960 --> 04:17:29.920]   If we're going to have the law of the jungle,
[04:17:29.920 --> 04:17:33.580]   then we can all be beasts, and not only some of us.
[04:17:33.580 --> 04:17:36.360]   And I think, so it's either that,
[04:17:36.360 --> 04:17:40.480]   or you have certain agreed standards
[04:17:40.480 --> 04:17:43.040]   that are intended to regulate our conduct,
[04:17:43.040 --> 04:17:45.880]   all of our conduct, not just some of us.
[04:17:45.880 --> 04:17:46.720]   So that's a fundamental-
[04:17:46.720 --> 04:17:48.400]   - What are the standards you think I'm saying to abandon?
[04:17:48.400 --> 04:17:49.440]   - Well, you're saying, you know,
[04:17:49.440 --> 04:17:51.720]   international law and the millionth UN resolution,
[04:17:51.720 --> 04:17:53.820]   you're being very dismissive about all these things.
[04:17:53.820 --> 04:17:57.000]   And that's fine, but then you have to be dismissive
[04:17:57.000 --> 04:17:57.840]   across the board.
[04:17:57.840 --> 04:17:59.960]   - That was a chapter six resolution, that's a non-binding.
[04:17:59.960 --> 04:18:03.120]   - But 242 is binding, it's absolutely not binding.
[04:18:03.120 --> 04:18:04.520]   - What is binding?
[04:18:04.520 --> 04:18:07.240]   Do you know anything about how the UN system works?
[04:18:07.240 --> 04:18:08.920]   - If you read the language of the resolution,
[04:18:08.920 --> 04:18:10.400]   binding is typically if it commits you
[04:18:10.400 --> 04:18:11.960]   to upholding a particular international law
[04:18:11.960 --> 04:18:12.800]   or if it establishes a new rule.
[04:18:12.800 --> 04:18:13.640]   - What is chapter six?
[04:18:13.640 --> 04:18:18.160]   You just throw out words, you hear binding, not binding.
[04:18:18.160 --> 04:18:20.720]   - Does 242 mention a Palestinian state norm?
[04:18:20.720 --> 04:18:21.560]   - Of course not.
[04:18:21.560 --> 04:18:22.380]   - That's part of the problem.
[04:18:22.380 --> 04:18:24.440]   - That was the reason why the Palestinians
[04:18:24.440 --> 04:18:26.520]   didn't want to recognize 242,
[04:18:26.520 --> 04:18:28.360]   'cause they're only referred at the very end
[04:18:28.360 --> 04:18:29.200]   for refugee problems.
[04:18:29.200 --> 04:18:30.920]   - But the PLO recognized 181 and 242.
[04:18:30.920 --> 04:18:32.240]   - Yeah, but hold on, hold on.
[04:18:32.240 --> 04:18:35.480]   Every United Nations Security Council resolution,
[04:18:35.480 --> 04:18:38.760]   irrespective of under which chapter it was adopted,
[04:18:38.760 --> 04:18:41.640]   is by definition binding.
[04:18:41.640 --> 04:18:44.920]   Binding not only on the members of the Security Council,
[04:18:44.920 --> 04:18:47.780]   but on every member state of the UN.
[04:18:47.780 --> 04:18:51.120]   That's, read the UN charter, it's black and white.
[04:18:51.120 --> 04:18:52.280]   - Sure, people can look that up if they want.
[04:18:52.280 --> 04:18:53.120]   - Now regarding, yes.
[04:18:53.120 --> 04:18:56.280]   - But the language even of 242 is kept intentionally vague
[04:18:56.280 --> 04:18:58.360]   such that it doesn't actually provide, again,
[04:18:58.360 --> 04:18:59.200]   the final concord. - It's actually
[04:18:59.200 --> 04:19:00.020]   not that vague. - It's incredibly vague.
[04:19:00.020 --> 04:19:05.020]   - Because the term land for peace originates in 242.
[04:19:05.020 --> 04:19:05.960]   The idea is-- - Sure, but what about
[04:19:05.960 --> 04:19:07.480]   territorial acquisition and Israel's need
[04:19:07.480 --> 04:19:09.240]   to give it up was kept vague.
[04:19:09.240 --> 04:19:12.240]   That's why in '79, Israel saw that they fulfilled
[04:19:12.240 --> 04:19:15.520]   their obligations under 242 in terms of withdrawal.
[04:19:15.520 --> 04:19:17.920]   - Allow me points of information.
[04:19:17.920 --> 04:19:21.400]   The first principle in UN resolution 242
[04:19:21.400 --> 04:19:23.960]   is that the inadmissibility of the acquisition
[04:19:23.960 --> 04:19:25.400]   of territory by force.
[04:19:25.400 --> 04:19:26.960]   - Which is meaningless.
[04:19:26.960 --> 04:19:29.320]   - It may be meaningless to you, Mr. Bunnell.
[04:19:29.320 --> 04:19:30.880]   - It was meaningless to everyone in the region.
[04:19:30.880 --> 04:19:35.880]   - Mr. Bunnell, that principle was adopted
[04:19:36.140 --> 04:19:38.280]   by the Friendly Nations Resolution,
[04:19:38.280 --> 04:19:41.640]   the UN General Assembly in 1970.
[04:19:41.640 --> 04:19:44.880]   That resolution was then reiterated
[04:19:44.880 --> 04:19:48.240]   in the International Court of Justice
[04:19:48.240 --> 04:19:53.080]   this ruling advisory opinion in 2004.
[04:19:53.080 --> 04:19:57.400]   That was the basis of the coalition
[04:19:57.400 --> 04:20:00.760]   against Iraq when it acquired Kuwait
[04:20:00.760 --> 04:20:03.480]   and then declared it a province of Kuwait.
[04:20:03.480 --> 04:20:04.880]   - Yeah, which Eric Patton supported.
[04:20:04.880 --> 04:20:06.040]   - That's what's called,
[04:20:06.040 --> 04:20:06.880]   that's what's called under--
[04:20:06.880 --> 04:20:07.700]   - That's true, Eric Patton.
[04:20:07.700 --> 04:20:08.540]   - Eric Patton did support it.
[04:20:08.540 --> 04:20:09.380]   - Eric Patton did support it.
[04:20:09.380 --> 04:20:11.160]   - It's a shady deal with the Oslo Accords.
[04:20:11.160 --> 04:20:12.340]   - I'm not gonna go there.
[04:20:12.340 --> 04:20:13.180]   I'm not gonna go there.
[04:20:13.180 --> 04:20:15.120]   - It's not accurate that Eric Patton endorsed.
[04:20:15.120 --> 04:20:16.480]   - Okay, I'm not gonna go there.
[04:20:16.480 --> 04:20:17.680]   - Okay.
[04:20:17.680 --> 04:20:19.780]   - It's called under international law,
[04:20:19.780 --> 04:20:24.620]   use Kogans or peremptory norms of international law,
[04:20:24.620 --> 04:20:26.760]   the inadmissibility of the acquisition
[04:20:26.760 --> 04:20:28.200]   of territory by war.
[04:20:28.200 --> 04:20:30.120]   That is not controversial.
[04:20:30.120 --> 04:20:31.800]   It's not vague.
[04:20:31.800 --> 04:20:34.840]   You couldn't put it more succinctly.
[04:20:34.840 --> 04:20:38.200]   You cannot acquire territory by force
[04:20:38.200 --> 04:20:39.420]   under international law.
[04:20:39.420 --> 04:20:41.160]   - Who owned the White Bank before '67?
[04:20:41.160 --> 04:20:43.560]   Who owned the Gaza Strip before '67?
[04:20:43.560 --> 04:20:47.780]   - Mr. Bonnell, don't change the subject.
[04:20:47.780 --> 04:20:49.600]   If you don't know what you're talking about,
[04:20:49.600 --> 04:20:52.680]   at least have the, at least have the humility.
[04:20:52.680 --> 04:20:54.520]   You talk about chapter six.
[04:20:54.520 --> 04:20:55.660]   You don't know chapter six.
[04:20:55.660 --> 04:20:59.760]   You don't know chapter six from tweet five.
[04:20:59.760 --> 04:21:02.160]   You have no idea what you're talking about.
[04:21:02.160 --> 04:21:04.040]   It's just so embarrassing.
[04:21:04.040 --> 04:21:06.560]   At least have some humility.
[04:21:06.560 --> 04:21:10.320]   Between us, we've read maybe 10,000 books on the topic,
[04:21:10.320 --> 04:21:13.800]   and you've read two Wikipedia entries,
[04:21:13.800 --> 04:21:16.160]   and you start talking about chapter six.
[04:21:16.160 --> 04:21:17.680]   Do you know what chapter seven is?
[04:21:17.680 --> 04:21:18.520]   - Answer me, answer me a question.
[04:21:18.520 --> 04:21:19.340]   - Do you know what chapter seven is?
[04:21:19.340 --> 04:21:20.180]   - No, answer me a question.
[04:21:20.180 --> 04:21:22.680]   How close has 242 gotten the Palestinians to a state?
[04:21:22.680 --> 04:21:24.880]   How close has the 2004 advisory opinion
[04:21:24.880 --> 04:21:26.200]   gotten the West Bank settlement?
[04:21:26.200 --> 04:21:27.520]   - What's your alternative?
[04:21:27.520 --> 04:21:29.880]   - The alternative is not this,
[04:21:29.880 --> 04:21:31.880]   whatever this making money off the conflict is.
[04:21:31.880 --> 04:21:33.480]   The actual alternative.
[04:21:33.480 --> 04:21:34.320]   The actual alternative.
[04:21:34.320 --> 04:21:36.500]   - Destiny should talk about making money off of idiocy.
[04:21:36.500 --> 04:21:38.360]   - Yeah, you're a media blitz where you go and talk
[04:21:38.360 --> 04:21:40.780]   to 50 million different people about your awesome solution.
[04:21:40.780 --> 04:21:41.620]   - But he has a point there.
[04:21:41.620 --> 04:21:42.440]   - The issue is you have to negotiate.
[04:21:42.440 --> 04:21:45.200]   - All these resolutions have gotten the Palestinians
[04:21:45.200 --> 04:21:46.840]   no closer to a state.
[04:21:46.840 --> 04:21:48.640]   - Because they haven't been enforced
[04:21:48.640 --> 04:21:49.960]   because of the U.S. veto.
[04:21:49.960 --> 04:21:51.040]   - They're not gonna be enforced.
[04:21:51.040 --> 04:21:52.040]   - Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:21:52.040 --> 04:21:52.880]   - Okay.
[04:21:52.880 --> 04:21:54.080]   - If I may, if I may.
[04:21:54.080 --> 04:21:57.440]   - You know what, you know what, Professor Morris.
[04:21:57.440 --> 04:21:58.400]   - We're talking about the case for genocide.
[04:21:58.400 --> 04:22:01.840]   - Professor Morris, because of your logic
[04:22:01.840 --> 04:22:03.920]   and I'm not disputing it,
[04:22:03.920 --> 04:22:05.760]   that's why October 7th happened.
[04:22:05.760 --> 04:22:06.720]   - Oh my God.
[04:22:06.720 --> 04:22:11.720]   - Because there was no options left for those people.
[04:22:11.720 --> 04:22:12.720]   Exactly what Mouin said.
[04:22:12.720 --> 04:22:14.680]   - And now what options are left?
[04:22:14.680 --> 04:22:18.080]   After October 7th, what's the options left?
[04:22:18.080 --> 04:22:18.900]   - The only option is conflict.
[04:22:18.900 --> 04:22:19.740]   - Listen to this.
[04:22:19.740 --> 04:22:20.580]   - The only option is combat.
[04:22:20.580 --> 04:22:24.300]   - Mr. Bonnell is now an expert on Palestinian mentality.
[04:22:24.300 --> 04:22:25.140]   - You're contradicting yourself.
[04:22:25.140 --> 04:22:25.980]   - You know much about Palestinian mentality
[04:22:25.980 --> 04:22:26.800]   as you know about chapter five.
[04:22:26.800 --> 04:22:27.640]   - I only deal with the facts.
[04:22:27.640 --> 04:22:28.460]   I only deal with the facts.
[04:22:28.460 --> 04:22:29.300]   - Tell me about chapter five.
[04:22:29.300 --> 04:22:30.140]   - Egypt didn't find it necessary to.
[04:22:30.140 --> 04:22:30.960]   - Tell me about chapter five.
[04:22:30.960 --> 04:22:31.800]   - Egypt didn't find it necessary to.
[04:22:31.800 --> 04:22:32.620]   - Tell me about chapter five.
[04:22:32.620 --> 04:22:33.460]   - Negotiate peace with the Palestinians.
[04:22:33.460 --> 04:22:34.300]   - Tell me about chapter five.
[04:22:34.300 --> 04:22:35.120]   - Jordan didn't find it necessary
[04:22:35.120 --> 04:22:35.960]   to negotiate peace with the Palestinians.
[04:22:35.960 --> 04:22:36.800]   - Hey, if I may.
[04:22:36.800 --> 04:22:37.620]   - The Arabian Accords didn't work.
[04:22:37.620 --> 04:22:38.460]   - You're contradicting yourself.
[04:22:38.460 --> 04:22:39.300]   - Didn't work for the Palestinians.
[04:22:39.300 --> 04:22:40.120]   - You're contradicting yourself.
[04:22:40.120 --> 04:22:40.960]   - You're contradicting yourself.
[04:22:40.960 --> 04:22:41.800]   - Despite all of the international law.
[04:22:41.800 --> 04:22:42.620]   - Everybody, Mouin.
[04:22:42.620 --> 04:22:43.880]   - You're contradicting yourself.
[04:22:43.880 --> 04:22:47.060]   On the one hand, you're saying all the Palestinians do
[04:22:47.060 --> 04:22:50.240]   is fight and violence and terrorism and all the rest of it.
[04:22:50.240 --> 04:22:52.160]   But on the other hand, you're saying
[04:22:52.160 --> 04:22:57.160]   they're expecting salvation from UN resolutions
[04:22:57.160 --> 04:22:58.580]   and international coordination.
[04:22:58.580 --> 04:22:59.960]   Those aren't violent.
[04:22:59.960 --> 04:23:00.800]   - It's the law.
[04:23:00.800 --> 04:23:01.620]   - No, but it's part of maintaining.
[04:23:01.620 --> 04:23:04.440]   - It's the continual putting off of negotiating.
[04:23:04.440 --> 04:23:05.280]   - They've negotiated.
[04:23:05.280 --> 04:23:06.100]   - Any solution.
[04:23:06.100 --> 04:23:06.940]   - They've negotiated.
[04:23:06.940 --> 04:23:09.420]   - As in when Arafat takes 10 days to respond.
[04:23:09.420 --> 04:23:10.760]   When Arafat takes 10 days to respond,
[04:23:10.760 --> 04:23:12.280]   the President said all over the world
[04:23:12.280 --> 04:23:13.120]   they're going to visit their friends.
[04:23:13.120 --> 04:23:13.960]   Yes, that's what putting the conflict off is definitely.
[04:23:13.960 --> 04:23:18.520]   - But Mouin said they accepted two states in 1975.
[04:23:18.520 --> 04:23:19.360]   Brace yourself.
[04:23:19.360 --> 04:23:20.200]   - Why didn't they accept the Congress then?
[04:23:20.200 --> 04:23:21.020]   - Brace yourself.
[04:23:21.020 --> 04:23:22.500]   - That's 50 years ago.
[04:23:22.500 --> 04:23:23.320]   - This is a legend.
[04:23:23.320 --> 04:23:24.160]   - That's a half century ago.
[04:23:24.160 --> 04:23:26.480]   - No, no, they didn't accept the two-state solution.
[04:23:26.480 --> 04:23:28.480]   - He quoted a very good article.
[04:23:28.480 --> 04:23:30.840]   - You can quote Arafat talking about how he's lying
[04:23:30.840 --> 04:23:32.960]   and he's just going to use a 94 and a 95
[04:23:32.960 --> 04:23:33.800]   when he's making trips around the world.
[04:23:33.800 --> 04:23:34.620]   - But there's a very rich-
[04:23:34.620 --> 04:23:37.080]   - He just wanted to use this as the starting ground.
[04:23:37.080 --> 04:23:37.920]   I'm sorry, I get hooked.
[04:23:37.920 --> 04:23:39.920]   So you can watch the DVD and slow it down to 0.5 speed
[04:23:39.920 --> 04:23:40.960]   if you don't understand what I'm saying.
[04:23:40.960 --> 04:23:41.800]   - Let me finish.
[04:23:41.800 --> 04:23:44.720]   There's a very lengthy history
[04:23:44.720 --> 04:23:46.920]   of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
[04:23:46.920 --> 04:23:49.880]   You want to deny that those negotiations took place.
[04:23:49.880 --> 04:23:52.720]   - Where it feels like there was a good faith effort.
[04:23:52.720 --> 04:23:54.960]   Where there was a good faith effort.
[04:23:54.960 --> 04:23:56.440]   Where it was a good faith effort.
[04:23:56.440 --> 04:23:57.260]   - We have a written record.
[04:23:57.260 --> 04:23:58.100]   - With all due respect.
[04:23:58.100 --> 04:23:58.920]   - We have a written record.
[04:23:58.920 --> 04:23:59.760]   - Mr. Pop Historian,
[04:23:59.760 --> 04:24:00.920]   I can't even read the written records.
[04:24:00.920 --> 04:24:01.760]   I don't know why you're referring to it.
[04:24:01.760 --> 04:24:02.600]   - Excuse me?
[04:24:02.600 --> 04:24:06.340]   I just said there are 15,000 pages on Annapolis.
[04:24:06.340 --> 04:24:08.120]   - And I'm sure you cherry-quicked your favorite quote
[04:24:08.120 --> 04:24:08.960]   from all of them.
[04:24:08.960 --> 04:24:09.800]   - I know, cherry-picked.
[04:24:09.800 --> 04:24:10.620]   - Okay, that's great.
[04:24:10.620 --> 04:24:11.460]   That's great.
[04:24:11.460 --> 04:24:13.440]   - Hey, at least I had a quote to cherry-pick.
[04:24:13.440 --> 04:24:14.280]   - That's great.
[04:24:14.280 --> 04:24:15.960]   - All you have is Wikipedia.
[04:24:15.960 --> 04:24:16.960]   - I gave you quotes.
[04:24:16.960 --> 04:24:17.800]   - All you have is Wikipedia.
[04:24:17.800 --> 04:24:19.280]   - Do you want quotes?
[04:24:19.280 --> 04:24:20.120]   Find me the information.
[04:24:20.120 --> 04:24:22.240]   It says the Palestinian cause has been furthered
[04:24:22.240 --> 04:24:23.080]   by any international law.
[04:24:23.080 --> 04:24:24.120]   You can't do it.
[04:24:24.120 --> 04:24:27.080]   - I think the problem is different, okay?
[04:24:27.080 --> 04:24:31.520]   You want to say the Palestinians were only fighting,
[04:24:31.520 --> 04:24:34.920]   and then when I point out they've also gone to the court
[04:24:34.920 --> 04:24:37.720]   and the UN to say, well, all they do then is these things,
[04:24:37.720 --> 04:24:39.420]   and they should be negotiating,
[04:24:39.420 --> 04:24:43.580]   and I demonstrate that there was a lengthy record
[04:24:43.580 --> 04:24:44.760]   of negotiations that said, yeah,
[04:24:44.760 --> 04:24:46.520]   but they didn't go in good faith.
[04:24:46.520 --> 04:24:49.520]   Again, you're placing the hamster in the wheel
[04:24:49.520 --> 04:24:51.240]   and telling him if he runs fast enough,
[04:24:51.240 --> 04:24:53.000]   maybe one day he'll get out of the cage.
[04:24:53.000 --> 04:24:54.720]   - What was the best good faith negotiations
[04:24:54.720 --> 04:24:55.560]   on the side of the-- - And please,
[04:24:55.560 --> 04:24:56.640]   if I could just finish.
[04:24:56.640 --> 04:24:59.360]   I think the fundamental problem here
[04:24:59.360 --> 04:25:01.960]   is not what the Palestinians have and haven't done,
[04:25:01.960 --> 04:25:05.360]   and it's perfectly legitimate to have a discussion
[04:25:05.360 --> 04:25:08.760]   about whether they could have been more effective.
[04:25:08.760 --> 04:25:10.160]   Of course they could have been more effective.
[04:25:10.160 --> 04:25:12.720]   Everyone could have always been more effective.
[04:25:12.720 --> 04:25:17.160]   The fundamental issue here is that Israel
[04:25:17.160 --> 04:25:22.160]   has never been prepared to concede the legitimacy
[04:25:22.160 --> 04:25:25.240]   of Palestinian national rights
[04:25:25.240 --> 04:25:29.200]   in the land of the former British mandate of Palestine.
[04:25:29.200 --> 04:25:30.720]   - How do you explain Taba Summit?
[04:25:30.720 --> 04:25:32.040]   How do you explain the Camp David?
[04:25:32.040 --> 04:25:33.640]   - No, Barak and Olmert did--
[04:25:33.640 --> 04:25:34.480]   - How do you explain Olbert's offer to the Ba'aths?
[04:25:34.480 --> 04:25:37.020]   - Did accept the legitimacy of Palestinian demands.
[04:25:37.020 --> 04:25:37.860]   This is--
[04:25:37.860 --> 04:25:39.560]   - Well, those-- - But they just didn't want
[04:25:39.560 --> 04:25:42.660]   to give the Palestinians all of Palestine, that's all.
[04:25:42.660 --> 04:25:43.920]   - No, all of Palestine?
[04:25:43.920 --> 04:25:44.760]   - All of Palestine.
[04:25:44.760 --> 04:25:45.960]   - You mean all of the occupied territories?
[04:25:45.960 --> 04:25:46.780]   - No, no, no.
[04:25:46.780 --> 04:25:47.620]   You're talking about all of Palestine
[04:25:47.620 --> 04:25:48.920]   and the occupied territories. - Wait, what is the occupied?
[04:25:48.920 --> 04:25:50.360]   What is the occupied territories?
[04:25:50.360 --> 04:25:52.040]   - The occupied territories. - Is that all of Israel?
[04:25:52.040 --> 04:25:55.200]   - The occupied territories are those territories
[04:25:55.200 --> 04:25:59.200]   that Israel occupied in June of 1967.
[04:25:59.200 --> 04:26:01.200]   - The Palestinians often use that term
[04:26:01.200 --> 04:26:03.960]   to define the whole of Palestine, not just the West Bank.
[04:26:03.960 --> 04:26:06.560]   - Could you show me, Professor Morris,
[04:26:06.560 --> 04:26:10.800]   in all the negotiations, all the negotiations,
[04:26:10.800 --> 04:26:13.320]   and all the accounts that have been written,
[04:26:13.320 --> 04:26:17.440]   can you show me one where the Palestinians
[04:26:17.440 --> 04:26:19.600]   in the negotiations, 'cause that's what we were talking
[04:26:19.600 --> 04:26:22.720]   about, wanted all of Israel.
[04:26:22.720 --> 04:26:24.560]   The maximum-- - They can't say that
[04:26:24.560 --> 04:26:26.680]   'cause international community won't accept it.
[04:26:26.680 --> 04:26:27.520]   - You know it 'cause you know what--
[04:26:27.520 --> 04:26:29.000]   - So they didn't say it, they didn't ask for it.
[04:26:29.000 --> 04:26:29.840]   - But you know what lurks in their heart.
[04:26:29.840 --> 04:26:31.160]   - No, Hamas did.
[04:26:31.160 --> 04:26:32.840]   Hamas always said all of it.
[04:26:32.840 --> 04:26:34.520]   - Hamas only negotiated with Israel
[04:26:34.520 --> 04:26:35.920]   about prisoner exchanges and the blockade.
[04:26:35.920 --> 04:26:38.280]   - Yeah, no, I know, but they represent a lot
[04:26:38.280 --> 04:26:40.080]   of the Palestinian people, you'll agree.
[04:26:40.080 --> 04:26:45.080]   - The only place I saw pieces of Israel were the land swaps,
[04:26:45.080 --> 04:26:49.580]   and the land swaps accounted for about 2% to 5% of Israel.
[04:26:49.580 --> 04:26:51.760]   - Nobody asked for all of Israel.
[04:26:51.760 --> 04:26:52.600]   Why do you say things like that?
[04:26:52.600 --> 04:26:54.480]   - What do you mean, they asked for all of Israel in '48,
[04:26:54.480 --> 04:26:56.160]   they asked for all of Israel in '67.
[04:26:56.160 --> 04:26:57.640]   What do you think those wars were about?
[04:26:57.640 --> 04:26:59.480]   You're not gonna respond to anything I'm saying
[04:26:59.480 --> 04:27:00.320]   'cause you have no answer.
[04:27:00.320 --> 04:27:01.140]   - I'll respond to you.
[04:27:01.140 --> 04:27:01.980]   - That's correct.
[04:27:01.980 --> 04:27:04.640]   - Okay, Mr. Ben-El, we were talking about
[04:27:04.640 --> 04:27:09.640]   the diplomatic negotiations beginning with 2000, 2001.
[04:27:09.640 --> 04:27:13.000]   - You can't pretend that the first ask for Israel
[04:27:13.000 --> 04:27:14.320]   was in diplomacy.
[04:27:14.320 --> 04:27:15.160]   It was through war.
[04:27:15.160 --> 04:27:16.560]   - You don't know what you're talking about.
[04:27:16.560 --> 04:27:18.960]   - Is the international law argument ever going
[04:27:18.960 --> 04:27:20.200]   to get the Palestinians closer to state?
[04:27:20.200 --> 04:27:22.560]   Is the Israeli state ever gonna be dismantled?
[04:27:22.560 --> 04:27:25.120]   Do you think that's realistic coming up, ever,
[04:27:25.120 --> 04:27:26.040]   in the next 20 years?
[04:27:26.040 --> 04:27:28.560]   - Again, I'm posing a question.
[04:27:28.560 --> 04:27:34.440]   And the question is, regardless of what's feasible
[04:27:34.440 --> 04:27:38.240]   or realistic today, the question I'm posing is,
[04:27:38.240 --> 04:27:40.880]   can you have peace in the Middle East
[04:27:40.880 --> 04:27:45.880]   with this militant, irrational, genocidal, apartheid state
[04:27:48.480 --> 04:27:50.640]   and power? - I don't think so, no.
[04:27:50.640 --> 04:27:53.680]   - Okay, and the question I'm asking is,
[04:27:53.680 --> 04:27:56.480]   can you have peace with this regime,
[04:27:56.480 --> 04:27:59.840]   or does this regime and its institutions
[04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:03.080]   need to be dismantled, similar to what the examples
[04:28:03.080 --> 04:28:05.440]   I gave of Europe and Southern Africa?
[04:28:05.440 --> 04:28:06.400]   - How do you contend with the fact
[04:28:06.400 --> 04:28:07.840]   that most of the surrounding Arab states
[04:28:07.840 --> 04:28:09.460]   seem to agree that you can?
[04:28:09.460 --> 04:28:11.320]   - Yeah, you're correct.
[04:28:11.320 --> 04:28:15.760]   Several of them, most importantly Egypt, Jordan,
[04:28:15.760 --> 04:28:19.360]   have made their peace with Israel.
[04:28:19.360 --> 04:28:22.880]   I should add that Israel's conduct since then
[04:28:22.880 --> 04:28:26.440]   has placed these relations under strain.
[04:28:26.440 --> 04:28:31.440]   I had very little, I didn't take the reports
[04:28:31.440 --> 04:28:35.920]   of a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement particularly seriously
[04:28:35.920 --> 04:28:38.680]   before October 7th, the reason being
[04:28:38.680 --> 04:28:42.020]   that it was really a Saudi-Israeli-U.S. deal,
[04:28:42.020 --> 04:28:45.360]   which committed the U.S. to make certain commitments
[04:28:45.360 --> 04:28:46.800]   to Saudi Arabia that would probably
[04:28:46.800 --> 04:28:48.880]   never get through Congress.
[04:28:48.880 --> 04:28:50.740]   - Do you not consider the Egypt-Israeli peace deal
[04:28:50.740 --> 04:28:53.020]   legitimate then, since the United States
[04:28:53.020 --> 04:28:54.960]   made a great financial contribution to Egypt?
[04:28:54.960 --> 04:28:56.480]   - I don't think the question is whether
[04:28:56.480 --> 04:28:59.920]   that deal is legitimate or not.
[04:28:59.920 --> 04:29:04.920]   I think that deal exists, but the point is
[04:29:04.920 --> 04:29:09.840]   whether the core of this conflict
[04:29:09.840 --> 04:29:12.720]   is not between Israel and Egypt.
[04:29:12.720 --> 04:29:16.680]   The core of this conflict is between Israel
[04:29:16.680 --> 04:29:20.080]   and the Palestinian people, and the reason
[04:29:20.080 --> 04:29:23.440]   that Israel agreed to relinquish
[04:29:23.440 --> 04:29:27.560]   the occupied Egyptian Sinai, and the reason
[04:29:27.560 --> 04:29:31.560]   that Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was signed in 1979
[04:29:31.560 --> 04:29:35.620]   is because Israel in 1973 recognized
[04:29:35.620 --> 04:29:40.100]   that its military superiority was ultimately
[04:29:40.100 --> 04:29:42.020]   no match for Egypt's determination
[04:29:42.020 --> 04:29:43.840]   to recover its occupied territories,
[04:29:43.840 --> 04:29:45.660]   and that there would come a point
[04:29:45.660 --> 04:29:47.920]   when Egypt would find a way to extract
[04:29:47.920 --> 04:29:49.200]   an unbearable price. - Maybe just
[04:29:49.200 --> 04:29:50.840]   the Israelis wanted peace.
[04:29:50.840 --> 04:29:52.480]   - Well, the Israelis wanted-- - Not just because
[04:29:52.480 --> 04:29:54.520]   they were afraid of what Egypt might do at some point.
[04:29:54.520 --> 04:29:57.200]   - If you're talking about the average Israeli citizen,
[04:29:57.200 --> 04:29:59.200]   I think that's a fair characterization.
[04:29:59.200 --> 04:30:01.280]   If you're talking about the Israeli leadership,
[04:30:01.280 --> 04:30:03.800]   I think they looked at it in more strategic terms.
[04:30:03.800 --> 04:30:07.680]   How do you remove the most powerful Arab military state
[04:30:07.680 --> 04:30:09.440]   from the equation? - Two points, simple points.
[04:30:09.440 --> 04:30:13.460]   What was the terms of that Egypt-Israel peace treaty?
[04:30:13.460 --> 04:30:16.300]   International law.
[04:30:16.300 --> 04:30:19.180]   Egypt demanded every-- - Nobody cared
[04:30:19.180 --> 04:30:21.740]   about international law. - Allow me to finish.
[04:30:21.740 --> 04:30:25.220]   Every single inch of Egyptian-- - Nobody had talked
[04:30:25.220 --> 04:30:27.240]   about international law.
[04:30:27.240 --> 04:30:30.700]   Begin and Carter and Saddam talked about the reality
[04:30:30.700 --> 04:30:33.940]   of Israel occupying territory. - Professor Morris,
[04:30:33.940 --> 04:30:37.340]   Professor Morris, I know the record.
[04:30:39.020 --> 04:30:43.060]   They demanded, as you know, 'cause you've written about it,
[04:30:43.060 --> 04:30:44.980]   they demanded every square inch.
[04:30:44.980 --> 04:30:48.620]   As you know, they demanded the oil fields be dismantled.
[04:30:48.620 --> 04:30:50.340]   - No, that's in the-- - The airfields--
[04:30:50.340 --> 04:30:52.020]   - No, not dismantled, they wanted the oil fields.
[04:30:52.020 --> 04:30:53.980]   - And they wanted the settlements dismantled.
[04:30:53.980 --> 04:30:55.380]   - They wanted the settlements dismantled.
[04:30:55.380 --> 04:30:58.220]   - The settlements, the oil fields, and the airfield.
[04:30:58.220 --> 04:31:00.240]   They demanded all three back.
[04:31:00.240 --> 04:31:01.860]   You can't have-- - What do you mean back?
[04:31:01.860 --> 04:31:03.820]   The airfields weren't there when the Egyptians were there.
[04:31:03.820 --> 04:31:05.420]   - Okay, that's incorrect.
[04:31:05.420 --> 04:31:06.900]   - What's incorrect? - You're incorrect.
[04:31:06.900 --> 04:31:07.740]   They built an airfield. - The airfields
[04:31:07.740 --> 04:31:10.540]   - The airfield, the Israelis built an airfield
[04:31:10.540 --> 04:31:12.540]   in the occupied Sinai. - Yes.
[04:31:12.540 --> 04:31:14.500]   - And they wanted it back-- - They didn't want it back.
[04:31:14.500 --> 04:31:16.100]   It wasn't theirs. - No, okay.
[04:31:16.100 --> 04:31:17.980]   - They wanted the territory in which the airfield--
[04:31:17.980 --> 04:31:19.700]   - Okay, allow, okay. - Israel had built back.
[04:31:19.700 --> 04:31:21.780]   - The oil fields, the airfields,
[04:31:21.780 --> 04:31:23.700]   the settlements had to be dismantled.
[04:31:23.700 --> 04:31:24.900]   - Yes. - Begin said,
[04:31:24.900 --> 04:31:27.060]   "I don't wanna be the first prime minister
[04:31:27.060 --> 04:31:29.140]   "to dismantle a settlement." - Then he did.
[04:31:29.140 --> 04:31:30.420]   - But he did, why?
[04:31:30.420 --> 04:31:31.780]   Because of the law. - No.
[04:31:31.780 --> 04:31:33.260]   - No, it was because of peace.
[04:31:33.260 --> 04:31:34.080]   It was normalization-- - Nobody cared
[04:31:34.080 --> 04:31:34.920]   about the law.
[04:31:34.920 --> 04:31:37.060]   The law had nothing to do with anything.
[04:31:37.060 --> 04:31:38.700]   - Was there a negotiation-- - Mr. Morris, Mr. Martin--
[04:31:38.700 --> 04:31:39.700]   - Between two states-- - Mr. Martin, Mr. Morris.
[04:31:39.700 --> 04:31:41.220]   - Each of which wanted certain things.
[04:31:41.220 --> 04:31:42.980]   - Palestinians wanted-- - The law had nothing
[04:31:42.980 --> 04:31:44.380]   to do with anything. - As I said repeatedly
[04:31:44.380 --> 04:31:45.580]   in the negotiations-- - You're not listening.
[04:31:45.580 --> 04:31:46.820]   You're not listening. - I know--
[04:31:46.820 --> 04:31:48.780]   - You're missing one point. - I've read the negotiations.
[04:31:48.780 --> 04:31:49.620]   - The law has nothing to do with anything.
[04:31:49.620 --> 04:31:53.140]   - There are two foreign relations of U.S. volumes on it.
[04:31:53.140 --> 04:31:54.740]   - Nobody cared about the law.
[04:31:54.740 --> 04:31:57.140]   - The Palestinians kept saying, "We want exactly--"
[04:31:57.140 --> 04:31:58.700]   - Forget the Palestinians, they weren't there.
[04:31:58.700 --> 04:32:00.500]   - Allow me to finish.
[04:32:00.500 --> 04:32:04.140]   The Palestinians kept saying, "We want what Egypt got.
[04:32:04.140 --> 04:32:05.980]   "We want what Egypt got."
[04:32:05.980 --> 04:32:06.940]   - Yeah. - Egypt got
[04:32:06.940 --> 04:32:08.140]   everything back. - But nothing to do
[04:32:08.140 --> 04:32:09.300]   with the law. - Okay.
[04:32:09.300 --> 04:32:11.540]   - Nothing to do with the law. - And number two,
[04:32:11.540 --> 04:32:14.140]   I'm not saying it's the whole picture,
[04:32:14.140 --> 04:32:18.740]   but as Foreign Minister Moisha Dayan said at the time,
[04:32:18.740 --> 04:32:23.580]   he said, "If a car has four wheels
[04:32:23.580 --> 04:32:28.580]   "and you remove one wheel, the car can't move."
[04:32:28.580 --> 04:32:33.980]   And for them, removing Egypt from the Arab front
[04:32:34.620 --> 04:32:38.380]   would then remove any Arab military threat to Israel.
[04:32:38.380 --> 04:32:42.580]   So Muin was, no, the first part did,
[04:32:42.580 --> 04:32:45.140]   and that's what the Palestinians kept saying,
[04:32:45.140 --> 04:32:47.980]   "We want what Egypt got from the settlement."
[04:32:47.980 --> 04:32:48.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true,
[04:32:48.820 --> 04:32:50.380]   but forget international law.
[04:32:50.380 --> 04:32:51.220]   - And by the way-- - Have nothing to do
[04:32:51.220 --> 04:32:52.500]   with the negotiations. - One last thing,
[04:32:52.500 --> 04:32:54.700]   one last, on a personal note.
[04:32:54.700 --> 04:32:59.460]   The quote about Sharm el-Sheikh without peace, okay.
[04:32:59.460 --> 04:33:03.860]   That's the only thing you ever cited from a book of mine.
[04:33:03.860 --> 04:33:06.380]   - I cited it from your book? - Yes.
[04:33:06.380 --> 04:33:10.860]   I was absolutely shocked at your betrayal of your people.
[04:33:10.860 --> 04:33:13.940]   That was pure treason.
[04:33:13.940 --> 04:33:15.860]   It was one-- - I apologize for that.
[04:33:15.860 --> 04:33:18.580]   I apologize, I apologize. - Okay, I accept, I accept.
[04:33:18.580 --> 04:33:20.980]   All right, well, let me try once again.
[04:33:20.980 --> 04:33:25.340]   For the region and for just entirety of humanity,
[04:33:25.340 --> 04:33:26.540]   what gives you hope?
[04:33:26.540 --> 04:33:29.140]   We just heard a lot of pessimistic, cynical things.
[04:33:29.140 --> 04:33:30.540]   What gives you hope? - People don't like war.
[04:33:30.540 --> 04:33:32.700]   That's a good reason, that's hope.
[04:33:32.700 --> 04:33:36.700]   In other words, the fear of war, the disaster of war
[04:33:36.700 --> 04:33:41.380]   should give people an impetus to try and seek peace.
[04:33:41.380 --> 04:33:43.380]   - When you look at people in Gaza
[04:33:43.380 --> 04:33:45.380]   and people in the West Bank, people in Israel--
[04:33:45.380 --> 04:33:46.740]   - They should want-- - Fundamentally,
[04:33:46.740 --> 04:33:49.700]   no, but fundamentally, they hate war.
[04:33:49.700 --> 04:33:51.580]   - Yes, I think so.
[04:33:51.580 --> 04:33:54.220]   - What gives you hope? - There is no hope, no.
[04:33:54.220 --> 04:33:58.660]   It's an extreme, no, I'm, hey, I'm not happy to say that.
[04:33:58.660 --> 04:34:00.260]   - Of course you are. - It's a...
[04:34:02.500 --> 04:34:06.100]   It's a very bleak moment right now because--
[04:34:06.100 --> 04:34:07.300]   - That I agree with, I agree with that.
[04:34:07.300 --> 04:34:10.460]   - Israel believes it has to restore
[04:34:10.460 --> 04:34:15.060]   what it calls its deterrence capability.
[04:34:15.060 --> 04:34:16.580]   I think you've written about it, actually,
[04:34:16.580 --> 04:34:18.220]   I just realized.
[04:34:18.220 --> 04:34:21.980]   Israel has to restore its deterrence capability,
[04:34:21.980 --> 04:34:25.500]   and after the catastrophe of October 7th,
[04:34:25.500 --> 04:34:29.020]   restoring its deterrence capacity means this part
[04:34:29.020 --> 04:34:31.780]   you didn't write about, the annihilation of Gaza
[04:34:31.780 --> 04:34:33.620]   and then moving on to the Hezbollah.
[04:34:33.620 --> 04:34:37.100]   - No, no, there's-- - So, the Israelis
[04:34:37.100 --> 04:34:42.100]   are dead set on restoring that deterrence capability.
[04:34:42.100 --> 04:34:44.860]   On the Arab side, and I know Muin and I
[04:34:44.860 --> 04:34:47.500]   have disagreed on it, and we're allowed to disagree,
[04:34:47.500 --> 04:34:51.900]   I think the Arab side, the lesson they learned
[04:34:51.900 --> 04:34:55.220]   from October 7th is Israelis aren't as strong
[04:34:55.220 --> 04:34:56.420]   as we thought they were.
[04:34:56.420 --> 04:34:58.380]   And-- - That would be
[04:34:58.380 --> 04:35:01.500]   an unfortunate message, 'cause that's really
[04:35:01.500 --> 04:35:02.660]   what the Arabs come to believe.
[04:35:02.660 --> 04:35:05.860]   - And they think that there is a military option now.
[04:35:05.860 --> 04:35:10.340]   And I think that's, it's a zero-sum game at this point,
[04:35:10.340 --> 04:35:12.500]   and it's very, very bleak.
[04:35:12.500 --> 04:35:14.180]   And I'm not going to lie about that.
[04:35:14.180 --> 04:35:19.180]   Now, I will admit my predictive capacities
[04:35:19.180 --> 04:35:20.340]   are not perfect-- - Are limited.
[04:35:20.340 --> 04:35:21.500]   - Are limited. - Yes, yes.
[04:35:21.500 --> 04:35:25.300]   - But for the moment, it's a very bleak situation.
[04:35:25.300 --> 04:35:26.140]   - That I agree with.
[04:35:26.140 --> 04:35:29.420]   - And I don't see right now a way out.
[04:35:29.420 --> 04:35:34.420]   However, at the very minimum, permanent ceasefire
[04:35:34.420 --> 04:35:37.380]   and the inhuman and illegal blockade of Gaza,
[04:35:37.380 --> 04:35:39.740]   and-- - Why is it illegal?
[04:35:39.740 --> 04:35:43.180]   They were shooting rockets at Israel for 20 years.
[04:35:43.180 --> 04:35:45.780]   Why is that illegal, to blockade Gaza?
[04:35:45.780 --> 04:35:47.860]   - He thinks they're bottle rockets.
[04:35:47.860 --> 04:35:49.020]   - Why is it illegal?
[04:35:49.020 --> 04:35:49.860]   I'll tell you why.
[04:35:49.860 --> 04:35:50.980]   - You don't rocket your neighbor.
[04:35:50.980 --> 04:35:53.340]   You rocket your neighbor, expect consequences.
[04:35:53.340 --> 04:35:54.180]   - I'll tell you why.
[04:35:54.180 --> 04:35:55.620]   - Expect consequences.
[04:35:55.620 --> 04:35:56.940]   - But that works both ways.
[04:35:56.940 --> 04:35:57.780]   - I know, I know, I've said that.
[04:35:57.780 --> 04:36:00.060]   Professor Morris. - It works both ways.
[04:36:00.060 --> 04:36:01.860]   - I'll tell you why.
[04:36:01.860 --> 04:36:05.340]   Because every human rights, humanitarian,
[04:36:05.340 --> 04:36:06.980]   and UN organization in the world--
[04:36:06.980 --> 04:36:07.820]   - They're all irrelevant.
[04:36:07.820 --> 04:36:10.660]   - Has said that the blockade--
[04:36:10.660 --> 04:36:12.260]   - Nobody cares about amnesty.
[04:36:12.260 --> 04:36:13.900]   - Is a form of collective punishment--
[04:36:13.900 --> 04:36:14.740]   - Nobody cares about amnesty.
[04:36:14.740 --> 04:36:16.620]   - Which is illegal under international law.
[04:36:16.620 --> 04:36:17.460]   - Forget the legal.
[04:36:17.460 --> 04:36:19.740]   The word illegal is-- - You think a blockade--
[04:36:19.740 --> 04:36:21.340]   - You don't understand the way the world works.
[04:36:21.340 --> 04:36:26.340]   - Yeah, and you think confining,
[04:36:26.500 --> 04:36:27.860]   because that's the blockade.
[04:36:27.860 --> 04:36:28.700]   - Yes, you don't--
[04:36:28.700 --> 04:36:32.460]   - Confining a million children, confining--
[04:36:32.460 --> 04:36:33.980]   - That's the choice of Hamas.
[04:36:33.980 --> 04:36:36.740]   - Confining a million children
[04:36:36.740 --> 04:36:40.980]   in what the Economist called a human rubbish sheep.
[04:36:40.980 --> 04:36:43.180]   - The Economist supported Israel in this war
[04:36:43.180 --> 04:36:45.900]   and continues to support Israel.
[04:36:45.900 --> 04:36:47.660]   - International Committee of the Red Cross
[04:36:47.660 --> 04:36:50.260]   called a sinking ship,
[04:36:50.260 --> 04:36:52.580]   what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
[04:36:52.580 --> 04:36:55.060]   called a toxic slum.
[04:36:55.060 --> 04:36:55.900]   You think--
[04:36:55.900 --> 04:36:56.740]   - It's a toxic slum, of course it's a slum.
[04:36:56.740 --> 04:36:59.780]   - You think under international law,
[04:36:59.780 --> 04:37:01.620]   you think it's legitimate to--
[04:37:01.620 --> 04:37:02.540]   - Forget the law.
[04:37:02.540 --> 04:37:04.980]   - Hey, I know you wanna forget the law.
[04:37:04.980 --> 04:37:05.820]   - What about morality?
[04:37:05.820 --> 04:37:06.660]   - It's the one thing that every--
[04:37:06.660 --> 04:37:07.500]   - Forget the law, what about morality?
[04:37:07.500 --> 04:37:10.500]   - It's what every Israeli fears the most.
[04:37:10.500 --> 04:37:11.340]   - What?
[04:37:11.340 --> 04:37:12.340]   - The law.
[04:37:12.340 --> 04:37:13.180]   - No, no, no.
[04:37:13.180 --> 04:37:17.300]   - As Tzipi Litany said, I studied international law,
[04:37:17.300 --> 04:37:19.820]   I oppose international law.
[04:37:19.820 --> 04:37:21.700]   Of course you don't wanna hear about the law.
[04:37:21.700 --> 04:37:23.100]   - That has got nothing to do with anything.
[04:37:23.100 --> 04:37:25.340]   - Okay, so here's the thing.
[04:37:25.340 --> 04:37:28.620]   Then don't complain about October 7th.
[04:37:28.620 --> 04:37:29.460]   If you don't wanna--
[04:37:29.460 --> 04:37:30.300]   - Did you hear me complain?
[04:37:30.300 --> 04:37:32.340]   - If you wanna say, forget about the law.
[04:37:32.340 --> 04:37:33.180]   - All I said was they acted like barbarians.
[04:37:33.180 --> 04:37:37.500]   - Then there is no international humanitarian law,
[04:37:37.500 --> 04:37:41.260]   there's no distinction between civilians and combatants.
[04:37:41.260 --> 04:37:42.100]   - There should be.
[04:37:42.100 --> 04:37:42.940]   - And so Hamas--
[04:37:42.940 --> 04:37:43.780]   - There should be, but it's got nothing to do with the law.
[04:37:43.780 --> 04:37:45.580]   - Now you're doing what Muin said,
[04:37:45.580 --> 04:37:47.860]   you're becoming very selective about the law.
[04:37:47.860 --> 04:37:50.980]   If you wanna forget about the law,
[04:37:50.980 --> 04:37:53.420]   Hamas had every right to do what it did.
[04:37:53.420 --> 04:37:55.140]   It had every right to do what it did.
[04:37:55.140 --> 04:37:57.580]   According to you, not to me,
[04:37:57.580 --> 04:37:59.700]   'cause you want to forget the law.
[04:37:59.700 --> 04:38:00.900]   - Do you still support the Houthis
[04:38:00.900 --> 04:38:01.740]   shooting random ships?
[04:38:01.740 --> 04:38:02.580]   - Absolutely.
[04:38:02.580 --> 04:38:04.180]   - Okay, that's a violation of international law,
[04:38:04.180 --> 04:38:05.500]   so you play the same game.
[04:38:05.500 --> 04:38:10.380]   - Absolutely, and were there a power during World War II
[04:38:10.380 --> 04:38:13.140]   who had the courage of the Houthis,
[04:38:13.140 --> 04:38:16.060]   were there a power that had that kind of courage?
[04:38:16.060 --> 04:38:18.380]   - So courageous to be bombing merchant ships
[04:38:18.380 --> 04:38:20.820]   while tens of thousands of people die of actual starvation.
[04:38:20.820 --> 04:38:22.860]   Not the starvation that exists in the Gaza Strip
[04:38:22.860 --> 04:38:25.660]   where people, before October, don't die of starvation.
[04:38:25.660 --> 04:38:27.500]   Not the concentration camp that exists in the Gaza Strip.
[04:38:27.500 --> 04:38:29.900]   - What about starvation in Yemen?
[04:38:29.900 --> 04:38:30.740]   Don't they have something better to do?
[04:38:30.740 --> 04:38:32.180]   - Hey, that was the Houthis.
[04:38:32.180 --> 04:38:34.180]   - Yes, I know, don't they have anything better to do?
[04:38:34.180 --> 04:38:35.460]   - And you know, in three years,
[04:38:35.460 --> 04:38:37.100]   they lost 180,000 people.
[04:38:37.100 --> 04:38:38.500]   - Shouldn't they be feeding the Yemenis?
[04:38:38.500 --> 04:38:42.260]   - You know, 60,000 Yemenis died in starvation.
[04:38:42.260 --> 04:38:44.500]   - Why fight the Western powers in Israel
[04:38:44.500 --> 04:38:46.980]   when you should be taking care of your problems at home,
[04:38:46.980 --> 04:38:47.820]   the Houthis?
[04:38:47.820 --> 04:38:50.780]   - Often, the only allies of the dispossessed
[04:38:50.780 --> 04:38:53.740]   are those who experience similar circumstances.
[04:38:53.740 --> 04:38:55.660]   - Don't you think that they should take care
[04:38:55.660 --> 04:38:57.780]   of the Yemeni problems?
[04:38:57.780 --> 04:38:59.180]   - As I said- - I'm very happy.
[04:38:59.180 --> 04:39:01.980]   I'm very happy they're helping out the Palestinians.
[04:39:01.980 --> 04:39:02.820]   Anyone who helps the people-
[04:39:02.820 --> 04:39:04.500]   - It's at the expense of the Yemenis.
[04:39:04.500 --> 04:39:05.700]   - Anybody- - They don't pay for it.
[04:39:05.700 --> 04:39:07.180]   - Anybody who comes to the aid
[04:39:07.180 --> 04:39:08.940]   of those suffering the genocide,
[04:39:08.940 --> 04:39:10.140]   half of whom are- - There's no genocide.
[04:39:10.140 --> 04:39:11.660]   - Half of whom are children.
[04:39:11.660 --> 04:39:14.180]   Yeah, according to the most current UN reports,
[04:39:14.180 --> 04:39:15.780]   as of today- - There's no genocide.
[04:39:15.780 --> 04:39:18.700]   - One quarter of the population of Gaza-
[04:39:18.700 --> 04:39:19.540]   - Is starving.
[04:39:19.540 --> 04:39:22.340]   - That means 500,000 children-
[04:39:22.340 --> 04:39:23.180]   - Are starving.
[04:39:23.180 --> 04:39:25.860]   - Are on the verge of famine.
[04:39:25.860 --> 04:39:27.140]   - They keep saying on the verge of.
[04:39:27.140 --> 04:39:27.980]   - On the verge of.
[04:39:27.980 --> 04:39:28.820]   - I have not- - Didn't you call
[04:39:28.820 --> 04:39:29.660]   that they said it was unlivable?
[04:39:29.660 --> 04:39:33.140]   - I have not seen one Palestinian die of starvation
[04:39:33.140 --> 04:39:34.740]   in these last four months, not one.
[04:39:34.740 --> 04:39:35.580]   - There have been documented cases.
[04:39:35.580 --> 04:39:36.420]   - They're always on the verge.
[04:39:36.420 --> 04:39:37.260]   They're on the verge.
[04:39:37.260 --> 04:39:38.620]   - There have been documented cases.
[04:39:38.620 --> 04:39:39.460]   - I haven't seen them.
[04:39:39.460 --> 04:39:40.860]   - Yesterday, Al Jazeera said six,
[04:39:40.860 --> 04:39:42.220]   and the day before that, they said two.
[04:39:42.220 --> 04:39:43.060]   So those are the two.
[04:39:43.060 --> 04:39:45.660]   - Okay, that number probably dies
[04:39:45.660 --> 04:39:47.220]   in Israel of starvation also.
[04:39:47.220 --> 04:39:49.100]   - I don't think there's famine in Israel.
[04:39:49.100 --> 04:39:49.940]   - There isn't.
[04:39:49.940 --> 04:39:51.460]   There isn't in the Gaza Strip either.
[04:39:51.460 --> 04:39:52.300]   - You're so late.
[04:39:52.300 --> 04:39:54.580]   - It's something which is produced for the Western-
[04:39:54.580 --> 04:39:55.420]   - I haven't seen any children yet.
[04:39:55.420 --> 04:40:00.300]   - There are infants dying due to a engineered lack
[04:40:00.300 --> 04:40:01.980]   of access to food and nutrition.
[04:40:01.980 --> 04:40:03.020]   - I don't think it's engineered.
[04:40:03.020 --> 04:40:05.220]   I think if the Hamas stopped shooting, perhaps-
[04:40:05.220 --> 04:40:06.420]   - Unfortunately, unfortunately-
[04:40:06.420 --> 04:40:08.220]   - As you said, engineered.
[04:40:08.220 --> 04:40:11.100]   - I think Amnesty, excuse me,
[04:40:11.100 --> 04:40:14.420]   Human Rights Watch called it using starvation as a weapon.
[04:40:14.420 --> 04:40:15.460]   That's called engineering.
[04:40:15.460 --> 04:40:16.300]   - Okay.
[04:40:16.300 --> 04:40:17.140]   - That's what they did.
[04:40:17.140 --> 04:40:17.980]   But you were pushed on this by Coleman Hughes
[04:40:17.980 --> 04:40:20.460]   to bring up like an example of why is the Gaza Strip?
[04:40:20.460 --> 04:40:22.460]   Like by what metric are they starving?
[04:40:22.460 --> 04:40:25.340]   By what metric is it so behind the rest of the world?
[04:40:25.340 --> 04:40:27.140]   - You know, if we're gonna bring up-
[04:40:27.140 --> 04:40:27.980]   - I wanna hear an answer to that
[04:40:27.980 --> 04:40:28.820]   'cause he didn't answer it before-
[04:40:28.820 --> 04:40:29.740]   - Okay, I'm happy to answer it.
[04:40:29.740 --> 04:40:30.580]   - Yeah.
[04:40:30.580 --> 04:40:33.020]   - I just called you from the humanitarian organizations.
[04:40:33.020 --> 04:40:35.900]   They said one quarter of the population of Gaza
[04:40:35.900 --> 04:40:37.140]   is now verging on famine.
[04:40:37.140 --> 04:40:37.980]   - Before October 7th.
[04:40:37.980 --> 04:40:38.820]   - Okay.
[04:40:38.820 --> 04:40:39.640]   - Before October 7th.
[04:40:39.640 --> 04:40:40.480]   - I'm not going before October 7th.
[04:40:40.480 --> 04:40:42.060]   - You use that as justification for Hamas fighting.
[04:40:42.060 --> 04:40:43.420]   You say the conditions were unlivable.
[04:40:43.420 --> 04:40:44.260]   They had to fight.
[04:40:44.260 --> 04:40:45.080]   - Yeah, I said to him-
[04:40:45.080 --> 04:40:46.520]   - So my question is what made it unlivable
[04:40:46.520 --> 04:40:47.360]   prior to October 7th?
[04:40:47.360 --> 04:40:49.300]   What are the metrics that you're using?
[04:40:49.300 --> 04:40:53.580]   - Okay, there were about five, six or seven reports
[04:40:53.580 --> 04:40:57.620]   issued by UNCTAD, issued by the World Bank,
[04:40:57.620 --> 04:41:00.500]   issued by the International Monetary Fund,
[04:41:00.500 --> 04:41:03.140]   and they all said, "That's why."
[04:41:03.140 --> 04:41:03.980]   That's why-
[04:41:03.980 --> 04:41:04.800]   - Why did they say why?
[04:41:04.800 --> 04:41:05.640]   Why did they say that?
[04:41:05.640 --> 04:41:09.980]   - That's why the economist, not a radical periodical,
[04:41:09.980 --> 04:41:12.380]   described Gaza as a human rubbish.
[04:41:12.380 --> 04:41:14.100]   - So tell me by what metrics?
[04:41:14.100 --> 04:41:15.860]   If you're a historian-
[04:41:15.860 --> 04:41:16.680]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[04:41:16.680 --> 04:41:17.520]   - If you do all this work to get into things,
[04:41:17.520 --> 04:41:18.360]   tell me what they said-
[04:41:18.360 --> 04:41:19.180]   - Here's something, Mr. Bunnell.
[04:41:19.180 --> 04:41:20.020]   - Tell me by what metrics?
[04:41:20.020 --> 04:41:21.600]   - Mr. Bunnell.
[04:41:21.600 --> 04:41:23.180]   - He's not gonna answer again.
[04:41:23.180 --> 04:41:25.780]   - I don't think I've avoided any of your questions,
[04:41:25.780 --> 04:41:28.120]   except when they breached,
[04:41:28.120 --> 04:41:31.200]   when they breached a threshold of complete imbecility.
[04:41:31.200 --> 04:41:32.640]   - So you're about to tell me by what metric
[04:41:32.640 --> 04:41:33.480]   the Gaza Strip is a humanitarian crisis?
[04:41:33.480 --> 04:41:34.720]   - Okay, I'm going to answer this.
[04:41:34.720 --> 04:41:36.400]   You remember what I said a moment ago?
[04:41:36.400 --> 04:41:40.220]   I said to Professor Morris, "I defer to expertise."
[04:41:40.220 --> 04:41:44.120]   I look at what the organizations say.
[04:41:44.120 --> 04:41:46.380]   I look at what the United Nations High Commissioner
[04:41:46.380 --> 04:41:47.220]   for Human Rights say.
[04:41:47.220 --> 04:41:48.080]   - You're saying it by words that you don't know.
[04:41:48.080 --> 04:41:48.920]   You don't know or you don't care.
[04:41:48.920 --> 04:41:49.760]   - I don't know.
[04:41:49.760 --> 04:41:50.580]   - Okay, that's fine.
[04:41:50.580 --> 04:41:51.760]   - Do you know how complicated?
[04:41:51.760 --> 04:41:54.960]   Have you ever investigated how complicated
[04:41:54.960 --> 04:41:58.720]   is the metric for hunger, starvation, and famine?
[04:41:58.720 --> 04:42:02.520]   It is such a complicated metric they figured out.
[04:42:02.520 --> 04:42:05.640]   If you asked me to repeat it now, I couldn't do it.
[04:42:05.640 --> 04:42:07.440]   - And yet we have a Human Development Index
[04:42:07.440 --> 04:42:08.280]   where we rank countries.
[04:42:08.280 --> 04:42:10.240]   Yet we can still measure infant mortality,
[04:42:10.240 --> 04:42:12.100]   life expectancy.
[04:42:12.100 --> 04:42:14.360]   - Yeah, we can measure all of these things.
[04:42:14.360 --> 04:42:17.040]   - Muin, I'm holding out for you here.
[04:42:17.040 --> 04:42:18.680]   You still didn't answer the hope question.
[04:42:18.680 --> 04:42:22.720]   What gives you a source of hope about the region?
[04:42:22.720 --> 04:42:26.400]   - Well, first of all, I would agree with Benny Morris
[04:42:26.400 --> 04:42:31.400]   and Norman Finkelstein that the current situation is bleak.
[04:42:31.400 --> 04:42:36.640]   And I think it would be unreasonable to expect it
[04:42:37.320 --> 04:42:42.140]   to not get even bleaker in the coming weeks and months.
[04:42:42.140 --> 04:42:46.420]   And we now, this conflict really,
[04:42:46.420 --> 04:42:49.360]   it originated in the late 19th century.
[04:42:49.360 --> 04:42:54.360]   It's been a more or less active conflict
[04:42:54.360 --> 04:42:56.800]   since the 1920s, 1930s.
[04:42:56.800 --> 04:43:02.940]   And it has produced a tremendous amount of suffering
[04:43:02.940 --> 04:43:07.620]   and regional conflict and geopolitical complications
[04:43:07.620 --> 04:43:08.560]   and all of that.
[04:43:08.560 --> 04:43:11.780]   But what gives me hope is that
[04:43:11.780 --> 04:43:14.080]   throughout their entire ordeal,
[04:43:14.080 --> 04:43:17.180]   the Palestinian people have never surrendered.
[04:43:17.180 --> 04:43:20.560]   And I believe they never will surrender
[04:43:20.560 --> 04:43:24.140]   to overwhelming force and violence.
[04:43:24.140 --> 04:43:27.500]   They have taken everything that Israel has thrown at them.
[04:43:27.500 --> 04:43:31.260]   They have taken everything that the West has thrown at them.
[04:43:31.260 --> 04:43:33.460]   They have taken everything that those
[04:43:33.460 --> 04:43:35.740]   who are supposed to be their natural allies
[04:43:35.740 --> 04:43:39.780]   have on occasion thrown at them.
[04:43:39.780 --> 04:43:42.300]   But this is a people that never has,
[04:43:42.300 --> 04:43:45.660]   and I believe never will surrender.
[04:43:45.660 --> 04:43:50.660]   And at a certain point, I think Israel and its leaders
[04:43:50.660 --> 04:43:56.340]   will have to come to the realization
[04:43:56.340 --> 04:43:58.440]   that by hook or by crook,
[04:43:58.440 --> 04:44:05.260]   these people are going to achieve their inalienable
[04:44:05.260 --> 04:44:09.020]   and legitimate national rights.
[04:44:09.020 --> 04:44:12.660]   And that is going to be a reality.
[04:44:12.660 --> 04:44:15.500]   - What do you mean by that?
[04:44:15.500 --> 04:44:17.980]   You mean all of Palestine, is that what you mean?
[04:44:17.980 --> 04:44:19.060]   - No, and--
[04:44:19.060 --> 04:44:20.540]   - From the river to the sea.
[04:44:20.540 --> 04:44:22.820]   - Well, ideally, of course, yes.
[04:44:22.820 --> 04:44:25.660]   - Those inalienable rights.
[04:44:25.660 --> 04:44:27.260]   - No, what I was saying earlier,
[04:44:27.260 --> 04:44:29.820]   and then the discussion got sidetracked,
[04:44:29.820 --> 04:44:34.820]   is that I did believe that a two-state settlement,
[04:44:34.820 --> 04:44:40.980]   a partition of Palestine along the 1967 boundaries
[04:44:40.980 --> 04:44:47.140]   would have been a reasonable solution
[04:44:47.140 --> 04:44:52.020]   because I think it also would have opened pathways
[04:44:52.020 --> 04:44:54.340]   to further--
[04:44:54.340 --> 04:44:55.700]   - But now you believe what?
[04:44:55.700 --> 04:44:57.740]   - Further nonviolent engagement
[04:44:57.740 --> 04:44:59.220]   between Israel and the Palestinians
[04:44:59.220 --> 04:45:03.260]   that could create other forms of coexistence
[04:45:03.260 --> 04:45:06.420]   in a federal or binational or other--
[04:45:06.420 --> 04:45:08.220]   - What do you think about refugees in regards to that?
[04:45:08.220 --> 04:45:09.580]   Do you think there has to be a resettlement
[04:45:09.580 --> 04:45:10.780]   of the five or six million,
[04:45:10.780 --> 04:45:13.280]   whoever wants to lay claim to being a sentence of return?
[04:45:13.280 --> 04:45:17.260]   - I think there has to be an explicit acknowledgement
[04:45:17.260 --> 04:45:23.460]   of the responsibility and of the rights.
[04:45:24.460 --> 04:45:28.780]   I think that in the framework of a two-state settlement,
[04:45:28.780 --> 04:45:32.800]   I think a formula would need to be found
[04:45:32.800 --> 04:45:37.800]   that does not undermine the foundations
[04:45:37.800 --> 04:45:40.020]   of a two-state settlement.
[04:45:40.020 --> 04:45:43.020]   And I don't think it would be that difficult
[04:45:43.020 --> 04:45:47.580]   because I suspect that there are probably large numbers
[04:45:47.580 --> 04:45:49.900]   of Palestinian refugees who,
[04:45:49.900 --> 04:45:53.140]   once their rights are acknowledged,
[04:45:53.140 --> 04:45:56.500]   will find it exceptionally distasteful--
[04:45:56.500 --> 04:45:57.340]   - Canada.
[04:45:57.340 --> 04:46:00.860]   - Exceptionally distasteful to have to live
[04:46:00.860 --> 04:46:02.380]   among the kind of sentiments
[04:46:02.380 --> 04:46:05.540]   that we've heard around this table today, to be quite frank.
[04:46:05.540 --> 04:46:09.760]   I mean, I heard, I was previously unfamiliar with you,
[04:46:09.760 --> 04:46:14.300]   and I watched one of your preparation videos.
[04:46:14.300 --> 04:46:16.500]   Very disconcerting stuff, I have to say.
[04:46:16.500 --> 04:46:18.260]   You were explaining two days ago
[04:46:18.260 --> 04:46:21.660]   in the discussion about apartheid and how absurd it was
[04:46:21.660 --> 04:46:25.140]   that, in your view, Jim Crow was not apartheid.
[04:46:25.140 --> 04:46:27.100]   Jim Crow was not apartheid.
[04:46:27.100 --> 04:46:29.860]   But Arab states not giving citizenship
[04:46:29.860 --> 04:46:32.740]   to Palestinian refugees is apartheid.
[04:46:32.740 --> 04:46:35.220]   That's what I meant with my earlier comments
[04:46:35.220 --> 04:46:36.460]   about white supremacy.
[04:46:36.460 --> 04:46:39.460]   - So my issue, that's great, the white supremacy comment.
[04:46:39.460 --> 04:46:40.940]   Well, hold on, let me respond, okay?
[04:46:40.940 --> 04:46:43.020]   My issue is that I feel like we have jumped
[04:46:43.020 --> 04:46:44.540]   on this euphemistic treadmill,
[04:46:44.540 --> 04:46:45.940]   and I think that's part of the reason
[04:46:45.940 --> 04:46:48.460]   why this conflict will never get solved,
[04:46:48.460 --> 04:46:50.200]   is because on one end, you've got a people
[04:46:50.200 --> 04:46:51.820]   who are now convinced internationally
[04:46:51.820 --> 04:46:54.500]   that they're victims of apartheid, genocide,
[04:46:54.500 --> 04:46:57.940]   concentration camp conditions, ethnic cleansing,
[04:46:57.940 --> 04:47:00.260]   they're forced to live in an open-air prison,
[04:47:00.260 --> 04:47:02.620]   with all of these things that are stacked against them,
[04:47:02.620 --> 04:47:04.540]   all of these terms that are highly specific,
[04:47:04.540 --> 04:47:07.220]   that refer to very precise things,
[04:47:07.220 --> 04:47:08.060]   and then when people like you say that they should--
[04:47:08.060 --> 04:47:10.060]   - I would expect nothing less from someone
[04:47:10.060 --> 04:47:12.060]   who doesn't think Jim Crow was apartheid.
[04:47:12.060 --> 04:47:12.900]   - I don't know if Jim--
[04:47:12.900 --> 04:47:14.380]   - But who does think that Arab states
[04:47:14.380 --> 04:47:15.220]   not giving-- - Because the problem
[04:47:15.220 --> 04:47:16.040]   is you're morally loading.
[04:47:16.040 --> 04:47:18.540]   For you, apartheid is when racists do bad things.
[04:47:18.540 --> 04:47:19.380]   - No, no. - Right?
[04:47:19.380 --> 04:47:21.300]   - There's a definition of apartheid.
[04:47:21.300 --> 04:47:22.140]   - That's great.
[04:47:22.140 --> 04:47:22.980]   - There's a very clear definition of apartheid.
[04:47:22.980 --> 04:47:25.300]   - But the specific top-down racial domination
[04:47:25.300 --> 04:47:28.020]   enacted through top-down federal legislative policies
[04:47:28.020 --> 04:47:32.260]   or whatever, means that I don't know if Jim Crow
[04:47:32.260 --> 04:47:33.380]   would have qualified for apartheid.
[04:47:33.380 --> 04:47:34.200]   That doesn't make it any less--
[04:47:34.200 --> 04:47:35.040]   - Have you ever heard--
[04:47:35.040 --> 04:47:35.880]   - Excuse me, Finkelstein, I'm talking right now.
[04:47:35.880 --> 04:47:36.700]   - Have you ever heard--
[04:47:36.700 --> 04:47:40.460]   - Finkelstein, I'm talking to your friend over here.
[04:47:40.460 --> 04:47:41.580]   I don't know if it would have qualified
[04:47:41.580 --> 04:47:42.780]   as the crime of apartheid.
[04:47:42.780 --> 04:47:44.780]   Just like if Israel were to literally nuke
[04:47:44.780 --> 04:47:45.980]   the Gaza Strip and kill two million people,
[04:47:45.980 --> 04:47:46.820]   I don't know if that would qualify
[04:47:46.820 --> 04:47:47.660]   for the crime of genocide.
[04:47:47.660 --> 04:47:48.620]   - In your eyes, probably not.
[04:47:48.620 --> 04:47:49.460]   - I don't, well, yeah,
[04:47:49.460 --> 04:47:51.240]   but because genocide requires a special intent.
[04:47:51.240 --> 04:47:53.460]   I think the issue is, instead of,
[04:47:53.460 --> 04:47:54.620]   and I think this conversation is actually,
[04:47:54.620 --> 04:47:56.780]   is emblematic of the entire conversation.
[04:47:56.780 --> 04:47:57.620]   I don't think anything--
[04:47:57.620 --> 04:47:58.740]   - And let me finish answering
[04:47:58.740 --> 04:47:59.580]   Benny Morris's question. - Well, sure,
[04:47:59.580 --> 04:48:01.500]   but you accused me of supporting racism, so yeah.
[04:48:01.500 --> 04:48:03.280]   - Well, you did, and you are.
[04:48:03.280 --> 04:48:06.420]   - I did it, do you think I support Jim Crow laws?
[04:48:06.420 --> 04:48:07.240]   - Look, when--
[04:48:07.240 --> 04:48:08.860]   - The fact that you can't even answer that honestly, right?
[04:48:08.860 --> 04:48:09.700]   - It doesn't matter what--
[04:48:09.700 --> 04:48:10.780]   - You wouldn't say that 800 civilians
[04:48:10.780 --> 04:48:12.060]   were killed by Hamas.
[04:48:12.060 --> 04:48:14.140]   You said, well, maybe 400 were killed by Israel.
[04:48:14.140 --> 04:48:15.100]   - No, I didn't say that. - I don't know the number,
[04:48:15.100 --> 04:48:15.940]   maybe. - No, I didn't say that.
[04:48:15.940 --> 04:48:17.300]   - Yes, you said 400. - No, I didn't say that.
[04:48:17.300 --> 04:48:18.580]   - You co-signed the opinion.
[04:48:18.580 --> 04:48:19.420]   - No, I didn't. - No, I didn't.
[04:48:19.420 --> 04:48:20.260]   - He said majority-- - No, I didn't.
[04:48:20.260 --> 04:48:21.780]   - Well, wait, how many, what do you,
[04:48:21.780 --> 04:48:23.700]   I think the word was some, that's what I heard.
[04:48:23.700 --> 04:48:25.300]   - No, I think-- - Well, you weren't listening.
[04:48:25.300 --> 04:48:26.780]   - How many people do you think approximately,
[04:48:26.780 --> 04:48:28.540]   if you had to ballpark it,
[04:48:28.540 --> 04:48:30.700]   how many do you think were killed by Hamas on October 7th?
[04:48:30.700 --> 04:48:35.340]   - I think it's pretty clear that the majority of civilians
[04:48:35.340 --> 04:48:36.300]   that were killed-- - That's what you said.
[04:48:36.300 --> 04:48:38.500]   - 51% or 90%?
[04:48:38.500 --> 04:48:40.100]   - Don't ask me to put a number--
[04:48:40.100 --> 04:48:40.940]   - I just want to ballpark.
[04:48:40.940 --> 04:48:42.340]   Those are two very different intuitions.
[04:48:42.340 --> 04:48:44.460]   - First of all, when you say Hamas,
[04:48:44.460 --> 04:48:45.420]   do you mean Palestinians,
[04:48:45.420 --> 04:48:46.260]   or do you mean Hamas specifically?
[04:48:46.260 --> 04:48:47.820]   - I mean the invading Palestinian force.
[04:48:47.820 --> 04:48:49.060]   I don't like to say Palestinians,
[04:48:49.060 --> 04:48:50.780]   because I don't think all Palestinian civilians
[04:48:50.780 --> 04:48:51.620]   were involved in attacks.
[04:48:51.620 --> 04:48:53.820]   I'll say Hamas, Islamic Jihad, whatever, al-Quds,
[04:48:53.820 --> 04:48:54.660]   whatever other-- - But that's how
[04:48:54.660 --> 04:48:55.700]   this discussion started.
[04:48:55.700 --> 04:48:57.820]   You said Hamas, and I began to answer that,
[04:48:57.820 --> 04:48:59.780]   and then Benny Morris said, actually,
[04:48:59.780 --> 04:49:03.020]   he means Hamas in addition to Jihad and the others, so.
[04:49:03.020 --> 04:49:06.020]   - So of the invading Palestinian force,
[04:49:06.020 --> 04:49:08.420]   how many do you think killed civilians versus the IDF?
[04:49:08.420 --> 04:49:10.060]   What do you think, the ballpark, the percentage?
[04:49:10.060 --> 04:49:12.900]   - Well, the figures we have are that about a third
[04:49:12.900 --> 04:49:15.420]   of the casualties on October 7th were military,
[04:49:15.420 --> 04:49:16.820]   and about 2/3 were-- - That's not what I asked at all.
[04:49:16.820 --> 04:49:17.660]   - What's your question?
[04:49:17.660 --> 04:49:19.660]   - How many, what percentage of civilians--
[04:49:19.660 --> 04:49:20.500]   - How many of the 2/3? - I think were killed
[04:49:20.500 --> 04:49:22.340]   by the invading force, a ballpark.
[04:49:22.340 --> 04:49:23.660]   - I think a clear majority,
[04:49:23.660 --> 04:49:25.700]   but I can't give you a specific figure.
[04:49:25.700 --> 04:49:28.300]   - If you thought it was closer to 51% or 99%,
[04:49:28.300 --> 04:49:30.220]   were killed by-- - Why would he know that?
[04:49:30.220 --> 04:49:31.700]   How would he know that? - It's because it's interesting
[04:49:31.700 --> 04:49:33.180]   to actually stake out a position.
[04:49:33.180 --> 04:49:34.140]   - Yeah, it's interesting-- - If you want to be
[04:49:34.140 --> 04:49:35.660]   completely, totally agnostic on it, that's fine.
[04:49:35.660 --> 04:49:37.660]   - They start complete ignorance,
[04:49:37.660 --> 04:49:40.740]   because we don't know, Professor Morris doesn't know,
[04:49:40.740 --> 04:49:41.940]   Muin Rabbani doesn't know-- - And yet you can speak
[04:49:41.940 --> 04:49:44.380]   with absolute certainty that the IDF is targeting
[04:49:44.380 --> 04:49:46.700]   and murdering Palestinian children intentionally.
[04:49:46.700 --> 04:49:47.700]   Do you see the double standard?
[04:49:47.700 --> 04:49:49.500]   - No, I don't, you see-- - I know you don't.
[04:49:49.500 --> 04:49:52.020]   - I know, I don't see it, you know why?
[04:49:52.020 --> 04:49:55.860]   Because I looked at the UN report.
[04:49:55.860 --> 04:49:57.300]   I looked at the UN-- - The Goldstone report?
[04:49:57.300 --> 04:50:02.300]   - No, the UN report on the Great March of Return in 2018,
[04:50:02.300 --> 04:50:06.620]   and they said that the snipers were targeting
[04:50:06.620 --> 04:50:11.540]   children, medics, journalists, and disabled people.
[04:50:11.540 --> 04:50:13.540]   - Just as they are now in this conflict.
[04:50:13.540 --> 04:50:14.580]   - Exactly.
[04:50:14.580 --> 04:50:17.660]   - No, more journalists have been killed
[04:50:17.660 --> 04:50:19.620]   in the last several months in Gaza
[04:50:19.620 --> 04:50:21.420]   than in any other conflict. - Do you acknowledge that?
[04:50:21.420 --> 04:50:22.240]   - And in all of World War II. - Let me finish.
[04:50:22.240 --> 04:50:23.080]   - Do you acknowledge that Hamas--
[04:50:23.080 --> 04:50:24.500]   - And in all of World War II. - That's great,
[04:50:24.500 --> 04:50:25.960]   the comparison is fun. - Hamas is not killing
[04:50:25.960 --> 04:50:26.800]   journalists in the Gaza Strip.
[04:50:26.800 --> 04:50:28.540]   - Does Hamas, do you agree that they operate
[04:50:28.540 --> 04:50:29.900]   in civilian uniforms, that their goal
[04:50:29.900 --> 04:50:32.240]   is to induce that confusion, that that's the way
[04:50:32.240 --> 04:50:33.780]   that they conduct themselves militarily?
[04:50:33.780 --> 04:50:34.980]   - Let me finish my point.
[04:50:34.980 --> 04:50:37.180]   More journalists have been-- - I understand.
[04:50:37.180 --> 04:50:39.420]   - More U.S-- - He doesn't wanna hear it.
[04:50:39.420 --> 04:50:40.620]   So far, it's fine. - No, because it's virtue--
[04:50:40.620 --> 04:50:41.460]   - It's so far. - You're not having
[04:50:41.460 --> 04:50:42.980]   a material, a substantial-- - Virtue signaling.
[04:50:42.980 --> 04:50:44.380]   - It is virtue signaling. - Virtue signaling, yeah.
[04:50:44.380 --> 04:50:46.220]   - Yes, like when you say children over and over again,
[04:50:46.220 --> 04:50:47.300]   that's virtue signaling. - But talking about,
[04:50:47.300 --> 04:50:48.920]   you know, you have this-- - Talking about how many,
[04:50:48.920 --> 04:50:49.760]   you have this habit of mocking the dead.
[04:50:49.760 --> 04:50:51.700]   - Talking about how many Israelis were killed,
[04:50:51.700 --> 04:50:54.780]   that's not virtue signaling, 'cause that's human life.
[04:50:54.780 --> 04:50:56.180]   - I don't care about, I don't care
[04:50:56.180 --> 04:50:58.100]   if 100 are killed or 1,000 are, I'm curious
[04:50:58.100 --> 04:50:59.300]   who you're assigning blame to. - You just interrogate
[04:50:59.460 --> 04:51:00.620]   51%, 90%, and then-- - I'm curious
[04:51:00.620 --> 04:51:02.360]   who you're assigning the question, yes.
[04:51:02.360 --> 04:51:03.780]   - And then Muin-- - That's not the number,
[04:51:03.780 --> 04:51:05.380]   that's the responsibility norm.
[04:51:05.380 --> 04:51:09.460]   - And then Muin, Muin mentions that more journalists
[04:51:09.460 --> 04:51:12.760]   were killed in Gaza than in all of World War II.
[04:51:12.760 --> 04:51:13.660]   - That doesn't get it, that doesn't
[04:51:13.660 --> 04:51:15.660]   further any part of the-- - And more medics
[04:51:15.660 --> 04:51:17.500]   were killed in Gaza. - No, no, that's silly.
[04:51:17.500 --> 04:51:19.140]   - And then he says-- - Journalists--
[04:51:19.140 --> 04:51:21.300]   - It's virtue signaling. - Weren't on the area.
[04:51:21.300 --> 04:51:25.060]   - But when Israelis get killed, that's serious.
[04:51:25.060 --> 04:51:26.820]   - I never said it's serious on both sides.
[04:51:26.820 --> 04:51:28.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I didn't say it's federal.
[04:51:28.740 --> 04:51:31.240]   - No, no, no, no, I'm not virtue signaling.
[04:51:31.240 --> 04:51:32.620]   I'm asking a substantive question
[04:51:32.620 --> 04:51:33.860]   of who do you assign blame to,
[04:51:33.860 --> 04:51:36.140]   or do you play into Norm Finkelstein's conspiracies
[04:51:36.140 --> 04:51:38.100]   that the ambulances should have known immediately
[04:51:38.100 --> 04:51:39.660]   who was dead, that the numbers were changed
[04:51:39.660 --> 04:51:42.340]   'cause they were fake, or that maybe 51%
[04:51:42.340 --> 04:51:45.500]   of the people were killed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad,
[04:51:45.500 --> 04:51:48.140]   but 49% were killed by IED helicopters.
[04:51:48.140 --> 04:51:49.660]   - You asked me a direct question,
[04:51:49.660 --> 04:51:52.000]   and you got a direct answer. - I didn't, I got majority,
[04:51:52.000 --> 04:51:53.380]   which could be-- - I said a clear,
[04:51:53.380 --> 04:51:55.820]   I said a clear majority. - What percent
[04:51:55.820 --> 04:51:56.980]   is a clear majority?
[04:51:56.980 --> 04:51:57.820]   As opposed to a majority-- - It's always,
[04:51:57.820 --> 04:51:58.640]   they live in ambiguity, of course.
[04:51:58.640 --> 04:52:01.220]   - A clear majority, in my view, is well over 50%.
[04:52:01.220 --> 04:52:03.620]   Please don't ask me to be more precise,
[04:52:03.620 --> 04:52:06.580]   because I can't-- - You could say 80, 90, 95%.
[04:52:06.580 --> 04:52:08.180]   - If I knew that, I would say it.
[04:52:08.180 --> 04:52:10.180]   - I think it's a reasonable, it's a reasonable--
[04:52:10.180 --> 04:52:11.820]   - Perhaps it is, but I--
[04:52:11.820 --> 04:52:15.820]   - You're not the best person to be asking that question.
[04:52:15.820 --> 04:52:17.500]   You know, I read when you wrote,
[04:52:17.500 --> 04:52:20.540]   described Operation Defensive Shield,
[04:52:20.540 --> 04:52:23.180]   and you said a few dozen homes were destroyed.
[04:52:23.180 --> 04:52:24.100]   - You're talking about what happened
[04:52:24.100 --> 04:52:25.940]   in the Jinnian refugee camp. - And you said--
[04:52:25.940 --> 04:52:27.540]   - No, the Arabs said 500.
[04:52:27.540 --> 04:52:31.100]   You guys said 500 Palestinians were killed in Jinnian.
[04:52:31.100 --> 04:52:32.300]   - No, no, no. - I never said that.
[04:52:32.300 --> 04:52:33.340]   I never said that. - No, but that was
[04:52:33.340 --> 04:52:36.500]   the statement of the PLO, the Palestinian Authority.
[04:52:36.500 --> 04:52:37.900]   - You said a few dozen homes-- - And that there were
[04:52:37.900 --> 04:52:39.100]   massacres there. - There were a few
[04:52:39.100 --> 04:52:40.380]   dozen homes ago. - Yes, a few dozen homes.
[04:52:40.380 --> 04:52:41.220]   - Yeah. - That's right.
[04:52:41.220 --> 04:52:44.660]   - Well, it turned out 140 buildings were destroyed.
[04:52:44.660 --> 04:52:49.220]   5,000 people, 5,000 people were left homeless.
[04:52:49.220 --> 04:52:50.900]   - How many were killed? - You just, 5,000.
[04:52:50.900 --> 04:52:52.180]   - How many were killed? - You described it,
[04:52:52.180 --> 04:52:54.300]   no, I'm talking about homes destroyed.
[04:52:54.300 --> 04:52:57.740]   So you're not the best person to be criticizing
[04:52:57.740 --> 04:53:01.260]   what Muin says when he says clear majority,
[04:53:01.260 --> 04:53:02.300]   but he can't say more.
[04:53:02.300 --> 04:53:03.500]   You know why he can't say more?
[04:53:03.500 --> 04:53:05.380]   - He doesn't know. - He doesn't know.
[04:53:05.380 --> 04:53:06.740]   - Yeah, yeah, I understand that.
[04:53:06.740 --> 04:53:10.180]   - I hope as a historian-- - If I was trying to belittle,
[04:53:10.180 --> 04:53:11.780]   I would give you a very different answer.
[04:53:11.780 --> 04:53:13.300]   I would just say, I don't know.
[04:53:13.300 --> 04:53:14.140]   I do know that somewhere-- - The right phrase,
[04:53:14.140 --> 04:53:16.220]   do you know what the right phrase there would be?
[04:53:16.220 --> 04:53:20.300]   The overwhelming majority were killed by Arab gunmen,
[04:53:20.300 --> 04:53:23.140]   and very small number were killed by Israelis
[04:53:23.140 --> 04:53:24.700]   by accident or whatever.
[04:53:24.700 --> 04:53:25.540]   That's probably true. - You're not speaking
[04:53:25.540 --> 04:53:26.900]   as a historian, though. - That's probably true.
[04:53:26.900 --> 04:53:29.980]   - That may be, I can state with confidence
[04:53:29.980 --> 04:53:32.620]   a clear majority, overwhelming majority.
[04:53:32.620 --> 04:53:35.660]   You may be correct, but I can't state that with certainty.
[04:53:35.660 --> 04:53:37.660]   I think there's a very easy way to find out,
[04:53:37.660 --> 04:53:40.780]   is to have a independent-- - Forget independent.
[04:53:40.780 --> 04:53:41.940]   - I know you don't-- - Well, of course
[04:53:41.940 --> 04:53:43.020]   you forget independent. - Forget the law.
[04:53:43.020 --> 04:53:43.860]   - Forget, that doesn't mean anything.
[04:53:43.860 --> 04:53:45.900]   - Forget the law. - Independent as you want.
[04:53:45.900 --> 04:53:47.740]   - Independent as you want. - Forget independent
[04:53:47.740 --> 04:53:48.580]   as you want. - Human rights, Robert.
[04:53:48.580 --> 04:53:50.100]   - Not necessarily. - Just repeat the numbers.
[04:53:50.100 --> 04:53:53.380]   - They're all barbaric countries.
[04:53:53.380 --> 04:53:56.220]   Assyrian was the head of the UN Commission for Human Rights.
[04:53:56.220 --> 04:53:58.300]   - But if it wasn't Israeli, it would have been okay.
[04:53:58.300 --> 04:54:00.060]   - He certainly would have been more honest than Assyrian.
[04:54:00.060 --> 04:54:02.140]   - Of course, oh yeah, from your perspective.
[04:54:02.140 --> 04:54:03.780]   - Well, to disagree with Stephen,
[04:54:03.780 --> 04:54:06.900]   I thought this was extremely valuable.
[04:54:06.900 --> 04:54:11.160]   At times, really, the view of history, the passion.
[04:54:13.700 --> 04:54:18.060]   - I'm really grateful that you would spend
[04:54:18.060 --> 04:54:20.940]   your really valuable time, and just one more question,
[04:54:20.940 --> 04:54:25.500]   since we have two historians here.
[04:54:25.500 --> 04:54:29.660]   Well, just briefly, from a history perspective,
[04:54:29.660 --> 04:54:32.980]   what do you hope your legacy as historians,
[04:54:32.980 --> 04:54:36.420]   Benny and Norm, will be of the work
[04:54:36.420 --> 04:54:37.620]   that you've put out there?
[04:54:37.620 --> 04:54:41.060]   Maybe Norm, you can go first, and try to just say briefly.
[04:54:41.060 --> 04:54:44.620]   - I think there's a value to preserving the record.
[04:54:44.620 --> 04:54:49.060]   I'm not optimistic about where things are going to end up.
[04:54:49.060 --> 04:54:50.900]   There was a very nice book written
[04:54:50.900 --> 04:54:53.300]   by a woman named Helen Hunt Jackson,
[04:54:53.300 --> 04:54:56.780]   at the end of the 19th century,
[04:54:56.780 --> 04:54:59.540]   describing what was done to the Native Americans.
[04:54:59.540 --> 04:55:02.140]   She called it a century of dishonor,
[04:55:02.140 --> 04:55:06.700]   and she described in vivid, poignant detail
[04:55:06.700 --> 04:55:09.180]   what was done to the Native Americans.
[04:55:09.180 --> 04:55:10.980]   Did it save them? No.
[04:55:10.980 --> 04:55:15.660]   Did it help them? Probably not.
[04:55:15.660 --> 04:55:18.100]   Did it preserve their memory? Yes.
[04:55:18.100 --> 04:55:20.580]   And I think there's a value to that.
[04:55:20.580 --> 04:55:24.660]   You know, there was a famous film by Eisenstein,
[04:55:24.660 --> 04:55:26.340]   Sergei Eisenstein.
[04:55:26.340 --> 04:55:28.940]   It was either "Battleship Potemkin" or "Mother."
[04:55:28.940 --> 04:55:31.260]   I can't remember which one.
[04:55:31.260 --> 04:55:35.340]   The last scene was the czar's troops
[04:55:35.340 --> 04:55:38.700]   mowing down all the Russian people.
[04:55:38.700 --> 04:55:40.260]   He pans the scene.
[04:55:40.260 --> 04:55:42.300]   - Not all the Russian people, just a few.
[04:55:42.300 --> 04:55:44.540]   - Well, he pans the massacre.
[04:55:44.540 --> 04:55:46.220]   He pans the massacre.
[04:55:46.220 --> 04:55:47.700]   - But he could have killed a lot more.
[04:55:47.700 --> 04:55:49.220]   (laughing)
[04:55:49.220 --> 04:55:51.900]   - And the last words of the movie were,
[04:55:51.900 --> 04:55:55.220]   "Proletarians, exclamation point.
[04:55:55.220 --> 04:55:58.500]   "Remember, exclamation point."
[04:55:58.500 --> 04:56:02.940]   And I've seen it as my life's work to preserve the memory,
[04:56:02.940 --> 04:56:04.820]   and to remember.
[04:56:04.820 --> 04:56:08.500]   I didn't expect that anyone would read my book on Gaza.
[04:56:08.500 --> 04:56:10.420]   It's very dense.
[04:56:10.420 --> 04:56:12.660]   It gives me even a bit of a headache
[04:56:12.660 --> 04:56:14.900]   to read at least one of the chapters.
[04:56:14.900 --> 04:56:16.140]   - You wrote a book on Gaza.
[04:56:16.140 --> 04:56:17.660]   (laughing)
[04:56:17.660 --> 04:56:21.740]   - But I thought that the memory deserves to be preserved.
[04:56:21.740 --> 04:56:22.860]   - Amen.
[04:56:22.860 --> 04:56:25.140]   - Well, I would just say very briefly,
[04:56:25.140 --> 04:56:28.780]   unlike my colleague, I think writing the truth
[04:56:28.780 --> 04:56:30.860]   about what happened in history,
[04:56:30.860 --> 04:56:33.340]   in various periods of history,
[04:56:33.340 --> 04:56:36.940]   if I've done a little bit of that, I'm happy.
[04:56:36.940 --> 04:56:37.780]   - Thank you, Norm.
[04:56:37.780 --> 04:56:38.620]   Thank you, Benny.
[04:56:38.620 --> 04:56:39.440]   Thank you, Stephen.
[04:56:39.440 --> 04:56:41.060]   Thank you, Maureen.

[04:56:53.260 --> 04:56:55.340]   from Lyndon B. Johnson.
[04:56:55.340 --> 04:56:58.500]   "Peace is a journey of a thousand miles,
[04:56:58.500 --> 04:57:02.220]   "and it must be taken one step at a time."
[04:57:02.220 --> 04:57:06.260]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
