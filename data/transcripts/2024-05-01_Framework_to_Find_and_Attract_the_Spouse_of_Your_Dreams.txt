[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.240]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   I am your host.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.720]   And on today's episode of the podcast, I want to share with you a fairly comprehensive
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.680]   outline of how to find and attract a very high quality spouse.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.440]   That is my goal, to give you a formula, a list of things that you can do that will help
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.920]   you to attract and find, find and attract, let's get it in the right order, find and
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.600]   attract a high quality spouse.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   Now you might be quickly hastening to say, Joshua, but Joshua, this show is called Radical
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.200]   Personal Finance.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.080]   What does this have to do with personal finance?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.100]   And my answer here as I begin is quite a lot, quite a lot.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200]   Now I could take, if I were more courageous, I could take the track to say that one of
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.760]   the best and most reliable pathways to your wealth and financial independence is to find
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.360]   and marry a rich person.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   I would like to do that show because it's certainly something that people talk about.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.720]   We know that it's true.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.520]   We know that some people do find and find love and marry for money.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200]   And tell you what, there's a lot of thing that seems really attractive to it, of finding
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.640]   somebody rich and marrying that person.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.240]   I'm not quite courageous enough to tackle that subject.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.840]   I'll let you do that, simply because I don't consider that to be an ideal soul quality
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.960]   to judge someone by and I don't necessarily know how to do it.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.440]   I don't know how to go out into the world and attract and find, you know, a rich heiress
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   of some kind who can support me in my lifestyle.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520]   I've known a couple of men who have done this.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.380]   Being from Palm Beach, Florida, I have known a couple of men who, a friend of mine who
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.520]   ran a stationary shop had married a very wealthy lady and he ran the shop, could give him something
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.800]   to do but she supported him and did really well.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.480]   But my reticence just comes down to being a man and I would have a hard time respecting
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   myself of going after that.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   I think there's a difference between men and women in this regard where finding and marrying
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.240]   a rich man seems to be a little easier for women to accomplish in some cases than it
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   is for men.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.580]   I think the kind of man who's going out looking for a rich woman is often not very attractive
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.240]   to the rich woman in question.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.640]   So I'll let someone with more courage than me tackle that.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.520]   On a more mundane level though, I want to tell you why this is a financial topic and
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.240]   there are two things related to it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.920]   Number one, on its face, it's obvious that your marriage decisions will impact all of
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.560]   your financial planning.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.320]   We know that the amount of income that you earn, the amount of wealth that you accumulate,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.480]   the specific expenses and obligations that you have throughout your lifetime, all of
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.160]   these are going to be affected by your decision to marry or not marry.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.000]   We know that on the positive side, marriage is a very good indicator that is reliably
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.640]   going to be one of the factors that means you're likely to wind up in the top cohort
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   of your peers in terms of wealth accumulation, income, all of the financial statistics are
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.180]   very strongly in favor of those who marry.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.080]   On the contrary, we know that those who divorce often experience an enormous financial destruction
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.560]   and it's one of the biggest risks that you can face in your life and so it's certainly
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   one of those things that matters.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.680]   The reason I like to talk about it and want to talk about it is that I always have an
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.520]   interest of going basically a level back, going a step upstream and that's how I think
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.760]   about a topic like this.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.040]   I want you to pretend for a moment that you were part – you grew up in a tribe of Indians
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.900]   in the Amazon somewhere and you have zero contact with the modern world, you're living
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.320]   out in a rural environment and you decide for some reason to take up an interest in
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.520]   personal finance.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.000]   Well, the first thing that would happen would be you would simply have to figure out some
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.720]   reason to take an interest in personal finance because in a primitive setting like that,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.440]   the whole concept of finance and money and everything like that is just not applicable.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.400]   It's only applicable in the modern world.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.160]   So let's pretend that you were going to take good financial advice.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   Well, the first thing that you would do would be to start to engage in the modern world.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.600]   You wouldn't engage in the modern world at the level of saving money into a retirement
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.920]   account or lowering your tax bill.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.560]   You would engage in the modern world on the level of learning how to earn money, learning
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.800]   how to earn income for wages, learning how to spend money.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   But if we take it a step back further, we can see that behind all of these decisions
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.480]   there's always one more level, one more level, one more level, one more level.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.520]   And so if we look at somebody who is, let's say, a stereotypical aristocrat born and raised
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.080]   with a silver spoon in his mouth, and we go back to the very beginning, what we'll see
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.760]   is that there are so many levels that ultimately produce that aristocrat that if we plumb the
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   depths of those we can learn from them.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.240]   We can go all the way back to the foundation of a civilization.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.440]   We can go – and what I'm saying here is we can go back before genetic seed, right?
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.480]   The topic of genetics is an important component of personal finance because we are all a basic
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.160]   product of our genes.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   And so the ability that our parents had to find and attract one another and produce intelligent
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.640]   and handsome children is a fundamental aspect of our long-term financial success.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.000]   We can even go back to the society, the society that is stable and holds us.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.080]   And so my point is that when we talk about finance, if we exclusively restrict our conversation
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.400]   to those things that are covered on the CFP exam, we can approach one level of success.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.920]   But for everything that is covered on the CFP exam, if you go back one more level, you
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   can often find a factor that, if it's optimized, can sweep everything else away.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.120]   Again, the example I always like to use is simply you can practice frugal living and
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.880]   savings and good investing over time, but if you just have an enormous income or build
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.580]   an enormous business, then all of the need for the day-to-day penny-pinching stuff goes
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.840]   out the window.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.080]   So it would behoove us to spend time focusing on the things that are one level up.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.560]   And today's podcast is one of those things.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.200]   And so I believe that this is a financial topic, and that's why I want to present it
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040]   to you in the context of radical personal finance, because it's one of those foundational
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.200]   topics that most people don't cover.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   But if you get this right, it can go really well.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.160]   Back to the marrying a rich spouse is simply that my wife got it right.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.920]   She married me, and I've paid every bill, and she's had as much money as she needed
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.760]   ever since that time.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:40.900]   And so her pathway to financial independence, in her case, depended very much on her getting
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.040]   the marriage thing right.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.760]   And we didn't have an easy road into marriage, but once we got on that road, then everything
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.000]   worked out well enough for her, at least so far.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   Now, that's not to say that things couldn't go wrong in the future.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.900]   We have to protect against that.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.920]   That's why we talk about life insurance and health insurance and proper divorce planning
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.200]   and all the stuff that goes with everything, so that it continues to go right with her.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.040]   But that these concepts and what I'm going to share is fundamentally important.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.840]   And so if you want to marry rich, you want to marry a rich man or a rich woman, I'm going
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.200]   to describe to you in this podcast a formula as to how you can accomplish that and get
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   you on the road to that if that's something that you are interested in.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.320]   If you are just interested in marrying somebody who has other qualities that you admire, I'm
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.960]   going to give you a formula in today's podcast to help you accomplish those personal goals.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.540]   Before I get to that formula, I want to also give one quick apologetic for marriage.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.380]   There are two basic decisions that shape the actual experience you have of life over the
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.600]   long term.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.240]   Decisions to marry or not marry and decisions to have children or not have children are
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.040]   two of those basic decisions.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   There are a couple others, but those are two fundamental decisions.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.760]   Now separately in other episodes of the podcast, I've talked about the decision to have children.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.180]   I've tried to make an apologetic for that most people should consider having children.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.280]   I want to make a quick apologetic here for marriage.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.360]   And I want to talk about why I feel such a burden to share this formula and help you.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.560]   It has to do with, frankly, the success of our culture on a broad macro level all the
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.760]   way down to a personal level, the just simple happiness that you and I will experience by
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.320]   being well-partnered in life.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.920]   Historically all successful and enduring societies have built some kind of social construct that
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:46.600]   naturally funneled most young people into marriage and procreation, family growth.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.240]   If a society is not able to accomplish that, it will fail in the fullness of time.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.000]   Every society that is not able to create a stable population that stabilizes the needs
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.380]   and the desires of young men and women ultimately falls to some influence.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.440]   You oftentimes, for example, if you have a polygamous society, you'll often have so much
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.600]   unrest by the unwed men in society who aren't able to compete with the high value men who
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.560]   take all the wives that results in social decay over time.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.260]   You have societies in which there's men and women are kept separate, just they collapse
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   over time.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.040]   And then ultimately if a society doesn't have children, doesn't maintain high birth rates,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.840]   it gets subsumed by some other society that does.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   So our society, the one that you and I live in, also previously had such a social construct
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.000]   that naturally funneled most young people into marriage and family growth.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.320]   But speaking broadly of Western civilization, U.S. American culture that I come from, and
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.960]   perhaps the various subcultures and microcultures that I represent and you represent to some
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.920]   degree, our society once did that, but that's broadly collapsed.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   We have replaced the shaping power of marriage as an institution that forms people with the
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:17.040]   false belief that only perfect and perfectly self-actualized human beings should marry.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.760]   We have replaced raising children as a natural and normal life goal with alternative goals,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.160]   such as making money and retiring early as the primary life goals to pursue.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.560]   So if you and I desire for our families, our cultures, and our societies to continue and
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.360]   to flourish, we have to change some of these problems.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.960]   And because this is all upstream of finance, if we don't get it right, our financial lives
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.860]   are much, much more difficult.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:55.680]   If we live in a society of increased cultural conflict due to poorly partnered men and women,
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.680]   if we live in a society that is old, growing older, graying, even all of our welfare programs
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.820]   fall apart, our social security and other government benefits that would see to us in
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.880]   our old age, these are all predicated upon a young and growing society.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.820]   And so we would have much bigger problems.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.720]   And so we want to talk about this stuff and we want to deal with it straight on.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.520]   And we want to focus on dealing with it straight on so that we can develop strategies to help
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.980]   ourselves and also our children so that our society becomes one that is expanding and
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:36.840]   growing and spreading out and subsuming other inferior cultures in the fullness of time.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.440]   The decision to marry is largely based upon your meeting an acceptable marriage partner
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:50.440]   at an appropriate phase of life and then being able to successfully attract and woo that
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.800]   person into a committed marriage with you.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.480]   I think the default natural evidence-based desire or decision for most people should
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.980]   be to marry.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.460]   That should be the default choice.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:10.680]   And we should not shy away from installing that default choice, that default ambition
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.600]   into our children, into our neighbors, into our society around.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.800]   We know that all of the sociological data that we have shows that whether by objective
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.120]   metrics such as health, health span, life span, or subjective metrics such as self-reported
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.760]   happiness and satisfaction with life or various other self-reported metrics, that married
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   people outperform unmarried people on, I want to say all, I'd say most because I haven't
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.060]   seen all, all the ones that I've ever seen.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:48.220]   I don't know of a metric that married people don't outperform unmarried people on.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.980]   Now we obviously need to think carefully about survivorship bias because divorced people,
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.460]   especially recently divorced people, tend to have a very low opinion of marriage.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.420]   And they want to contradict all of the data and statistics that I have just said.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.020]   Although their opinion of marriage somehow tends to change over time.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.300]   I've lived long enough now to work with and talk with a number of people who have gotten
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:16.580]   married then gotten divorced and there's a remarkable chain of events that tends to happen.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:22.820]   Within the months and sometimes years immediately after divorce, you'll hear people swear by
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.940]   everything that is dear to them that they will never ever again marry.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.140]   And then something happens sometime later.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.320]   Usually they meet a certain someone or a certain series of someones and they kind of soften
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.300]   up and then all of a sudden they're married again and they're proclaiming the benefits
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.780]   of their best decision ever.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.580]   There are some who go the other way and follow through on that long-term vow not to marry,
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.600]   but there are few and far in between.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.780]   And so we should be careful here.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.620]   Obviously I don't want to deal flippantly with any of these things.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.820]   These are important.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.140]   But our bias should be that all of the evidence is that most people should marry.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.780]   And that, again, the metrics that we can measure indicate that they're better off in the fullness
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.940]   of time.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.100]   And we shouldn't be ashamed to study those metrics, learn from them, and then share them
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.300]   with others.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.540]   Because even when talking about divorce and its damaging effects, what I'm talking about
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.900]   in this podcast is going to be fundamental to avoiding that.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.500]   Divorce does not happen accidentally or randomly.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.020]   It's not randomly distributed.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.060]   There's an effect that comes from certain causes.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.900]   And while not all causes of divorce can be avoided for all people, many or at least I
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.540]   would say most or at least many of them can be avoided by better attention to the formula
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.740]   that I'm going to give you here in this podcast.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.020]   We know that other lifestyles really don't work in the long term.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:52.140]   For example, singleness, or let's just start with celibacy, single celibacy is not a long-term
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.820]   winner for most people just due to their basic biological urges.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.740]   There are some people who have been able to master those urges, but in general long-term
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.280]   celibacy is not a lifestyle that most people have pursued voluntarily.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:14.660]   We know that promiscuous sexual behavior outside of marriage is empty and/or hollow for most
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.140]   normal people after some amount of time.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.300]   Sometimes it's empty and hollow very quickly.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.920]   Some people go on for a decade living a promiscuous lifestyle of fornication and then they realize
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.000]   that that really wasn't a big winner and they ultimately change and walk away from that.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.300]   There are some people who don't.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:41.580]   Our society is full of psychopaths and sociopaths and perverts and we can go through the names
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:47.260]   of P. Diddy in the news right now or Jeffrey Epstein or Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.660]   or Oscar Wilde or Marquis de Sade or all of these perverts that throughout history have
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   been around.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.660]   We know that sociopaths and psychopaths will continue in their destructive behavior and
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.340]   we have to restrain them as a society.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:06.940]   But generally speaking, most arrangements other than one man, one woman marriage don't
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.060]   work in the long term.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:15.620]   So it's better for us to give attention to what we know does work effectively, what should
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.300]   be the default option for people, to teach our young people that this should be the default
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.940]   option because we know that it's the best default option and then try to solve the issues
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.820]   that arise from that.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:35.180]   So rather than sacrificing a generation to wander around with a lifelong pursuit of self-actualization
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:40.100]   and arrive at the end of life wondering if it was worth it, since we can measure that
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.780]   stuff pretty effectively, we should focus more on solving the problems with marriage
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:53.500]   itself and then our next generation will be in a stronger place.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.020]   And so how do we solve some of the issues with marriage?
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.180]   Well some of them ultimately are legal and there's many layers that some are cultural,
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.020]   some are social, but at its core we have the best chance of solving the problems that are
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.620]   closest to us.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.620]   And I think there are a couple that I want to really focus on.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:18.140]   First we diligently prepare people for marriage, especially by making sure that individuals
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.920]   have a good exposure to the world, a good sense of who they are and what they're looking
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.420]   for in life.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:31.020]   And then we give individuals, unmarried individuals, the tools to attract a high-quality spouse
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.820]   so that they would have the best possible chance of building an enduring and high-quality
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.820]   marriage relationship.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.340]   So I'd like to talk about how do we prepare young people for marriage.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.380]   Because if you start doing what I'm doing and you talk about what I'm about to do, you
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.580]   speak about marriage while young, you will quickly hear and receive a well-intended,
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.420]   well-meaning objection.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.860]   Someone will say, "We don't want people to get married too young.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.140]   After all, young people don't even know themselves or they haven't even had a chance to get to
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.700]   know the world in some way.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.640]   Marrying too young is a problem."
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.420]   And I'm inclined myself to agree with this objection.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.200]   I don't want to encourage marriage that is too young.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.620]   But before I agree with the objection, let me point out the hypocrisy of this objection
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.860]   in our current moment.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:29.460]   In most of our societies, we have decided to treat 18-year-old men and 18-year-old women
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.940]   as competent humans.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.500]   We consider them competent to cast a vote in a democratic election.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:44.780]   We consider them competent to go to war and die, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.740]   We consider them competent to get tattoos, to go through a sex change surgery, to commit
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   crimes and be held fully responsible for their actions and the results of their actions.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.380]   We consider them competent to get themselves euthanized in some countries.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.260]   And we consider them competent to marry.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.940]   Now, of that list of things, and you could expand the list into many other things, but
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:17.500]   of that list, marriage, in my judgment, is probably the least harmful possible decision
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.140]   of any of those things.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:24.620]   Now, the tattooed among us would argue with that and the voters would argue with that,
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.060]   but I think you could extrapolate out and say, "Well, is it really harmless to have
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.460]   a bunch of 18-year-olds voting when they're so easily swayed by whatever?"
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.460]   I don't know.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.980]   The point is that marriage is a relatively – we know that the long-term outcome of
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.500]   marriage is a relatively positive and strong.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.660]   And so, basically what I'm saying is that if we're going to automatically have the
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.420]   response that 18-year-olds shouldn't marry, then they definitely shouldn't do any of
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.660]   the other stuff on that list as well.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.820]   Now, we know from the data that, at least in our current paradigm, that there's a higher
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.700]   rate of divorce for people who marry at 18 as compared to people who marry at 25.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.300]   I don't know why that is the case, but I would say that that's why I'm inclined to agree
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.340]   with the objection.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.460]   I'm not trying to get my own children to marry at 18.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.020]   But I think that we can do a lot more in the direction of solving this.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.700]   First, some of those other things, those other decisions, should be deferred beyond the age
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.980]   of 18.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.900]   If I understand from the medical personnel among us, they say that people's brains – that
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:41.920]   people don't even fully mature from an intellectual or mental standpoint until at least mid-20s.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.020]   And so, I'd like to tell young people, I tell my own children, that if you're going
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:52.420]   to engage in some life-altering decision or behavior, it's probably best to wait until
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.580]   you're something like 30.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.740]   You want to get a tattoo?
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   Get a tattoo.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   But just wait until you're about 30.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.140]   People I've noticed who are happiest with their tattoos are the ones who started when
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:06.540]   they were fully formed adults, not the ones who went out and impetuously made a decision
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.940]   when they were as young as possible.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.860]   I tell my children, if you want to consume alcohol, that's fine.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.540]   Just probably wait until you're 30.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   You make smarter decisions.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.860]   If your decisions are not encumbered by your inebriation, just wait.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.060]   Wait until you can make more mature, intelligent decisions.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   And so, most things in life are better off to defer until a later time.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.100]   And we could argue that that's the case for marriage.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:42.980]   Now, the problem with marriage is that there are certain periods of life in which certain
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.860]   things happen better.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.300]   And I frequently talk about money-bound goals and time-bound goals.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:55.220]   And with marriage, and especially with procreation, younger tends to have better long-term outcomes.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.860]   If you wait until you're 30 to marry, you can still marry well, and you can have children
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.140]   potentially.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.860]   But the statistical likelihood of your marrying your dream partner and/or your having children
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.320]   is much, much lower.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.780]   It's much more likely that most of the dream spouses that you would have loved to be married
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.620]   to are long gone by the age of 30.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.060]   And if you're going to have children, if you start having children at 30 and later, when
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:32.660]   your brain is fully matured and fully formed, then you are going to, number one, not have
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.140]   as much time with those children as you otherwise might have.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.900]   Number two, you are probably going to have a more difficult time conceiving and birthing
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.780]   those children than you otherwise would have.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.220]   And number three, you probably won't be able to have enough time to have as many children
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.380]   as you otherwise would have.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.660]   And so marriage is one of those decisions in where, because we have a biological component
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.500]   of the effect of marriage, we want to be thoughtful about arbitrarily setting a certain age.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:06.980]   And so one of my questions is, how much of this kind of preparation for marriage is cultural
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.220]   as compared to biological?
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:16.220]   I will concede the point that perhaps 18-year-olds are better off having more time for their
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.740]   brains to develop and for them to grow.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.300]   But I also think that we can affect some of these things from a cultural perspective.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.740]   Why aren't our 18-year-olds prepared generally for marriage?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:34.000]   Why would you and I shudder if most 17 or 18 or 19-year-old young men and women came
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.340]   to us and said, "All right, I'm engaged."
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.140]   And we say, "Is that really a good idea?
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.620]   Why would both you and I do that?"
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:49.300]   And could we do a better job of preparing our young people effectively for marriage?
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.320]   I think that cultures throughout history have done so.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.660]   So why can't we, or at least why couldn't we if we wanted to?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:03.020]   Is it the fact that there's some magical age, for example, is 25 the magical age at which
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.300]   it makes sense to marry because then you're going to have the statistically lowest chance
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.020]   of divorce, or is it just that our culture has accomplished certain things that happen
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:19.300]   by and around the age of 25 that winds up in that being a good solution?
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.860]   So I think a good amount of this is a cultural phenomenon.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.980]   And so we could change our culture either on a micro level, our family culture, or on
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.660]   a macro level if we wanted to.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:38.100]   So reasons not to marry young, I've already mentioned maturity, emotional and psychological
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   maturity.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:46.140]   Certainly, some expressions of maturity are biological, but not all.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:52.780]   It's not uncommon for you to encounter a 30 or 40-year-old who, though his chronological
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:58.900]   age has advanced, his psychological and emotional maturity seems stunted for various reasons.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.960]   Sometimes there's been some kind of trauma that has stopped the maturing process.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.220]   Sometimes it's just disuse, nobody was forced to mature.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.220]   And so I think that we could encourage our young people to stronger emotional and psychological
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.960]   maturity before their biological age would indicate that it's possible.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.780]   What about financial stability?
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.060]   One of the great problems of marrying at 18 would be that very rarely would a young man
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.420]   or a young woman have any measurable financial stability.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.260]   But that's something that we've done.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.760]   We've created that system by freezing young people out of the job market, freezing young
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.860]   people, making it illegal for them to work in many cultures prior to that certain age.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.100]   We've created cultures that are very sophisticated and require advanced levels of education and
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.460]   skills and training before someone can be productive.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:52.140]   And so we could go back and think through the educational process that we use and help
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.900]   people to be more prepared at a younger age.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.500]   Youngers can earn money even in a complex society just like anyone else can.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:06.660]   Or education and career development, our training and educational processes could be adjusted
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   if we wanted to.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.100]   What about life experience?
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.260]   I think one of the most powerful ones for many people is just to say that at 18 you
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.300]   don't know yourself because you've had a very constrained life experience.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.220]   A natural way that many people would grow up would be to live in one town where their
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:29.620]   families from, have one life experience of going through a local school system, and their
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.220]   only experience of life comes from what they've learned from vicariously through textbooks
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.880]   or reading or movies or some other thing like that.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.220]   And so the young individual will turn 18 years old, go off to college, and it's basically
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.180]   the first time that that young man or woman has experienced freedom and independence,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.460]   the ability to choose who he or she socializes with and interacts with, and you start to
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.140]   say yes to different kinds of life experience and no to other things.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:03.340]   And it's that process of gaining exposure to varied experiences that often help a young
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.300]   man or woman to form his or her perspectives on life and help him to be more confident
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.900]   in what he likes and what she's not into.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.180]   But why does that life experience have to begin at 18?
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:23.220]   One of my ambitions as a parent is to expose my children very broadly to a diverse experience
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:27.980]   of life at a young age to try to counteract some of these things.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.860]   Seeking the truth never gets old.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.000]   Introducing June's Journey, the free-to-play mobile game that will immerse you in a thrilling
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.260]   murder mystery.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.220]   Join June Parker as she uncovers hidden objects and clues to solve her sister's death in
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.240]   a beautifully illustrated world set in the roaring 20s.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.100]   With new chapters added every week, the excitement never ends.

[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.860]   Games.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:02.660]   And so this is why I travel and why we try to read very broadly and why we try to interact
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.320]   with different cultures and different people and have different situations.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.500]   And then even that experience of going off at 18, I don't think that that should be the
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.940]   first time that young men and women experience freedom and voluntary association.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.700]   I think it's smart for high schoolers to study abroad in high school rather than just waiting
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.700]   until 18.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.820]   I think that teenagers should go and spend their summers working at jobs where they're
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.500]   not at home so they experience the maturing effects and all of the things that come.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.980]   It shouldn't be delayed until 18.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:39.340]   I think that if we do a better job of exposing our young people to diversity of experience
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:46.420]   and diversity of philosophy, then there's probably a stronger possibility that an 18
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.660]   or 20-year-old would feel confident that, "I know who I am.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   I know what I want.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:58.220]   I know what I want to do," and be more ready and more mature with a varied life experience
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.460]   to move into marriage.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.580]   And so there are other factors we could go on.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.000]   My point was just to pique your interest and to say, if you don't believe that 18-year-olds
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.780]   should marry, why don't you believe they should marry?
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:19.660]   And take those factors and say, "Are these things that are biological realities that
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:26.360]   are unalterable, or are these factors things that could be changed if we molded and adapted
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.100]   and reshaped our cultures in some way?"
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.980]   And my answer is that there are a few of those things that fall into Category A, and some
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   also.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.540]   I don't want to create a counterculture that is forced—certainly not one that's forcing—but
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.060]   I don't want to create a culture that's just mindlessly sweeping young men and women into
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.980]   marriage as young as possible, but I want to work hard to create a culture in which
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.800]   there are easy pathways for young men and women to marry when they are young.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.940]   Why is youth such an important component?
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.660]   Why do I care about when young?
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.820]   In addition to all of the factors that I've alluded to and mentioned—things that marriage
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:14.020]   is a transforming influence on young men and people, it has an amazing maturing influence,
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.860]   that when you marry young you have more time with your marriage partner, with your spouse,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.020]   you have more time with your children, everything—when you're younger it's easier to couple up because
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.660]   you're more malleable, you have that less life experience—has a converse benefit in
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.420]   that you can adapt yourself to your spouse in a way that's much harder if you come together
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.780]   when you're both fully formed, mature adults at 32 years old, and you're set in your ways.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.660]   It's easier to be malleable, and that can form a stronger bond.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.140]   And then everything related to children, childbirth, and time with children, all of those things
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.140]   matter.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:57.980]   But the reason I want to emphasize this in today's episode has more to do with your ability
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:05.140]   to find and attract the highest quality spouse, and this is why this is applicable for those
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.680]   of us who are raising children to be thinking about, and it's applicable if you're listening
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.900]   to me and you're 20 years old or 30 years old, 40 years old, 70 years old, and you're
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.580]   unmarried and you're trying to think about, "How do I go about this?
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.580]   I'd like to change this.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.940]   What do I need to do?"
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:27.860]   So the key point is simply, the younger you are when you decide to pursue marriage, the
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:36.780]   better the potential outcome because you have the widest possible pool of high-quality potential
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.580]   mates.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:46.140]   When you are young, you have the widest pool of high-quality potential spouses that you
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:55.060]   will ever, ever have, and I would submit to you that this is a mathematical fact.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.900]   Let me demonstrate it to you.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:05.860]   Let's assume that you are a young man or young woman and you have a sample set of 100 potential
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.060]   spouses that are available to you, that you're exposed to.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.260]   These could be the girls that are in your high school or the boys that are in your college
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.500]   or the co-workers you have or the people you meet at the tennis club or whatever you do
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.860]   or the matches that you get on whatever app you're swiping on at the moment.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.980]   So you have a sample set of 100 persons.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:36.060]   Not all 100 of these individuals are equally appealing to you, and so we could create a
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.380]   grading system of some kind for these individuals.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:46.260]   We could choose and create our grading system for simplicity on a scale of 1 to 10.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.700]   Now let me hasten to add that this is your grading system.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.420]   I'm not saying that, for example, the way this, you know, she's a 10 is commonly used
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.500]   as based upon looks or he's an 8.5.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.440]   This has become somewhat vulgar because I think the factors that people are often using
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.560]   in the grading system are not very well thought out, but the reality is we all have a grading
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   system.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.260]   We all have some kind of system that we grade other people on.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.300]   Whether it's explicitly expressed and we could actually point to it, write it down on a sheet
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.500]   of paper, plug it in a spreadsheet and rate our potential candidates based upon each of
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   the factors that are involved or whether it's just an implicit unexamined attractiveness
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.820]   scale that I'm generally attracted to this person.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:39.360]   We all have a grading scale, and I think that's a good thing.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.140]   If you go through your grading scale and you divide these 100 potential spouses into 10
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.700]   different categories, you would probably get, at the outcome of your grading, you would
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.120]   probably get something like a bell curve.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.760]   And so if we applied the standard numbers to kind of a standard bell curve to this group
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:05.260]   of 100 individuals that you know, again, think of the 100 girls you graduated with from high
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:11.260]   school or college or the last 100 matches you've matched with on your social media app,
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.520]   then of that, at either extreme, you would have a small number.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   Let's say you would have—I'll give you the numbers.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   So on your scale of 1 to 10, you would have 2 people who are rated as 1, very undesirable.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.200]   You would have 5 people that you would rate as a 2.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.840]   You would have 9 people that you would rate as a 3.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.380]   You would have 14 people that you would rate as a 4, 20 people you would rate as a 5, 20
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:40.240]   that you would rate as a 6, 14 as a 7, 9 as an 8, 5 as a 9, and on the very high end of
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.400]   the most attractive desirable people for you, there would be two 10s in that sample set
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.120]   of 100 people.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.560]   Now you have that sample set of 100 people.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.120]   Fast forward one year.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:04.980]   Of that 100 people, at the end of one year, there will be fewer available spouses to you
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.660]   of that sample set of 100 people than there were one year before.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.660]   Why?
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.100]   Well, some people will die perhaps, not many if you're very young, more if you're older,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.300]   but maybe one would die.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:22.040]   Some people will marry, and this would be the most frequent category as to why someone
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.820]   would no longer be available to you as a potential spouse.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:31.280]   Some people would just simply age out, that some people might get too old or too young.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   You would age out.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.480]   You would get older and you would say, "It's not appropriate now for me to be interested
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:42.400]   in someone who was 13 years younger than me or 14 years older than me."
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.880]   Time and life decisions are going to naturally cause many of those 100 people to be unavailable
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.280]   to you.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.140]   Now here's my question.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:03.000]   Of the people, let's say that in a given year, let's say 20 of the 100 people naturally are
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.380]   no longer part of your available sample set.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:12.600]   Are those 20 likely to come from the top half of the curve, the fives and ups, or from the
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.060]   bottom half of the curve, the lower than fives?
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:26.520]   I would say that since the biggest factor in people not being part of your 100-person
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:32.360]   sample set is likely to be that those people are married or in a committed relationship
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:38.180]   leading to marriage or something related to that, that they're probably going to be coming
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.620]   from the most desirable candidates, the fives and over.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:52.140]   Every year what's happening is the best candidates for marriage are quickly becoming fewer and
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.920]   fewer.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.320]   That doesn't necessarily mean that the most beautiful women are no longer available or
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.240]   the most attractive men are no longer available.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:10.960]   Remember, these are your figures, these are your ratings levels, but the best candidates
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.320]   for marriage, if you're interested in marriage, are continually being taken by other people
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:23.600]   who are able to attract those people into a marriage relationship.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:31.320]   If you're not paying attention to this, it's very easy for you to wind up in an unintended
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   place.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.780]   It's very easy for you to wind up older than you ever intended to be and with many fewer
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.400]   marriage candidates.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.240]   You're looking around at the available guys and you're just thinking, "Ah, these guys
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   are all losers."
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.040]   You're looking around at all the girls and you're thinking, "Ah, I don't want to marry
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:55.000]   these girls," and this is a natural, normal part of life.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:05.960]   Now, the answer to this is be as aggressive as possible at a young age about being prepared
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.320]   for marriage and pursue it as a focused goal.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:18.120]   We can't predict exactly when you will meet someone that is an ideal fit for you, but
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.680]   if you are open to meeting that person when you are younger and if you've been intentional
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.560]   about preparing yourself to be able to attract that person when younger, everything will
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.280]   work out.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:37.440]   When you are young, you have the most possible people that you will ever have.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:44.360]   Now, I've talked about the first thing about population, the potential candidate pool of
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.400]   unmarried individuals that you could potentially attract into a marriage relationship being
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.920]   small, but there are other things as well.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:58.520]   Every year that you get older, you might face challenges in being able to attract a partner
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:05.320]   that's of your ideal age and this affects men and women differently.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:14.600]   The traditional normal marriage contract between men and women recognizes a frustrating reality.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:21.800]   Generally speaking, women are the most attractive marriage candidates when they are very young
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:29.240]   because women who are young have the maximum peak of their physical beauty and attractiveness
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:37.880]   and alluring qualities and they have the maximum ability to have babies when young.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:43.360]   As a woman gets older, her physical beauty generally declines and her ability to have
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.440]   babies generally declines.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   Now for men who are younger, their opportunity and ability to provide a warm and comfortable
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.560]   home and provide financially and provide emotional stability and be good fathers, generally when
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:06.040]   a man is young, that ability is only in its infancy.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:10.080]   Twenty-year-old guys are not generally becoming multimillionaires and having all the money
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.200]   to support their wife in FERS and Mercedes and in luxury.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:22.980]   As a man gets older, his ability to provide those things generally increases and so he's
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:28.360]   in his 40s and 50s, it is in his max earning years and he's able to provide those comforts
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.560]   of home.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.760]   And so the normal history of the marriage contract that is one man, one woman for life
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:42.080]   has been wife comes to the table and says, "I will give you my youth, my beauty and my
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.360]   childbearing ability and child raising ability.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.560]   I'll give you these most valuable decades of my life in exchange for you giving me the
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:57.400]   comfort and security and stability during the time when you are the most attractive
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:03.000]   and I'll invest in you when you're young and not particularly attractive so that you stay
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.080]   invested in me when you are older."
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.760]   Well in the marriage environment we've created today in which the marriage contract has been
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:17.520]   weakened and destroyed legally by no fault divorce and culturally with basically saying
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:24.440]   it's no big deal, this has turned into a really bad system for women and for men because women
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:30.680]   don't have the enduring confidence in the marriage relationship and men after now a
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.760]   lot of that and decades of that, men are now realizing, "Wait a second, I can go out and
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.040]   I can attract multiple women who are young and beautiful and raise children for me."
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.440]   And this is an immoral system that we have to end and it's a very frustrating system
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.460]   and it can be frustrating for both people.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:57.640]   The example I think of is there was a friend of mine when I was in school who was incredibly
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.880]   beautiful.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.860]   She was a beautiful girl.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:07.840]   She was physically beautiful, she had a lovely personality, she was very athletic, total
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.680]   class A model, wonderful girl.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.600]   When we were in school, my friends and I, those of us who came from a school where we
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.240]   had a peer group, I remember talking with a friend of mine about what she was doing.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.520]   She was in college and she was dating professional athletes.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.200]   She was dating professional athletes who were current professional athletes who were showering
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.400]   her with money and experiences and everything in the world.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:38.000]   And I remember thinking at the time, "How on earth could I compete with a professional
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   athlete for this beautiful girl, this amazingly attractive young lady?
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   How could I?
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   What could I offer her?
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040]   I couldn't offer her anything.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:51.480]   I was a broke student and, you know, maybe I could have prospects but not the kind of
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.680]   prospects that a professional athlete had and I just thought, "Well, she's just totally
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   out of my league.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.560]   There's nothing that I could offer her."
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:05.120]   But what's interesting is fast forward to today, that girl is now a middle-aged woman
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.880]   and she's a single mother and when I look at her now, I don't have anything near of
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:20.840]   that feeling that I once had of inferiority to her because now as a man, I am coming into
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:29.320]   my prime in many respects of my life and now I feel like I have a lot to offer.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.480]   But now the question would be if I weren't married, well, would she be the one that I
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.240]   would pursue and that's the question that a lot of men face and it's a very frustrating
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.480]   problem for men and women.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:48.840]   And so the best solution to this is to try to be married to somebody who is close in
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:54.040]   age to you because while it's possible to marry outside of your kind of standard age
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:03.680]   range, it creates more and more problems in life and in marriage as that age gap extends.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.360]   And as you get older, the age gap becomes much more important.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.840]   And so if you marry when young, you can marry a very high quality candidate and your age
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:19.520]   gap is together and you start to build a lot of amazing aspects of your life together.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:28.640]   Now and the older you get, the 10s, the 9s, the 8s, the 7s, most of these are taken off
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.640]   of the table.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.000]   They're no longer available to you.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.580]   Remember by the way, for the fourth time, this is your own ranking system.
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:43.000]   If you wanted to create a spousal candidate ranking system that was numeric like this,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.180]   you could do it.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.940]   You would sit down and you would list all of the qualities and characteristics that
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.220]   you consider important in a potential spouse.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.520]   You would create a numeric rating, really the numbers don't matter, but you would create
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.760]   a simple numeric rating, 0 to 10 works fine.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:04.340]   You would say, "Okay, I'm going to rate her physical beauty, 0 to 10, give her X, X number
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.300]   8 points.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.880]   I'm going to rank how I feel when I spend time with her, 8.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.120]   I'm going to rank how much respect she shows to my parents, 3."
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.460]   You create any number of categories you cared about, give them a ranking and you can come
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:26.840]   out the other side with a weighted score based upon how important you characterize things
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:32.100]   are and you could rank a potential wife or a potential husband based upon these scores.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:38.000]   My point is simply that we all have some ranking system and some of us have one or two factors
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.920]   on it, some of us have 102 factors on it, but all of us have a ranking system and if
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.240]   your ranking system is optimized towards marriage, not optimized towards fornication or something
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:47:00.400]   else, then the candidates who would be the best husbands and the best wives, your pool
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.560]   shrinks naturally every year that goes by.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   Now assuming that's true, what you want to do is be serious about marriage but not obsessed.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.120]   Serious but not obsessed.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:24.440]   What I mean by serious is don't set this aside and say, "This is not important to me," because
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:31.080]   if you're having a hard time today finding and attracting a suitable spouse, then it's
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.900]   not going to be easier five years from now.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.460]   There is no metric by which it's easier for that to happen.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:42.560]   The key is to focus on changing whatever needs to be changed to make it easier now and be
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.380]   serious about it.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.920]   And what I often tell people is if you need to spend money on this, this is a good use
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.020]   of money.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.740]   So be serious about it.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:57.380]   One thing that's very different for my being middle-aged as compared to being as young
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.540]   as I once was is that today it's very easy for me to talk about serious things in life
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.800]   in a straightforward manner.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.100]   And I think this is one of the cultural things that we need to change.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:17.700]   Older people, especially older married people, have a generally easy time talking about marriage,
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.580]   pursuing marriage, entering into marriage.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.100]   It's just easy because we understand how important this is in life and how fundamental it is
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.680]   to our experience of life, to our happiness in life and satisfaction and enjoyment.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:37.140]   And so when older people talk to younger people about their romantic relationships, we want
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.300]   young people to win.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.460]   We want young people to experience the joy that we've had.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:46.180]   And we understand that running away from the subject or talking in riddles is not a way
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.600]   of accomplishing that.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:53.860]   For whatever reason, in our youth culture it often doesn't tend to be that way.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.020]   Our parents often didn't facilitate a culture in which talking about matters of the heart
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.860]   was easy with us.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.100]   They often didn't prepare us for what we were going to experience.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.900]   They didn't talk about things seriously and straightforwardly and openly, talk about the
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:13.460]   good and the bad, the benefits, the downsides, the difficulties, the things that are easy.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.340]   And I want to change that.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:21.040]   And so my ambition with all of my children, like one of the things that I never permit
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:30.300]   is I never permit people in personal conversation to make comments that would cause a young
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:38.680]   person, a young man or young woman, to feel weird or funny about experiencing romantic
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.120]   attraction for other people.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.840]   And usually it happens with other fathers and a father will say something about "I want
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.880]   her boyfriends but that's going to be five years off" or "No, that's going to be ten
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.140]   years away" and I always confront this, it's a big deal to me.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:58.260]   Matters of the heart should be normal and appropriate conversations between parents
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.260]   and children.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:03.280]   They are private, they need to be respected and don't ever cause young people to feel
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.140]   bad about it.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:11.320]   And so my ambition as a father is that when my children all experience their first crush,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.120]   I want to be the first one they talk about it.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.040]   When they are totally infatuated with someone, I want to be the first one that knows about
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.460]   it because I've prepared them for that, I've told them it's going to happen, we've talked
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.040]   about it and so when it happens they come to me and they trust me and they know that
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:31.520]   I never betray their confidence and I'm right there to celebrate these experiences they're
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.160]   having, the attraction and to coach them in managing them in an appropriate and healthy
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   way.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.540]   That's my ambition as a father.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.120]   Time will tell whether it works out but that's my ambition as a father.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.760]   And so recognize that we need to deal with these things on a straightforward basis and
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:53.940]   we need to take away the weirdness of the situations in order to improve them.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.100]   How do you attract a high-quality spouse?
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:07.400]   Well I think that it is in a significant way a math equation.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:13.420]   Now that's probably a shocking statement for some people to say that attracting a world-class
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.760]   spouse is a math equation.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:22.960]   I think first we need to deal with our terms and talk about love and marriage being something
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:28.140]   that happens to you rather than something that you do.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:34.920]   In general, I think the idea of finding the one is silly.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:41.600]   It's a riskable concept and it should be mocked mercilessly in our society.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.520]   I don't do very well with the mocking but I think I would be happy if I heard more people
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.640]   mocking the concept of I'm just going to find the one, the one person who is right for me.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.200]   There is no the one.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.400]   In a world of eight billion people there is no just one person in the universe who is
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.080]   right for you.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:05.800]   There are simply people who are a great fit for you when you are ready to marry and then
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.000]   you stop looking.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.860]   So you find someone who is a good fit for you at an appropriate phase of life and then
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.360]   you stop looking.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:18.920]   I don't consider my wife to be the one, as in she's the only one in the world who could
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.840]   possibly be for me.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:29.200]   Rather she is the one because she is the one that I have chosen.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:35.040]   And because of that choice, she is the only one in the world for me.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.360]   Now I understand that sounds like blasphemy in a world formed by Disney princesses and
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.860]   Hallmark movies but it's not.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:50.320]   It is true, it is the truth that we go through life and even if you look at the most ridiculous
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.340]   rom-com that you are aware of, you will see this played out.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:00.700]   You will see that even in a ridiculous movie that is predicated upon finding "the one",
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.540]   you simply have two people that go through life, all of a sudden they encounter one another
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.160]   at a phase in life at which they are open to the relationship.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.400]   Then something clicks, they realize we're a good fit, sometimes that happens quickly
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.040]   and is well judged, sometimes it happens slowly and I just needed this event to happen to
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.680]   convince me that he was the one for me.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.920]   But they realize that this is a good fit and then they get together and then they stop
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.580]   looking.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.480]   Now if you don't stop looking, then you wind up committing adultery against your spouse,
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.760]   you wind up divorced and you wind up going through a long series of relationships.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:42.000]   But your spouse becomes the one when this is the man or the woman that you choose and
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:51.160]   then because of that choice, he or she is the one for you.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.560]   To illustrate this, I thought of the example of athletics.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   I think there are many professional athletes who could effectively compete in various sports.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.960]   If you look at natural athletic ability, it seems to be significantly important to very
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.320]   high level athletic accomplishment.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:17.960]   Is somebody who plays professional football, is his life great because he magically chose
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:24.080]   the right sport for him or is his life great because he worked hard at the sport that he
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.680]   chose?
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:33.380]   I think that if we think about that metaphor, we see analogs in romantic relationships.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:39.180]   We can see, for example, that there are some sports that are good natural complements for
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.960]   certain athletes and some that aren't.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.720]   There are some sports in which you do better if you are very small and there are some sports
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.040]   in which you do better if you are very big.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.960]   There are some sports that you do better at if you're very fat and there are some sports
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.680]   you do better at if you're very skinny.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:01.400]   And so there is a natural component of selection among athletes similar to how there are certain
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.580]   people who just are a good fit and who aren't a good fit for you.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.560]   But then within the group of sports that are a good natural complement for an athlete's
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:16.000]   raw innate characteristics, the athlete becomes great at the sport because he chooses that
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   sport.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.280]   I guess probably the most famous example would be a guy like Deion Sanders.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.500]   Deion Sanders, I think, is the only athlete to date to have played in both a Super Bowl
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:30.480]   and in a World Series, played in the NFL and in Major League Baseball.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:36.280]   But I would say that many athletes who play in the NFL could also play in the NBA and
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:41.000]   many athletes who play baseball could also play football.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Marriage is similar.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   What happened?
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   But why don't they, right?
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.480]   Well, because they picked a sport at a certain point in time and they specialized in it and
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.560]   then that specialization allowed them to achieve the highest levels.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.100]   And marriage is similar.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:56:00.400]   You choose someone who is a good fit for you and then as you build your life together,
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:06.680]   you wind up becoming world class because you have so many shared memories, so many shared
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.440]   relationships, you have a shared vision, you just have a shared life.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:17.320]   So then the idea of anyone else being right for you is unthinkable.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.600]   It's basically unthinkable to me that there would be someone else out there in the world
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:28.560]   who would be a better wife for me because of the shared experience that I have with
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.800]   my wife.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:37.320]   We've had so much of our life together that to not be married to her and to then try to
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:44.480]   build a relationship with someone else, I would be walking away from decades of my own
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.760]   life experience.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.240]   And so that's the point is that you can't, if you have 10 years of experience playing
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.480]   football at a high level, you can't just automatically walk away from that and compete with someone
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:02.560]   who has 10 years of experiencing baseball at a high level.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.240]   The specialization becomes intense.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:11.480]   So recognize that the one is not because you just got to magically find a person in the
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:18.280]   world who is the one for you, but rather that you are going to choose one person from potential
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:24.840]   candidates and then as you enter into and pass through a maturing relationship, then
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:29.260]   that person will be the one because of the choice that you made and become quite literally
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.120]   the only one in the world for you.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.640]   What is the math equation for attracting a spouse?
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.880]   Well, it's not math, but I think it's basically this.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:46.600]   You have to find a suitable, high-quality potential spouse at the right time of your
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:54.560]   life and then successfully woo and attract that person into marriage.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:59.960]   If any of those three things aren't working, then your marriage prospects are dimmed or
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.040]   doomed.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.400]   And so to maximize your marriage prospects, you want to work on all three of these to
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.260]   the best of your abilities.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.260]   What are the three?
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.540]   Again, you have to find a suitable, high-quality potential spouse, find.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:21.000]   That is a whole process of the potential candidates that are available, your interaction with
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.720]   those candidates and the screening ability that you have to find a suitable, high-quality
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:30.800]   potential spouse at the right time of your life.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.080]   What is the right time of your life?
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.200]   Well, you decide, but it's an important component and many people say, "Well, it's not the right
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.080]   time right now and it's not the right time because it's going to be eight more years
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.560]   because I'm going to build my career or four more years because I'm going to graduate from
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:50.960]   college or whatever the right time is," but then your candidate pool becomes smaller.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.440]   And so I'm pleading with you to not ignore the importance of age and be open to it at
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:02.080]   many times in life while also acknowledging that sometimes you got to do certain things
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.600]   and make changes and change takes time.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.040]   So you have to find a suitable, high-quality potential spouse at the right time of life
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.880]   and then successfully woo and attract him or her into marriage.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:19.100]   You have to be attractive enough to the person that you want to be attracted to you in order
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:23.940]   to actually engage in a relationship that leads to marriage.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.460]   Notice my emphasis on engage in a relationship that leads to marriage.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.860]   That's hard to do.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:35.280]   There's a wide pool of candidates of people that you could be friends with.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.040]   There's a smaller pool of candidates of people that you could have some kind of romantic-ish
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.600]   relationship or situationship with.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:50.100]   There's a wide pool of people that you could have a sexual relationship with.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:56.840]   But to attract someone into a marriage relationship and then actually see it through to consummation
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:03.120]   is a different proposition and it requires a different approach.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.880]   So you should be careful in this who you take advice from.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:13.520]   One of the things that I find interesting as a cultural observer is how few people there
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:20.880]   are who are happily and successfully married who are talking about how they accomplished
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.680]   that.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.520]   What I'm doing at the moment is a little unusual.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:37.640]   There's a world of dating coaches available to you who will teach you how to date.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:45.380]   There aren't so many people who are in long-term enduring relationships who are trying to teach
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.680]   you how to build a long-term enduring relationships.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.120]   Most of us who are in that situation, it's just not important to us.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.520]   I don't want to go and do that.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.320]   So I'm doing my best because I care about it.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.080]   But recognize that if you want to know how to get married, you should spend your time
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.360]   asking married people how that happened for them.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.800]   If you're a young man and you want to get married, you should spend more time with married
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.760]   men as compared to single men and find out what those married men did.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.360]   If you're a young woman and you want to spend time with married women and find out how did
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   this happen, what did you do, what advice do you have for someone like me?
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.920]   And notice, by the way, that our society is generally structured in a way to make that
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   difficult.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.080]   So you've got a church and you have the singles groups and the married groups.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.120]   But if you're single and you want to be in the married group, you need to spend time
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.560]   in the single group because that's possibly where your potential spouse might be, but
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.360]   you need to get the advice from the married group.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.000]   So you've got to create it for yourself.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.800]   Here is my advice for you if you want to follow this through.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.160]   Assume that today you're listening to me and you're saying, "Joshua, I'm single.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.400]   I would like to get married.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.280]   What can I do?"
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.200]   Here is my advice.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:12.000]   Step one, I want you to create a comprehensive image of what you would consider to be someone
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.520]   that would be your dream spouse.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.080]   If you're a man and you're sitting there and you're thinking, I want you to create in your
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:27.720]   mind a picture of the perfect woman that you would run down the aisle to marry with zero
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.980]   reservations, zero hesitation, no holding back whatsoever.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.160]   I want you to picture her in your mind.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.560]   Now, picturing her is not enough.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:46.040]   What we need to do is we need to get that picture out of your mind and onto paper where
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.520]   we can analyze it.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.120]   You do this in whatever way is comfortable for you.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.200]   Take out a sheet of paper in your journal and write, "My perfect wife" at the top of
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.560]   it.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.120]   Pull out a note on your phone and title it, "My perfect wife."
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:06.480]   If you're a lady, sit down and record a voice memo and say, "My perfect husband."
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   Make it out.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.240]   You're going to transcribe it.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.320]   Some way of getting this on paper.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:21.280]   Then I want you to spend time writing down every feature, characteristic, quality, attribute.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:27.600]   Write down everything that you can think of that you would dream about of the perfect
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.120]   man or woman for me.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.920]   Again, put yourself in a mental frame in which you would experience zero hesitation to move
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.640]   towards marriage.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.840]   Get a crystal clear picture as much as is possible of every attribute, feature, characteristic,
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.440]   quality, everything related to this person.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.880]   Do not censor yourself in any way.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.920]   What I mean is all of us live under social obligations and we experience some form of
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.220]   censorship.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.440]   We all would censor our words.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:09.480]   We would provide some kind of characteristic of disclaimers or whatever if we actually
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.040]   expressed what we really wanted.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.480]   The censorship that we would generally apply to our words applies also to our thoughts
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   because when we've experienced the social pressure that we all experience, even in our
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.880]   own thoughts, we're always censoring ourselves and saying, "Well, I want this but I shouldn't
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.120]   want that," or, "It's just not right for me."
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.160]   I'm going to encourage you, do not censor yourself at all.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.480]   If this should be your thing, put it in lock and key, put it in an encrypted note.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.360]   No one else is ever going to read this thing.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:48.680]   You write down every characteristic that you want, every dream that you have of an absolute
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.800]   10 out of 10, an absolute dream spouse for you.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.840]   Take multiple days, multiple weeks.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.880]   Takes as long as you want.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.240]   Make it a running list.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:05.440]   Anytime you observe someone, let's say you're over at dinner at a friend's house and you
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.080]   observe his wife doing something, write that down.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.000]   I have this video I show to people of this couple that I randomly found, and I just was
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.960]   amazed at how the woman looked at the husband while they're recording the video.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.080]   I thought, "That's something that I never would have thought of writing down.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.500]   She looks at me a certain way when recording a video," but you can just see that expression
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.560]   of the way that woman looks at her husband.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.960]   It's amazing.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.680]   Write down every feature, attribute, everything you can imagine and make a comprehensive list.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.600]   Make it as long as possible and don't censor yourself or judge yourself or criticize yourself
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.640]   on any of these things at this stage.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.920]   That's step one.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.040]   Now, set that list aside.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:55.040]   Let it percolate for an appropriate amount of time, days, couple of weeks, whatever.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:02.160]   Then bring out that list and read it carefully.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.920]   Print it out, put it on your desk, read it carefully.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.160]   And then you're going to make another list.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:15.360]   Say while you're imagining this perfect person, I'm going to use a man's example, you're imagining
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.340]   your perfect wife.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:22.320]   Put that list of all the characteristics and attributes that she has on one sheet of paper.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:29.000]   Put the second sheet of paper and say, "I'm going to now describe the perfect man that
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.320]   this perfect woman would be attracted to."
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:41.640]   So for every feature or attribute or characteristic, quality that you described about your perfect
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.560]   wife, she's going to have a corresponding character, feature, or attribute that would
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.760]   correspond to what you wrote down.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.720]   You wrote down that my ideal wife is a woman who is honest.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720]   She's honest.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.600]   Well, is she going to be attracted to somebody who is dishonest?
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   No.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.880]   So you write honest.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.360]   Let's say that she's physically beautiful, she dresses well, she looks stunning at all
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360]   times.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.120]   Well, is a woman who dresses well and is very physically beautiful?
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.400]   Is she likely to be attracted to somebody who dresses like a slob?
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.760]   Probably not.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.000]   So you would say, you know, dresses well, dresses suitably.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.040]   And there is texture that is necessary in this, because most relationships that are
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:41.720]   successful involve a man and a woman who complement one another.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.920]   The word "complement" does not mean are the same as one another.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:50.200]   And so if she dresses like a prima donna at all times, just absolutely and totally into
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.000]   fashion, does that mean that she's automatically into the guy who dresses like a dandy at all
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   times?
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.240]   My answer would be no, she's not necessarily.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.320]   Now sometimes you see those kinds of couples and they seem to get along together, but there
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:08.120]   is a range of appropriateness that if she cares about the way that she dresses, then
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:14.080]   at the very least a man that she's likely to be attracted to is presentable and is not
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.280]   completely thoughtless.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.480]   And so you figure out what the range is for each characteristic.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.160]   You know, let's say that you wrote down someone who's very intelligent.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.240]   Well, is she likely to be attracted to somebody who's not intelligent?
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.720]   Write down all of the attributes of it.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.920]   Picture this woman and write down the perfect man that she would be attracted to.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.680]   Similarly, if you're a woman and you're doing this exercise, you wrote down the perfect
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.040]   man, write down all of the attributes of the perfect wife that he would just be thrilled
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.280]   to marry from everything that you know, you've observed, you've heard about, you've learned
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.240]   about, you've asked other people about.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   That's step two.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.360]   Take as much time as necessary, days, weeks, months, doesn't matter, just take time and
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.440]   get a clear clarity on it.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.960]   But hopefully this is days and weeks.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.280]   Then come back to that list, give it a short time, days or weeks, come back to that list
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.920]   number two.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.020]   And now here's the hard part.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:21.160]   You need to grade yourself on how well you match up to that perfect person.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.120]   So again, using a man's perspective, I made list A was my perfect wife.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.520]   Every feature attribute I could do.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.200]   List B was the kind of man that this woman is likely to be attracted to.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.400]   What kind of man would she run down the aisle to meet?
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.040]   And now I'm going to grade myself on those things.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.000]   Zero to ten works fine.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   You say, well, she's going to be attracted to someone who's, you know, I wrote down that
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.360]   she's beautiful and athletic and we like to do runs together.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.560]   And so she's going to be attracted to someone who's beautiful and athletic, great.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.640]   So I'm a ten out of ten out of ten.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.960]   Then, you know, she's going to be attracted to someone who has a lot of money so that
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.780]   he can provide for her.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.160]   But I'm flat broke, so I'm one out of ten.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.760]   Or she's going to be attracted to somebody who has good social skills and is able to
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.080]   interact with her in a positive way or makes her feel good and whatever the things are
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.080]   that you wrote.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.320]   I just, I don't have those skills.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.760]   And you grade yourself and compare yourself to that perfect man as best you can imagine
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.040]   him to be.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.520]   You now have your to-do list, your self-improvement list.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.400]   After I finish this line of thinking that I'm going down, I'll come back and give you
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.320]   some suggestions for what should be on that list if you yourself can't come up with that
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   list.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.120]   But I don't want to do that here because I want to emphasize this is your list.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.320]   These are the things that you can change about yourself and you get started on changing those
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.760]   things.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.120]   And there's no reason to wait.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.280]   Get started on changing those things.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.480]   You can't coerce someone into a marriage with you.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.160]   You have to attract a person into a marriage with you.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.040]   You can't guarantee for certain what is likely to attract a specific person.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.760]   We all have strange and unusual things that for us are individual.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:21.120]   But you can start to create an appropriate level of commonality by imagining what you
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:28.600]   think is your ideal marriage partner and then by starting to become what you think would
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.320]   be the ideal marriage partner for that person.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.840]   And so while the individual expressions on a very small level will be very negotiable,
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.480]   the big things aren't.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.100]   Just a goofy example.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.180]   I drink coffee.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.800]   My wife doesn't drink coffee ever.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   She doesn't like it.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   Never has.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   Never will.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800]   My wife drinks tea.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.760]   Okay, I'm fine with drinking tea.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.320]   You could sit down and you could say, "Oh, the ideal woman that I would want to be in
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:01.880]   a relationship with would be – would match me for my interest in coffee.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.000]   And so I'm going to become super" – whatever the expression of it.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.120]   The point is that this is a minor unimportant thing.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:14.100]   It just doesn't matter at all whether someone likes coffee or doesn't like coffee or shares
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.320]   your taste in wines or doesn't share your taste in wines.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.680]   What is a big deal is wants to have children, doesn't want to have children.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.880]   Things like that are non-negotiable, like non-starters.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.820]   You can't – that has to be key.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:32.600]   And so you will ultimately rank these things and a lot of this will just work out in the
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.480]   wash and you'll say, "Oh, I put down that she must like coffee but after all, here's
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.160]   this great girl that doesn't like coffee.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.400]   No big deal."
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.440]   But you want to start moving yourself in the direction of being someone who's likely to
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.800]   be attractive to the kind of person that you want to attract.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.400]   I'm not going to dictate these things to you and no one else should either.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:13:00.480]   But the person that you are in reality should attract the kind of person that you want to
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.360]   be with and repel the kind of people that you don't want to be with.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.400]   And you can do that by making a list, number one, of your ideal spouse.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.000]   Number two, making a fantasy list of the kind of person that your ideal spouse is likely
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.160]   to be attracted to and then measuring yourself as compared to that person that you've made
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.160]   up and saying, "What do I need to change?" and then get busy changing it.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.200]   Now after you've done that and while you are busy changing it, the next thing that
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.520]   you want to do is go back to that image you've created, the avatar you've created of your
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.920]   perfect wife or your perfect husband, and then make another list.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:51.740]   And the list is, "Where is this person likely to be?"
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.640]   Seeking the truth never gets old.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.840]   Introducing June's Journey, the free-to-play mobile game that will immerse you in a thrilling
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.360]   murder mystery.

[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.600]   games.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:28.080]   Where does this person spend time?
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.520]   If you wrote, "I want someone who is Christian like me," then there's a bigger chance
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.600]   that she's in church on Sunday morning than at the club on Saturday night.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.440]   If you wrote down, "I want someone who is athletic," there's a bigger chance that
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:52.120]   she's in the hiking club that is going out on Saturday morning than in the chess club.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:57.480]   If you wrote, "I want someone who is intelligent," there's a bigger chance that she is in college
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.960]   than that she's working in a factory.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.560]   You get the point.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560]   Where is this person?
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.040]   And here I think you should also consider what online communities is this person a part
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040]   of.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:16.560]   There's going to be a difference between, I don't know, meetmyhusband.com versus Tinder.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.720]   There's going to be a big difference in different apps and different platforms that people are
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   likely to be.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.640]   And so you need to ask yourself, where is this person likely to be?
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.520]   Then next step is go back to your calendar.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.680]   After you've made the list of where is this person, go back to your calendar and count
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:45.200]   up the number of times in the last month that you have actually been in the place that your
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:52.040]   ideal husband or wife is or could be found.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:57.600]   There are a couple of things that can go wrong in the process of finding and attracting a
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.800]   suitable spouse, and we can analyze these things under those three layers that I said.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.280]   What is the equation for attracting a spouse?
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.120]   You have to find a suitable high-quality potential spouse at the right time of life and successfully
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.540]   woo and attract him or her into marriage.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:18.700]   So we've spent some time on successfully wooing and attracting him or her into marriage.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:23.260]   We've talked about becoming the kind of person that would be attractive to this spouse.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.520]   We've talked a little bit about the right time of life.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.480]   If you're 15 years old and you want to get married, there aren't that many people in
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.280]   your high school classroom that want to get married, not the right time of life.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.440]   So we're going to be at the right time of life.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.640]   But then you have to find the suitable spouse.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.440]   And so you say, well, where's the problem?
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.960]   Is the problem that I'm not attractive or is the problem that I'm just not spending
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.740]   any time finding and I'm not spending time looking?
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.960]   And a lot of people that I interact with tell me, Joshua, I want to get married.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.320]   If I ask you the question, how many potential candidates did you meet in the last month?
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.800]   The answer is zero.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.080]   So we don't need to automatically assume that the problem is because you're unattractive.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.520]   Maybe the problem is that you're just not actually meeting anybody.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.200]   And this is understandable, by the way.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.400]   No one would find fault with you.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   You're frustrated.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.800]   You had a bad breakup.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.560]   You're annoyed with not getting matched online or whatever it is.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.580]   That's all understandable.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.000]   But understandable doesn't mean that you're actually going to get the outcome if it doesn't
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   happen.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.760]   There's a lot of people that go through life expecting that magically someday the wonderful
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.160]   girl from heaven is going to knock on the front door and propose to me on the doorstep
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.240]   never having met me.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.640]   And it's absurd.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.200]   It's an absurd concept.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.700]   And we need to recognize it's absurd and then change it.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:45.680]   So if you're working on your personal attractiveness and you're at the right time of life in which
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.840]   you want to marry, then you need to be out meeting potential candidates.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.800]   You need to be meeting people.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.900]   And then we can try to figure out what's working and what's not working.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.020]   And so how many times in the last month have you been in these places where your ideal
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.600]   spouse is?
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.720]   How many available women have you met?
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.040]   Or how many available men have you met?
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.160]   Or how many available attractive men and women have you met?
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.760]   People that you think are appropriate for you based upon your values and your list,
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.040]   have you met?
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.840]   And if the answer is two in the last six months, the chances of you being married two years
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.600]   from now are very low.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.320]   On the other hand, if the answer is 10 in the last six weeks, then now we've got pretty
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.320]   good odds.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.360]   And we can go back and we can analyze those numbers and say, "Well, what's going well?
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.180]   What's not going well?"
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:42.520]   And this is where you could be coached further with appropriate texture.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.400]   If you're a guy, I met 10 women who were unmarried, seemed like the kind of people that I would
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:53.640]   be interested in getting to know and dating to see if there would be a relationship there.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.880]   I asked 10 women out and all 10 said no.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.880]   All right.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.480]   Well, something's wrong.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.460]   Why did 10 out of 10 say no to you?
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.280]   And are you a weirdo?
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.760]   Do you come across as obsessive?
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.380]   Again, serious, not obsessed.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   We don't want to be a weirdo.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:11.240]   We don't want to pull off bad vibes.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:15.100]   Are you – and I'm not going to go down, but you can analyze it.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:21.000]   What you can't do necessarily is have any luck if someone says, "I've met zero women
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.840]   in the last six weeks and I don't care."
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.200]   Well, you're not going to be married six years from now if you don't change that.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.320]   So you need to change, number one, who you are, if there's something unattractive about
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.840]   who you are, to your ideal spouse.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.160]   Number two, you need to change where you are and be spending time in places where your
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.300]   potential candidates are likely to be.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.000]   Remember the saying, "What gets measured gets managed."
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.480]   If you can see that something – that if you did something, that that could likely
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.280]   lead to better outcomes for a goal that you are seeking.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.800]   And if it's something that you're capable of measuring, then it's something that you
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.280]   should measure so that you could manage it.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:10.120]   And measuring yourself against the attributes that you think your perfect potential spouse
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.160]   would value in you so that you can manage them is good.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:19.720]   And then measuring the number of potential candidates that you meet through your activities
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:26.160]   and through what you're doing in life, that's also something that could lead to the initiation
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.080]   of a relationship.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.960]   Not everything is math, but you can develop the skills that are necessary.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.360]   And if you can measure these things, then you can coach yourself into what skills do
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.560]   you need to do.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   You may need to develop social skills of meeting people, striking up a conversation, asking
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   someone out.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.680]   You may need to develop social skills of creating an intimate communication in relationship.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.900]   You need – there's all kinds of skills, but all of these are projects.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.280]   These are things that can be done.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:01.560]   And there is no person in the world who with time, practice, focus, a little bit of outside
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.840]   analysis and good coaching and focus on skill set development can't develop all of the
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:13.720]   skills necessary to initiate a successful romantic relationship, lead it into and through
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.800]   marriage, found a family.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.840]   All of those things are totally possible.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:24.040]   So regardless of whether it's as easy as it once was or not, it is possible and it
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.520]   can be done and it can be done by any person.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.400]   There are certain factors that make it naturally easier and you may or may not have those factors,
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.080]   but it doesn't matter.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.780]   You have the factors that you have and you should focus on moving them forward.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:46.880]   By way of review, what I suggest, step one, make a list of your perfect ideal spouse and
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.600]   all of her characteristics, attributes, qualities, features, everything.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:59.720]   Number two, make a list of the kind of person that your ideal spouse would likely be attracted
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:05.440]   to, everything that you can think of, especially based upon what you described as important.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:12.440]   Number three, compare yourself as objectively as possible to that ideal man or ideal person
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.040]   and figure out where your strengths are and where your weaknesses are and work on your
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.180]   weaknesses as best you are able to.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:29.860]   Number four, make a list of where your ideal spouse spends time and is in this moment and
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:36.060]   then ask yourself, how much time am I actually spending in that place?
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:44.380]   Then track the number of potential candidates that you are meeting by being in that place
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:48.060]   and then track the results of what happens.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.220]   An example that is really good for younger people, especially I want to speak to younger
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.660]   men for a moment.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:59.960]   If you are a younger man, there is a very high probability that the woman that you would
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:06.580]   consider to be a dream wife is in a college somewhere.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:12.340]   In our current environment, most intelligent, capable, hardworking women are going to go
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.780]   to college.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:18.740]   Women are going to college at a rate twice as high as men and they are likely to be in
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.020]   college.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:25.260]   You can filter colleges based upon ideology.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:28.780]   Many colleges will attract certain kinds of people and repel certain kinds of people.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:33.060]   If there is a certain type of woman that you are looking for, she is probably going to
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.540]   be in a certain college.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:40.340]   The best thing to do, especially when you are young, is probably to be in that kind
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.900]   of environment.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:47.420]   I don't want to focus on a long discourse of this, but this is important because remember
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.340]   back to phases of life.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:56.100]   If you are 18, 20, 22 years old, 24 years old, 27 years old, it is relatively easy for
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:03.580]   you to be in college and for you to naturally interact with dozens and dozens and dozens
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.860]   of people who might be a high quality spouse for you.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.460]   On the other hand, if you are 40 years old, it is much more difficult for you to be in
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.380]   that environment.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.820]   So this is one of the things that timing matters.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:19.260]   So my point of spending time in it is one of the strategies that I think is a good strategy
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.660]   for people to consider, especially for men who often have a very difficult time with
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:28.900]   online dating, is how can you get yourself into an appropriate college environment.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:33.420]   Go ahead and take a master's degree, work out at the on-campus gym, make sure you have
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.100]   a legitimate non-creepy reason to be in the college environment and then meet lots of
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:39.100]   people.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:46.140]   It's relatively easy as a guy to meet a dozen new girls per week around the college environment,
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:50.220]   whereas if you're 35 years old and you're working 70 hours a week, it's much more difficult
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:57.220]   for you to meet a dozen new girls per week without some other elaborate system of introductions.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:03.620]   So go through this process and check yourself, meaning rate yourself, track how many people
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.140]   did I meet, what happened in those conversations.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:12.540]   I met a girl at the gym, we had a short conversation, it was pleasant, it was great, but here's
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.700]   what happened and then see what is happening in terms of moving the relationship forward.
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:23.980]   That's the process that is useful and if you go through that process, probably by now,
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:28.460]   even in your mind, you automatically know some things that you could or would change
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.540]   that might help you get a better outcome of a potential spouse.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:39.340]   I would love it if you would stop now and do those exercises before you hear what I'm
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.340]   about to say.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.140]   Let me tell you what I'm about to say so that you can stop if it would be appropriate.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:48.740]   I'm going to give you some specifics that are broadly applicable, specifics for men
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:54.300]   and specifics for women, that are things that will help you to be generally more attractive
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.400]   and I'm doing this because this is what I wish that I had had when I was younger.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.900]   When I was younger, I was not serious about finding a wife, just happened because I ended
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:09.660]   up in the natural environment and I met a woman that I clicked with and it happens naturally.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:15.980]   That's what happens for most people and what happened in the past, but I didn't come from
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:19.420]   a culture that was as broken around dating as the current culture and so I didn't need
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.820]   this strong plan.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:26.380]   The current dating culture is increasingly broken and it's broken a lot since I was in
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.460]   college.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.500]   It's gotten much more difficult for young men and women and that's why I'm spending
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:37.060]   more time on it, but I wish still in hindsight I look back and I think why didn't somebody
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:43.660]   tell me how important some of these factors were and so I try to do my job to coach young
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:49.380]   men and young women on some of the factors that while not any one of them is the factor,
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:56.020]   it's the collection of these traits and features that are probably going to influence the outcomes
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:03.900]   that you have and when I interact with people who are not successful with women or not successful
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:12.420]   with men, it's rare to find people who are maximizing these characteristics and attributes
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.980]   that are having that level of success.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.620]   I want you to listen to what I'm going to continue on with, but I would love it if you
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:20.220]   would make your own lists first.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.620]   So if you're going to do this exercise, you're the kind of person who does it, pause the
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:29.100]   episode, go through, spend the next three or four weeks doing these exercises that I've
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:34.460]   described for you and then come back and listen to what I'm about to say.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.420]   If you're the kind of person who never stops when someone says stop, then just listen,
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:42.580]   but just know that I'm going to probably pollute your mind a little bit with giving you attributes
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:50.080]   and characteristics that are broadly influential on most male and female relationships.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:59.460]   Listening now so you can stop the episode, five, four, three, two, one.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:03.780]   I'm going to give you a list of characteristics and what I'm going to share with you is not
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.420]   original with me.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:13.260]   It comes from an awkwardly titled YouTube channel called Ho Math.
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:20.540]   Ho Math has become a very large producer on TikTok and on YouTube and is increasingly
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.540]   growing.
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:28.940]   And back around last year in December, which is actually when the video that I'm referencing
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:35.680]   and drawing from came out, I came across this channel and I immediately saw that this particular
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:43.560]   channel in our current moment is an extremely useful and somewhat balanced perspective on
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.480]   relationship formation in the current world.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.200]   If you're looking for coaches or guides on relationship formation, we face an enormous
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   problem.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.360]   And let me describe the problem to you so that you can understand where to go for advice.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:05.080]   The first problem is that the dating marketplace, the sexual marketplace for young people who
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:12.820]   are dating has been completely transformed in the last decade for a variety of features.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:17.760]   And so many older people, my generation and older, who are not paying attention, they
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:23.920]   don't understand how much things have changed, genuinely changed.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.240]   There are many reasons for this, but just something as simple as social media has completely
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.480]   transformed male and female relationships from being kind of a natural thing where you
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.760]   interacted with people who were in your social sphere to now young men and women are accessing
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.520]   people from all around the world.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.160]   In former times, it was very normal that you went to high school, you went to college,
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.200]   you had your social circle was limited by those you were in high school with and those
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:00.520]   you were in college with, and that the people that you interacted with were drawn from that
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.920]   limited social circle.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.440]   Well, today that's entirely different.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:11.480]   Today, any man and most importantly any woman can go online, create a profile, and instantly
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   – generally the women – receive male attention from people all around the world.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:23.160]   And so this has dramatically changed relationship dynamics for young men and women that now
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.520]   as a young man you're not just in competition with the people in your high school class
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.040]   or your college environment, you're now in competition with people from all around
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.800]   the world at all different ages.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.760]   And so this has changed the dynamics.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:43.680]   Older people generally, unless they're paying attention and asking young people for their
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.200]   experience, don't have an accurate view of where things are at the moment.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:53.880]   The next thing that you have to filter for is basically ideology or philosophy.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:00.720]   We are becoming a more segregated society where people of an intense ideology are congregating
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.760]   together.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.720]   And so you can have this for men and for women.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.100]   I'm most familiar with the male space.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:13.160]   But let's say that I become a red-pilled, in-cell MGTOW guy.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:18.080]   And so I spend all my time consuming MGTOW, which is an acronym MGTOW, men going their
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.200]   own way.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.800]   And I'm spending all my time with the red-pilled MGTOW folks.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.440]   And that's all I listen to.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:26.240]   I can do this when I'm young, I can do this when I'm older.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:31.400]   Usually with the younger guys it winds up being the pickup artist space and basically
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.000]   the sleep with as many women as possible and abuse them space.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.100]   Andrew Tate and many people in his sphere would be emblematic of this.
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:47.320]   If you're an older guy then it becomes the divorced folks, it becomes the entrepreneurs
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   and cars people and all of the 40s and 50-year-old guys.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:55.600]   And what happens is you get into this echo chamber, so you watch one video and the algorithm
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.240]   feeds you another video.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.880]   And six months later you basically despise women and you just despise women and you become
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:09.760]   totally toxic to women because of your misogynistic despising of women.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.200]   And you look at some of the people who talk about this, it just becomes a self-reinforcing
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.200]   expression of it.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.800]   Whereas meanwhile guys who are happily married and appreciate women, they tend to be pretty
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.440]   attractive to women because they appreciate women and they don't just look down on women.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:31.280]   And I'm sure that there's a similar effect in female circles where I'm generally pretty
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.500]   repulsed by like hardcore pink-haired feminist types.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.800]   And it's fine, they want to repulse me, they want to repel me and so I'm repulsed by them.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:47.400]   But what happens is that they're not receiving energy from people like me who I consider
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:54.240]   myself a fairly upstanding, virtuous man of integrity who appreciates and who is respectful
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   of women.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:01.320]   And I have opinions and ideas that she might disagree with, but I treat women with respect
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.540]   in all circumstances.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:09.360]   And so she's repelling guys like me, but then she's going to create a sphere group of guys
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.920]   who don't have that perspective to her and who would mistreat her.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:19.320]   And so it's no surprise that two or three years later she winds up hating men because
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   of this.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   After all, that's what she's been exposed to.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.760]   I watched this happen to a friend of mine that I graduated from, a friend of mine from
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:36.080]   school, moved to New York, wound up in kind of this super ambitious culture that was very
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.440]   unfriendly to marriage and kind of just natural relationships.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:46.700]   Today she's a blue-haired lesbian, feminist type, and it's a totally natural thing.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.000]   But she wasn't that way.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.700]   There was nothing innate about her that was that way.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.680]   It was that the culture that she got involved in changed her, and so we want to be careful
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   of cultural influences.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.040]   And today, since we all choose our cultural voices to a degree based upon who we choose
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.960]   to pay attention to, it's really important that we develop filtering mechanisms for people
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.920]   that have a balance, and an appreciation, a knowledge, and a balance.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.040]   I say all that to say that I think Homath, as much as I don't like saying the name of
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.480]   his channel and his platform, is one of those guys who's probably a useful and insightful
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.700]   observer because of his own experience and because of what he's done.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:33.580]   So he published this video back in December of 2023 called Zones Version 3, The Most Useful
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.020]   Relationship Map in History.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.360]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:44.880]   And in this, he goes over a diagram that he drew that I think is broadly useful to understand
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.500]   male and female attraction.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:52.460]   It's not—when I say—you're smart enough to understand words like broadly, like broadly
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.340]   this is useful.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:00.340]   And because it's broadly useful, I consider it an important thing to discuss.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:01.540]   You can watch the original version.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.420]   I would encourage you to watch the original version.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:09.060]   I'm just going to go over some of the factors that you might want to consider in terms of
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:15.020]   assessing why am I unable to attract the kind of person that I want to attract.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   And these factors are different for men and for women.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:28.100]   I'm going to begin with what men are attracted to in women because they are somewhat simpler.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:35.580]   When I say simpler, one of the insights that I think is useful from this particular relationship
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:44.860]   map is the introduction of texture to say that men analyze women differently than women
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.420]   analyze men.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:53.180]   From my experience and observation, I think this is true.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:36:00.380]   For the kind of woman that a man is attracted to, men basically have one scale.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:04.180]   We can label it as 0 to 10.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:13.860]   And in the actual video, HOMATH goes through different levels as far as the kinds of relationships
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:17.020]   that men will engage in with women.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:20.660]   As someone who is mostly interested in marriage, I understand we need to be aware of this,
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:25.980]   but I'm mostly interested in helping people to get to marriage, not to just multiple relationships.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:32.220]   But the point is that men could rate women and do rate women on a scale of 0 to 10 on
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:38.620]   a single scale and that the features in this scale are additive.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:42.060]   Men have one meter to say, "Are you a keeper?
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:47.260]   Are you a seven and over that I'm going to commit to or are you not?"
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:53.900]   And if you're going to be a 10, it's the accumulation of these features.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:37:01.580]   Now, going from most important to least important for men, we can factor these in.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.780]   So according to HOMATH's chart, he would say that the most important thing for men where
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.980]   you get the most points is your body, is a woman's body.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.300]   And so a body would include factors such as body type.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:18.780]   She has a body type that I'm attracted to, her voice, how does she speak, fitness, level
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:25.780]   of personal fitness, the attractiveness of her face, her hair, pheromones or just a general
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:28.100]   sense and chemistry.
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.260]   Then you have personality.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:37.060]   Generally men are attracted to women who are supportive, who are helpful, who are reliable,
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:43.180]   women who are interesting, who are talented, who are fun to be with, who have a high IQ,
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:48.580]   who are intelligent and who are emotional bonding.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:51.740]   Then you have the factors related to purity.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.380]   So is she a woman who is loyal to me?
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:57.880]   What is her history with men, her sexual history?
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.360]   What baggage does she bring to the table of her life?
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360]   Is she modest?
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.080]   Does she express modesty?
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.420]   Is she innocent?
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.580]   Is she willing to be exclusive with me?
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.260]   Does she want children?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.140]   Does she have a lot of guy "friends" that she indulges in her life?
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:19.700]   And then small factors that barely matter at all to men such as there's certain conveniences
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.580]   or possessions or quirks about her.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.620]   And the idea is that these things are cumulative.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:30.820]   Not any one factor is something that is going to be the factor.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:35.420]   But for a man, if he looks at the overall package and says, "Okay, she's got a body
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.260]   type that I'm attracted to.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.340]   She's in good shape.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.880]   We seem to have good chemistry.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.480]   She's got hair I like.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.060]   Maybe her face is not naturally the most beautiful, but it's acceptable.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.180]   She's super supportive.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.220]   She makes me feel strong and confident in myself.
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.780]   She's really fun to be around.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.140]   She's loyal to me.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.660]   She doesn't have a lot of baggage.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:55.660]   She's generally modest.
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.660]   She treats me well.
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:57.660]   She wants children."
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.140]   A man says, "She's great.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.140]   I'm going to marry her."
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.420]   It's one dimension that is cumulative.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.120]   So if you're a woman who is looking to attract a man, I would encourage you go through that
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.360]   list that I just read to you and look through the list and ask yourself, "How can I optimize
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.100]   each of these things?"
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.860]   And men will tell you if you ask them.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.220]   The problem that many young women who desire to marry today is that they're optimizing
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.580]   for things that men don't value.
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:29.220]   They're optimizing for things that society is optimizing for men, and men are not generally
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.220]   attracted to men.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.060]   They're attracted to women.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.540]   And so this is why, if you're a woman and you're in good shape and you are encouraging
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:42.380]   to a man and you build his confidence and you're supportive of him and you wear a cute
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:48.620]   dress and you cook a great meal, good chance that he's seeing you as wife material.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:53.500]   And he's not so impressed by the fact that you're the president of the XYZ Society and
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.980]   that you've written four books and published those things, because those things are not
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.780]   that big a deal to him.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780]   They're not unimportant.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:03.380]   They're an expression of your IQ and your talent and things like that, but they're not
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.700]   that important.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.660]   So consider these features and optimize for them.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:12.740]   I think you can do both if you're a woman who is really interested in your professional
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:17.460]   development and you're very much focused on pursuing your career.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:23.060]   All that is great, but you also need to adapt to the feminine qualities that men appreciate
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:26.740]   and bring those things to him for him to be attracted to you.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:33.900]   The point is that there's one meter and it's a cumulative matter of these factors.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:40.620]   So if you're lacking in one factor that is attractive to your ideal husband, if you can
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:46.740]   improve the other factors that are under your control, then you can do that and be fine.
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:50.860]   Now switching now for the male audience.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:57.540]   Of the things that are attractive to women, especially someone to whom you're going to
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:03.820]   marry, because for men who want to marry a woman, it seems as though things can go wrong
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:05.980]   on multiple levels.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:10.980]   What I mean is it can go wrong in the sense that you're just not attracted to women, period,
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:13.860]   and no woman wants to be with you.
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:18.140]   On the other hand, you can have a woman who wants to be with you, but she's not willing
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.580]   to marry you.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.340]   Or you might find someone who likes to be with you, but she's not willing to be in a
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.700]   romantic relationship with you.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:33.100]   And the insight that I appreciate from what Homath created is that according to him, there
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.620]   are two metrics by which women evaluate men.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:45.340]   They are the metrics of security, or what we can call a good guy score, and the metrics
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.180]   of attraction, or what we can call a bad boy score.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:54.020]   And both of these are generally important to women.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:42:02.500]   If a man provides high degrees of security, meaning he's a good guy, but he doesn't provide
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:08.660]   high degrees of attraction, then he winds up friend-zoned.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.660]   And that was one of the things that I didn't understand when I was in college.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:17.060]   I was friend-zoned continually because I was always high security and low attraction.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:21.380]   I didn't understand that you had to optimize for both of those things in order to attract
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.100]   the attention of women.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.180]   Now I subconsciously optimized for both of those things with my wife based upon the way
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.100]   that our relationship emerged.
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:33.420]   Today I can look back and I can see that, but I was blind to it at the time.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:38.460]   I thought, "Well, I want to be a good guy, and if I'm a good guy, then those would be
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:41.060]   the things that would be attractive to women."
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:44.280]   And I was a good guy who got friend-zoned continually.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:49.060]   It's important for men to understand this because it's utterly maddening if you think
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:53.140]   that what women are looking for is just good guys, and you think, "I'm a good guy.
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.820]   I have lots of good guy characteristics.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.820]   What is going on?
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:58.820]   What's wrong with me?"
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:01.060]   And you need to understand that's not the only thing.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:07.140]   And I'm emphasizing this because there is a high correlation between the kinds of young
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:12.020]   men who are listening to what I'm saying right now an hour and 40 minutes deep into this
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:18.460]   podcast and the bad dating outcomes that some men are getting.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.940]   It's because you are optimized for being a good guy, for providing high security for
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.420]   a woman, but you're not optimizing for attraction.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.100]   You don't have a decent bad boy score.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.580]   So if you are optimizing for high security but not for attraction, and you just have
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:41.580]   a good guy score and no bad boy score, then you wind up getting friend-zoned.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:46.300]   Now if we pivot to the other dimension, and if any of this is confusing, just watch the
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:52.100]   video and you'll understand, but if we pivot to the other dimension, we have where you're
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.100]   optimizing for attraction.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.380]   We can call this your bad boy score.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:59.660]   Now here is what women are often attracted to.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:06.620]   They're attracted to bad boys, men who have great sex appeal and express very masculinity
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:13.940]   and confidence in various ways that turn them on, but these relationships don't often wind
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.340]   up in marriage.
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:20.940]   You have just straight out sex appeal or some version of a situationship, which is what
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:26.380]   many women, at least if I listen to what they say, are in today, that is not resulting in
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.500]   marriage.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:34.140]   And so they're choosing men who are very attractive, either for a purely sexual relationship or
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:39.740]   they become one of multiple women that he has available to him in some kind of situationship
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:44.540]   and they're hoping that, "Well, someday he's going to pick me," and in reality he never
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:49.420]   does because he doesn't provide that level of security that she would necessarily even
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:54.420]   say yes to him, and/or he's just not interested in marriage.
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:45:00.820]   If we can optimize on both of these scales, the good guy score and the bad boy score,
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:07.660]   if we can optimize on both of these as a man, then there's a much higher probability that
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:14.420]   you would be able to attract your ideal wife to you and see that relationship all the way
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:16.180]   through to marriage.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:18.580]   So what makes up these scores?
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:23.300]   Let's start with the good guy score, and the idea here is that these things would be added
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.300]   up.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:29.020]   So we'll start with the kind of higher level aspects.
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:32.560]   The first one is labeled by HOMATH as investment.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.940]   So a big one is money.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.380]   Do you have money?
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:40.380]   Do you have the ability to spend money on a woman?
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:44.580]   Do you have the ability to spend money on her and on her lifestyle?
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:50.180]   I want to quickly hasten to add this should not cause you to be embittered if you are
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.460]   a man.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:57.660]   There is a common point of bitterness where men will say, "Well, she's just in it for
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.660]   money."
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.060]   And that is the case.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.780]   Some superficial women might say, "Well, I just want him to spend lots of money on me."
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:09.900]   But money is a decent proxy for a woman for her future security.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.700]   And so your ability to have money is a good guy score.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.620]   This is your ability to provide security for her.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:21.180]   If she is going to be in a relationship with you and she is going to give you her youth
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:26.180]   and her beauty and bear your children, then the amount of security that you can provide
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:28.660]   for her is an important component.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:34.060]   And so it should be your ambition to have money so that you can spend money on her.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:39.620]   And not all spending money or having money is just frivolous and superficial.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.460]   It may be expressed differently at different times in a woman's life.
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.100]   But money is an important feature.
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:50.260]   Wealthy guys have a much easier time attracting women because of their ability to provide
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.180]   financial support.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:54.380]   So investment means money.
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:55.380]   Quality time.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.780]   Is he a guy who invests into her and provides quality time?
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:00.140]   Is a man supportive?
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.780]   Does he provide commitment?
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.700]   Is he emotionally available and emotional bonding?
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.220]   Does he change his lifestyle for her?
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:12.420]   These are very highly important things that a woman is probably going to consider to be
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.900]   very important.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.780]   And it's very high on the good guy score.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:18.500]   It gives you lots of points.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.860]   Next you have your presentability.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:20.860]   Your appearance.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:21.860]   Do you dress well?
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:24.260]   Do you present yourself well in terms of your physical appearance?
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.620]   Do you have good social skills?
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.700]   Are you the kind of person who is comfortable in various situations and able to draw people
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.700]   out with good social skills?
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:32.700]   Likeability.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.700]   Reputation.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:36.020]   Are you thought well of by others in the community?
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:43.180]   Your reputation is very important to women and a woman is likely to draw some measure,
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:49.320]   some significant measure of her attraction to you based upon how attractive you are to
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.100]   other people in the community, both men and in many cases especially women.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.620]   Then you have the category of loyalty.
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.900]   Are you a man who is trustworthy?
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.940]   Are you willing to be monogamous with her and exclusive?
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.560]   Are you a man who exercises and demonstrates self-control?
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:12.060]   And then there are the bonus factors which matter a lot maybe, I guess.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:16.660]   Homa says they matter a lot to many women of conveniences and possessions and where
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:21.660]   you're from and little quirks and idiosyncrasies and about a bazillion different things that
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.620]   could cause you to be that special someone that she really likes.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:31.400]   Now the important point here is that all of these are good guy scores.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:38.540]   They're all things that you can and should optimize for and they're important on the
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.900]   good guy score.
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:45.060]   They are not sufficient, however, to move you into the husband zone or Prince Charming
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.060]   zone.
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:51.700]   So you have a separate set of metrics that are your bad boy score or your attraction.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.420]   So what are those features of your bad boy score?
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.580]   And they don't have to be negative.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:00.880]   Just to be clear, when we say bad boy, we're using a cultural meme.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.780]   You understand what it means.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:10.540]   It doesn't mean that you have to be a morally defective man to have a bad boy score.
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:17.900]   You can be an upright and morally righteous man and have a very high bad boy score.
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:19.380]   That's just a meme for it.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:25.220]   So let's start at most important or kind of working from the hardcore end down and these
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.300]   are additive.
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:28.100]   So you have a man's body.
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.720]   Is he a body type that is attractive to her?
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720]   What is his height?
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.680]   Very tall, not so tall, very short.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.180]   What is his voice like?
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:37.180]   His muscularity?
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:39.420]   What are his hands like?
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.820]   His level of fitness?
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.660]   How attractive is his face?
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:45.500]   What's the amount of chemistry that you have together?
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.500]   What are the pheromones?
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:51.020]   Is he a man who has good hygiene, good posture, good fashion sense?
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:54.100]   These are things related to your body.
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:50:00.380]   Then you have factors related to your masculinity, your competence in something, your confidence,
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:02.920]   your personal confidence and your competence.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:05.740]   Are you strong, tough, smart?
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.900]   Do you have a high income?
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.020]   Are you powerful?
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.100]   Are you fun?
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.380]   Are you very skillful, have a lot of talent?
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.180]   Are you a very high status man?
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.940]   Are you respected by others?
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.060]   Are you dominant?
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:22.280]   Are you funny, smooth, capable, sly, persevering, mysterious, popular?
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.060]   Are you comfortable to be around?
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.060]   Are you stoic?
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.660]   Do you have good leadership, a strong frame?
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.980]   Are you protective, aggressive?
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:33.540]   Or are you optimistic, self-assured, positive?
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.740]   Those are kind of the light traits or the dark traits, or I'm superior, I always get
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:40.620]   my way, nobody better mess with me, kind of these strong features.
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:45.820]   And so the point is to go down that list and just ask yourself, could I optimize for some
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.180]   of these other features?
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:57.340]   And if you're able to optimize on both scales, then the chances are good that you'll be broadly
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.780]   attractive to women generally, which will improve your ability to attract the highest
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.460]   quality woman.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:07.380]   And back to your kind of sample set, your bell curve, let's say that you would like
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:12.940]   to marry a woman who for you on your metrics is an 8 or 9, 7, 8, 9, 10, something like
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:16.900]   that, well, if you can optimize for these things early in life, then you have the highest
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:23.780]   possible chances of optimizing or being able to see this through to fruition, to matrimony
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.380]   and beyond.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:31.780]   So the key lesson is that I thought Ho Math did so beautifully at clarifying as something
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.180]   that I learned the hard way.
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.020]   It's not enough just to be a good guy.
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:42.020]   You want to maximize for both of those things, for both metrics, for your attraction factors
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:44.580]   and for your security factors.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:51.100]   And if you will maximize or optimize for both of those things and find some expression that
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:58.460]   is appropriate for you, then it will be simpler and easier for you to catch the eye of an
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:03.300]   attractive woman, someone that you would like to pursue further to the next step of the
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.340]   relationship.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.980]   She has to do her part to become an attractive woman, but you also have to do your part to
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:15.560]   understand how to be appealing to the kind of woman that you would like to attract.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:19.340]   Some people have many of these characteristics naturally.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:23.740]   I don't know if they're innate, but at least they didn't have to intentionally acquire
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.580]   these characteristics.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:30.380]   Some people come by many of these characteristics just as a product of their upbringing or their
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:34.980]   parents or how they were trained, whatever the natural reasons are that they have them.
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.060]   But it's better, I think, to listen to people who've had to learn things the hard way and
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:40.900]   figure out, "Wait a second.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:41.900]   I don't have that.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:46.500]   What's going wrong?" and then figure out how to fix it so that you can make it go right.
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:49.020]   And I would suggest to you that this is a good place to start.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:52.980]   I'll link the video in the show notes, but I think it's useful and a good list for you
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:53.980]   to work down.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:53:01.740]   I close with just simply the encouragement that I want to leave you with.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.960]   There are good reasons to want to be married.
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:10.180]   You want to be serious about it so that you can get good results, but not obsessed with
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.180]   it.
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:15.540]   Being obsessed with getting married winds up being creepy.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.940]   So don't be obsessed with it.
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:24.140]   That creates a very kind of weird air for men or for women, both across, that winds
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.020]   up moving you into creep-ville.
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.620]   Don't be a creep.
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:30.460]   So be serious about it, not obsessed with it.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:38.060]   The reason to be serious about it is simply that the ease of getting successfully married
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:43.540]   is it's much easier when you are younger and you get better long-term outcomes.
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:48.780]   And people are most likely to not be serious when they are younger.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:54.460]   And so if you are younger, the best strategy is simply to be serious about it.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:59.820]   A young man or woman who knows he or she wants to be married and is serious about it, and
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:04.880]   by serious I mean working hard on your own characteristics, meeting people, interacting
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:10.380]   with people, thinking about characteristics, and looking for a very high-quality potential
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:14.820]   spouse, and then being willing to move down the relationship pathway to marriage when
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.780]   that occurs, will get the best outcomes.
[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:20.520]   You'll get the best outcomes for multiple levels.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:25.380]   You'll get all the benefits of marrying when young in terms of the relationship built together.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:28.740]   It's easier to marry young because you're not set in your ways, you're able to interact
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:30.300]   with your potential spouse.
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:33.840]   As long as you're not getting married too young, you know that this is what you want
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.140]   to do, you know that this is the pathway you go down, you have enough life experience not
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:39.800]   to feel like it's a ball and chain or any of that stuff.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:45.060]   As long as you're ready and you know that, then being married young comes with enormous
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:46.560]   benefits for your marriage.
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.820]   It comes with enormous benefits for your ability to have children, and potentially more than
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:51.900]   a handful.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:55.260]   It comes with enormous benefits for you in the long term.
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:00.140]   A man who marries young and who has a wife who believes in him and invests into him,
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:05.640]   I think is able generally to advance much more quickly in the world because of the transforming
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:09.900]   influence of that marriage.
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:14.500]   And a woman who marries young I think has a great opportunity, as long as she chooses
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:20.340]   someone of good moral character, has a great opportunity to have the best guy that she's
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.840]   capable of attracting.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:29.180]   If she waits longer and she just optimizes for sex for some old professional athlete
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:36.020]   or something like that, then she loses out on the guy who would be the best guy to marry.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.540]   And the whole marriage equation changes for men as they become more attractive and more
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:45.100]   competent and have more money, then a lot of things change as they get older.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:51.100]   And so it's a very difficult mass of problems to work your way through.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:56.360]   So optimizing for these things when young is really helpful and important, but not obsessing
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.540]   over them.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:02.040]   And if you're getting good results and you see that, "Hey, I'm meeting people, I'm generally
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.420]   able to attract people who would be a good fit, and it's just a matter of finding the
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.340]   right person at the right time of life," just continue what you're doing.
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:13.320]   If you're not getting good results, you're not able to find a suitable or high quality
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.900]   potential spouse, or you're not able to attract people into dating relationships, something's
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:23.840]   going wrong, take a hard look and try to figure out where is the problem and identify it.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.100]   Because it will not be easier for you down the road.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:31.180]   It is not easier when you're older, especially men.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:33.940]   Hear me clearly.
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:41.980]   There is an entirely false idea that is being spread right now for young men.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:46.500]   The false idea is this, "Well, as a man, you're more attractive to women when you're older
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:51.460]   and wealthier and more established and everything is going well, and so therefore it's no problem.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.840]   You don't need to be serious about getting married.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.500]   It's no problem at all."
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:01.140]   This is false, and it will give you a false sense of security if you're not serious about
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:02.140]   it.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:05.700]   Now, it can be something that is a matter of hope.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:09.860]   At any point in time, a man or woman could marry or can marry.
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:12.440]   There's no age at which you can't do it.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:16.340]   As you proceed throughout life, it's good to have that hope alive and say, "What's going
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:17.340]   on?
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.340]   Why am I not married?"
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:22.420]   Again, is it a matter of my attractiveness to an ideal candidate?
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:26.980]   Is it a matter of finding where these people are, or is it a matter of the ability to see
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.600]   them through?
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:34.460]   But young men especially are having this false hope, and they're saying, "Hey, it's going
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:36.140]   to be easier for me down the road."
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:39.620]   This is not true, and it's not true for multiple reasons.
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:44.900]   Yes, you can attract various—you may be able to attract women into a sexual relationship
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:46.420]   with you.
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:52.400]   In today's world where promiscuity is widely accepted and where it's relatively easy to
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.340]   fornicate with women, fine.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:58:02.180]   That can be good, but optimizing for marriage is not better when you're older.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:04.100]   It's harder because there's a bigger age gap.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:10.300]   It's harder because the most likely marriage candidates are often going to be taken as
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:16.220]   you get older, and it's harder because your experience of life changes, and the amount
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.380]   of time that you have to build a long enduring marriage just becomes much more difficult.
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.020]   Then even the decision to marry becomes more difficult.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:28.860]   If you marry when you're young, a lot of times as a man, you generally don't have that much
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:30.020]   money.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:34.300]   If you are able to attract a high-quality woman, I think of it like that she's basically
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:36.340]   getting shares in a startup.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:43.820]   She is joining an enterprise that can be great rather than one that is great, and so she's
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:45.740]   getting shares in a startup.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:49.460]   It's all about potential, who you might become as a man.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:53.000]   She can affect you and influence you enormously.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.940]   It is so powerful to have a woman who believes in you and a wife by your side, especially
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:59.760]   through those early years.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:05.860]   If you wait until you are older, number one, there's no guarantee that you'll be old and
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.420]   attractive.
[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:08.420]   Some men have this idea.
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:12.780]   "When I'm 45 years old, I'm going to be a multimillionaire and have a six-pack and live
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:18.300]   on the beach, and I'm going to be dating Joshua's friend from college who's this beautiful 19-year-old
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.300]   girl."
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.300]   Okay, maybe.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.540]   But there's a decent chance that that doesn't work out at all.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:25.820]   It's a decent chance that you're completely broke and you declared bankruptcy for the
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:30.820]   second time when you're 45 years old, and now you don't have any of those attractive
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:32.420]   qualities.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:37.100]   But even if you do, even if you do have those attractive qualities, imagine yourself now
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:42.220]   as a 45-year-old man, multimillionaire, living on the beach, great shape.
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:46.860]   You have access to any woman that you want to for a sexual relationship, but now you
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:47.860]   want to marry.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.620]   Who are you going to marry?
[01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:55.580]   Are you going to marry a 45-year-old woman like you, who has a similar understanding
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:01.660]   of life and experience in life, but is unable to bear you any children or probably unable
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.780]   to bear you any children?
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:06.820]   That doesn't seem super attractive.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:10.660]   So now let's imagine, are you going to marry a 30-year-old woman who's 15 years younger
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:16.300]   than you are, but hey, maybe she can have some children and she's younger and that's
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:18.100]   okay because I'm older and she's younger.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:21.580]   Well, maybe you will, but now what's your financial risk in marriage?
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:25.060]   The first thing you're thinking about when you've got millions of dollars is, "Well,
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:29.820]   she's going to divorce me and take half my money and ruin it," and that's a genuine objection,
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:30.900]   a genuine problem.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.860]   You come to me and I'm going to be talking to you about your prenup, but then are you
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:35.860]   so committed to marriage?
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:39.980]   Is she so committed to marriage that it's no problem and it absolutely makes sense?
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:43.220]   And that's to say nothing of finding a 30-year-old that you even want to marry.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:47.460]   If she's 30 years old and she's not married, it's because she either is not an attractive
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:51.220]   marriage candidate or she's not chosen to optimize for marriage.
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:56.780]   So maybe she's lived the last 12 years of her legal adult life doing something else,
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:03.180]   but in 12 years, an attractive woman wasn't able to get married.
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:08.340]   An attractive woman who wants to marry, who's optimizing for marriage, can marry.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:09.700]   And so what's wrong?
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.100]   Why was she not married?
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.100]   Why is she not?
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:15.460]   So I'm going to go back to a 20-year-old and I'm going to marry a 20-year-old.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:16.460]   Come on.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:18.140]   You're 45 years old.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:20.140]   You're going to marry a 20-year-old?
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:21.140]   For what?
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:23.820]   You have no shared culture, nothing in common.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:25.300]   It's the strangest relationship.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:26.300]   Oh, it's physical.
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:29.280]   Okay, fine, but it's weird.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.420]   And why would a 20-year-old want to marry you, especially a marriage-minded 20-year-old,
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:37.820]   for something other than your money?
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:42.680]   So don't fall into this false idea that somehow it's all going to be easier when I'm older
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.160]   and richer.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.200]   It's not necessary to be rich to marry.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.480]   And so if you weren't able to attract someone when you're younger, go back and figure out
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:53.080]   what it is.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:02:03.760]   A younger woman who is marriage-minded is going to understand that you're not rich yet,
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:09.060]   but she can see ambition and she can see character and she can rate you on that stuff knowing
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:11.580]   where you're likely to wind up.
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:16.260]   The fact that you're able to get rich at 45 is not generally a surprise to an insightful
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:18.360]   woman who stops and thinks about it.
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.020]   Does this guy have the characteristics that he's likely to do it?
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:27.300]   My point is there is a false idea that is going out there and people are saying, "Well,
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:31.000]   it's just going to be—for men especially—oh, it's easier when you're older."
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.540]   And again, there is an element of truth to it in that you may be more attractive when
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.980]   you are wealthy.
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:42.500]   That is certainly something that is true, but that doesn't optimize for marriage.
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:48.920]   It may optimize for promiscuity and fornication, and that does not lead you to a happy life.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:56.900]   Do you really want to go and trade places with Leonardo DiCaprio or Dan Bilzerian?
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:03.020]   Are these guys your role models of where you want to be at 45 years old or 50 years old?
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:08.000]   Dating some 19-year-old model for three years and then sending her down the road to replace
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.340]   with another?
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.380]   I think there's an element in which we can all acknowledge that, "All right, well, that
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:17.020]   sounds kind of fun, I guess, but if you stop and listen to them, I'll play an audio here
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.020]   for you in a moment.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:24.160]   I was expecting this for a long time, but I finally got it from Bilzerian," and it just
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.160]   shows it.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.960]   By the way, you can separate the money from the lifestyle.
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:37.260]   Would you rather be Pierce Brosnan, married to a woman for decades and have all of that
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:44.320]   shared life experience, or Leonardo DiCaprio, just a pathetic old man with lots of money
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.360]   continually cycling through and using young women?
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.000]   Let me play you a clip that came out I think about a month ago, and I've expected this
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.040]   for a while, but it's interesting.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.920]   This clip is important for us to listen to from some of these guys and understand you
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.100]   don't want to wind up like them.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:06.060]   Minor parental warning here, this clip is a little bit vulgar, but it's important.
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:11.620]   Here's just a clip from a recent podcast interview with Dan Bilzerian.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:15.300]   How many women have you slept with in your life total?
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.300]   Thousands.
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:18.060]   Like Will Chamberlain levels?
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.060]   Not 20,000.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:24.700]   20,000 is a bit ambitious, but I mean, like I said, I was having sex with three girls
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.420]   a day on average at least at a minimum.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:32.860]   If I only had sex with two girls in a day, that was like we're having some real off day
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:33.860]   or something.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.620]   Some days four, sometimes whatever, five, seven.
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:43.940]   The most was nine, but I don't know.
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:46.740]   It didn't really seem to matter that much.
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:47.740]   I don't know.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:52.620]   Ten some, or ten some, I guess, you count yourself, ten some.
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:53.620]   I don't know.
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:54.620]   I don't know.
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.620]   They're just waiting.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:58.300]   It's just like having sex with one girl, they're just waiting.
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:04:59.300]   I don't know.
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:04.140]   There's a lot of obligation for you to have sex with nine girls.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:08.660]   I had this image in my mind when I was growing up of how awesome this would be.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:09.660]   I don't know.
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:12.940]   What I kind of landed on was I think it's better to have a monogamous relationship.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:20.500]   As strange as that is coming from me, because I think if ... You've got two choices.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:25.700]   You can just do whatever you want and be free and allow the women to be free and just use
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:29.300]   condoms with all the girls and not care about if they hook up with other guys and it's just
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:35.580]   like purely sexual and whatever, or I think you can find a girl that you enjoy spending
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.940]   time with and that you actually trust each other.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:46.300]   I think it's hard to have that ... I'm not saying it's impossible, but I think it's unlikely
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:51.920]   to find a woman that is going to be okay with you sleeping with other women that actually
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.980]   cares about you for the right reasons.
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:54.980]   It is possible.
[02:05:54.980 --> 02:06:00.940]   If you find a bisexual, very open, whatever, I'm not saying it's impossible.
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:02.380]   It's very unlikely.
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:08.580]   I also think that even if the girl is okay with it, I think that you cause internal damage
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:15.220]   to her and I found that with Andrea and it didn't feel good to me, but like I said, I
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:20.820]   do think that one cool girl that does stuff with you that you actually have a mental connection
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.140]   with, I think the sex is better.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:25.580]   I think you're more relaxed.
[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:29.500]   I think you have less things to deal with, less distractions.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.340]   Your energy is not being pulled in a bunch of different directions.
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:37.380]   That's one of the complications of polyamory is the amount of logistics that you have to
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:42.360]   like if you're in relationship in some way, even if there's like a hierarchy to the polyamory,
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:44.660]   you have like six different schedules you have to manage.
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:45.740]   You run a company.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:47.180]   There's trying to do other things.
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:48.180]   It's draining.
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:49.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.180]   Like you have to do like a lot.
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:55.660]   You have to do like 30 or 50 or 100 or whatever, or you have to ... I don't know.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:01.860]   In my opinion, I think the one, but I really don't like the dynamic of three girls.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:04.420]   I think it's like guaranteed to cause competition.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:07.140]   I don't think the girl's going to be happy.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:11.780]   Maybe two could work if they were into each other, maybe, but then if you're just hanging
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:13.580]   out with one, the other one's just sitting there.
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:14.580]   I don't know.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:18.740]   I haven't found too many dynamics that were super successful long term.
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:25.540]   Short term, I have, but not for any like indefinite period of time.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:27.860]   Don't take my opinion for it.
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:28.860]   Just understand.
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:34.460]   Again, not everyone, there are wackos who don't ever get introspective like Bilzerian,
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.860]   but they're sociopaths.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:42.940]   And you don't want to be a sociopath, but all non-sociopaths that go down that pathway,
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:47.900]   that Bilzerian or DiCaprio or whatever, eventually they wind up in a similar situation.
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:48.900]   What was the point?
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:50.100]   What was the point of this?
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:52.300]   But you don't see that reflected in other people.
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:57.340]   So in summary, don't be the guy who just says, "Well, it's going to be easier when I'm older
[02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:58.580]   and richer."
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:07:59.580]   It's not.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:02.200]   It's never easier down the road.
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.300]   You don't want to marry poorly.
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:07.520]   You don't want to marry a low quality woman.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:11.360]   You don't want to marry the wrong woman.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:20.900]   What you want to do is marry the right woman, a high quality woman at a young age, if possible.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:25.180]   So you want to be serious about preparing yourself to be able to attract her at a young
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:29.060]   age and then move into marriage at a young age.
[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:34.540]   And if you can get both of those things right, you can choose a high quality woman because
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.420]   you were thoughtful and careful in your analysis and you chose someone that was optimized for
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:43.340]   marriage rather than optimized for some other factor.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:47.600]   And you marry at a young age, that's when you get the best long-term outcomes.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.220]   So be serious about it and recognize that we don't want to get into a situation in which
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:55.080]   we feel pressure, "I just got to marry whoever's available."
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.260]   That's not the best long-term outcome.
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:00.960]   There are lies that are told to women consistently and repeatedly.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:06.740]   The most common one that is happening right now is that there's always time, you always
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:10.280]   have time, you always have time, and that's simply not true.
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.900]   And there are lies that are told to men and those lies are emerging.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:16.100]   We need to combat them, both of them.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:21.300]   And the way to optimize is as I have described, take it seriously, not obsessively, don't
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:25.020]   be a weirdo, but recognize that you can change yourself.
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:30.540]   You can optimize your personal qualities to be attractive to your ideal spouse candidate.
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:35.260]   You can go out and you can interact with and meet many potential spouses in a forum or
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:40.240]   format that's appropriate for you and one of those relationships with a high-quality
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.540]   potential spouse can move towards marriage.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:47.760]   Even though it may be difficult or more demanding in our current era and we need some kind of
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:53.300]   weird long two-hour and ten-minute podcast about it that we wouldn't have needed 80 years
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.260]   ago, it's still possible and it's still doable.
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:01.780]   So I've done the podcast, now you have to do the hard work and I wish you well.
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:02.780]   I really do.
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:03.780]   I hope that it works.
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:08.480]   I want to see our culture optimize again towards preparing young people to be ready for marriage
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:11.460]   at a young age, build strong families that endure.
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:15.500]   I want you to have a 70-year, an 80-year, a 90-year marriage.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:21.140]   I want our children to see that and for us to establish that and create those kinds of
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:27.260]   long-enduring families rather than the kind of situations that we see around us.
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:33.420]   I hope that this has been a useful way for you to think through some of these issues.
