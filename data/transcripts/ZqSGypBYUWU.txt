[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   In the words found in the Epistle to the Romans in chapter 12, reading verses 6, 7 and 8.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   "Having therefore gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith, or ministry, let us wait
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   on our ministering.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation, he that giveth,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth with diligence, he that showeth mercy with
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   cheerfulness."
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Now, we are considering this most interesting and important statement.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We've already considered it in detail and from the standpoint of the particular instructions
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   that the Apostle was giving to the members of the Church at Rome.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And in doing that, we have discovered that he is incidentally and at the same time giving
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   us a description of the life of the early Church.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And we are now paying particular attention to that.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   The danger is, of course, that we should just be content with giving the meaning of these
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   different terms, such as teaching and exhortation and ministering and governing and so on, and
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   leave it at that.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   But we've seen that we mustn't do that.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   As this is a description of the life and behavior of the early Church, we naturally must go
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   on to ask the question, "Well, then, do we see ourselves in that picture?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And if we do not, why don't we?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   What has happened to the Christian Church that she should appear in general today to
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   be so different from the picture that we find of her in the New Testament?"
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We have dismissed the suggestion that these things only apply to the early Church.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That seems to me to be one of the most dangerous things that we can ever say.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We will soon be cutting down, as so many are doing at the present time, we shall be cutting
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   down the New Testament teaching to suit us and to conform to our state and condition.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And that, of course, is just to reverse the right and the true procedure.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We must measure ourselves always in the light of what we have in the New Testament.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And unless we have overwhelming proof that any statement, any particular statement, has
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   reference only to the Apostolic Age, well, then, we must realize that it applies to us
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   today as much as it did to the early Church.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, now then, in doing this, we have found this so far, that from the standpoint of order
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and of government and so on, that the Christian Church has obviously wandered very far indeed
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   from that which is described in the New Testament.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And we try to give some sort of historical review and survey of that story in order that
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   we might see how it happened.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Our object is, of course, that in the light of all this, we must take advantage of all
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   this present talk today about Church unity to make sure that the only unity that we are
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   interested in is a unity that reproduces what we find in the New Testament.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We've had more illustrations during this week of the other type of unity.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Now, the thing for us to do is to examine that and every other proposal for unity or
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   every other attempt for unity in the light of this particular teaching.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's no use just starting with things as they are and modifying them a little bit here
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and there.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   The Roman Catholic Church is a little modification, the Church of England is a little modification
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and so on, and so we get one great Church which will still maintain most of the characteristics
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   of all the different sections going into the amalgamation.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That is not the way in which we view these things.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   We say that we must view all things in the light of the New Testament teaching.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And as people are interested in unity, we of all people are to be interested in unity.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   The Church is to be one and she is to be seen to be one.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And surely the call that comes to us is to manifest the type of unity that you read of
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   in the New Testament and to assert that that and that alone is the Christian Church.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And not some counterfeit produced by men.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Very well, we've done that, but still we are left with one other problem.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Or rather one other aspect of this same matter.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The Church as we've known her is not only different from the New Testament Church in
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   her order and in her government and so on, but surely we must recognize a great difference
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   also in her mode of worship, in her way of conducting worship, in their way of expressing worship.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Here I say we are given a picture, a little cameo of the kind of thing that happened in
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   the early Church and I've reminded you several times of the corresponding passage or a similar
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   passage at Enneret in 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Well, the Apostle puts it like this in verse 26 and following.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   "How is it then, brethren, when ye come together, every one of the psalm, of the doctrine, of
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   the tongue, of the revelation, hath an interpretation?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Let all things be done unto Ediphi."
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And there are other passages.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   There is a statement in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians which again
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   gives us a picture of the Church.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   "And making melody in your hearts, singing in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   melody in your hearts."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Such pictures as that give us an insight into the type of worship that was characteristic
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   of the early Church.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Well now, once more, if we are intelligent readers of our scriptures, we must obviously
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   ask ourselves a question.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Is our worship something that corresponds to the pictures that we have of the worship
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   of the early Church?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Again, if not, why not?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And how have we moved from what we find here to what we know today, with what we are familiar
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   with?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now, why is this important for us?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I do want to stress the all-importance of our doing this.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   You know, my friends, evangelical people have gone in, it seems to me, so often for a type
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   of Bible study, or Bible reading, whatever they may call it, which rarely has been most
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   effective.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We've been content with a kind of letter knowledge of the scripture.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We haven't troubled always to look at the doctrine, to find the doctrine, to dig out
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   the doctrine, and to see its relevance to us.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Now here is something at once which surely demands our attention.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's got everything to say to us at this present time.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Again, I want us to consider this in the light of everything that is happening round and
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   about us.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You've seen again this week a type of worship with dresses and vestments, as they call them,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and all the trappings and the paraphernalia of a certain type of what is called worship.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And, it isn't that you are denying it, that is the trend at the present time.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   There is an increasing tendency to what you may call liturgical services, and all that
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   accompanies that.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Now this is true in, I think, most sections of the Christian church.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I've been observing during the last thirty to forty years the increasing tendency in
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   what are called free churches to modify their type of worship.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's become increasingly liturgical.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   There has been an increasing tendency to read prayers, and to have formal services at the
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   communion table, and in baptism, and so on.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The whole tendency has been to move in this what is called liturgical direction, to have
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   a kind of litany.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's been an imitation on the part of the free churches of what they've seen and known
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   in the Anglican church.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And the Anglican church in turn, as I'm going to show you, took most of it over from
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   the Roman Catholic church.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But with all this that is to be seen on the television, and all that's appearing in
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   the papers, and so on, this has had a great impetus.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And therefore this whole tendency in the direction of read prayers and responses, and the whole
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   full liturgical service with putting on various vestments and gowns and various other coverings,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   all this, I say, is obviously a very marked tendency at the present time.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Well now then, here we are.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You see, what we have to do is to say, "Where is that to be found in the New Testament?"
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   How does that compare, for instance, with what we see in these three verses that we
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   are looking at in this twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Romans?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   In other words, it seems to me that at the present time again, a dispute which has been
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   going on many a time in the church is in its acute form once more.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   There is a main division between what are called sometimes religions of authority and
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   religions of the spirit.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Or, if you prefer it, there is a vital difference between the Catholic type of worship and
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   the truly Protestant type of worship.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   There is all the difference in the world between a worship that is mainly dependent upon ceremonial
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and ritual, and a simple type of worship which exalts the freedom of the spirit.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Now, if there's anybody here tonight who feels that, "What's this got to do with
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   me?"
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Well, then all I say is that you don't know your New Testament.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's got everything to do with you.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   If you really believe this is the Word of God, you must be concerned about this.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And whether you like it or not, as I've already reminded you, you will be compelled
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to take decisions on these very matters.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   If you don't see the trend to Rome, well, I'm afraid you must be blind.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It's moving and moving very rapidly.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   The proposal to have one church in this country, and that is the proposal, is a proposal which
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   tells us that it is to be episcopal in its government and liturgical in its form of worship.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And most people are very happy and ready to accept that.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And as we have been reminded very forcibly again this week, the ultimate objective is
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   to have one great world church, including the Church of Rome, or rather the Church of
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Rome, including all the others.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And so you will be committed to the type of worship, as they call it, which you've seen
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   represented on your television screens and in the newspaper pictures this week.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Now, the question is, do you want that?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Do you believe in that?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Do you regard that as right?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Now, all this, you see, is raised for us by these three verses.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Because here we have a picture of the worship of the New Testament early church.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Now then, the question I therefore ask is this, is this vital?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Is it a vital matter?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Or is it only a matter of taste?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   What I've been hearing so much throughout the years, and I've been very sickened by it,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   is people who say, you know, the language of the litany is so beautiful.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Cranmer was a master at language, and at this kind of liturgical language.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And the prayers are so beautiful.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   That's an argument that one hears so frequently amongst free church people, as well as amongst
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Anglicans themselves and others.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Well now, the question I ask is this, is that the test, and is that the standard that you apply?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Or is this merely a matter of tradition?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Well, I want to deal with these questions with you.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We mustn't approach them merely in terms of prejudices or of traditions.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   That's always wrong.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   We mustn't say we object to these things because we haven't been brought up in their tradition.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   The others mustn't say this is right because this is our tradition.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   All of us, I say, are called upon to re-examine everything in the light of the teaching of the New Testament itself.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   To us, nothing matters except is it right?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And we discover whether it's right or not by coming to the bar of the New Testament Scripture.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Is it in accord with the teaching of the New Testament?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Now, here, at this point, there is an important matter of principle that I have to put before you.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You will know that at the time of the Protestant Reformation, those godly men who were raised
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   up at that time were in general agreed that the New Testament is the ultimate and the only source of authority.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   But they tended to differ amongst themselves at one point, and the most important point, and it is this.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   In what sense is the New Testament teaching binding?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And here there emerged a division as between Martin Luther and John Calvin,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and not only between those two great men, but also between two great sections of the Church in this country.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And the difference was this.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Martin Luther taught that the Scripture is an absolute authority on all matters of doctrine with respect to salvation,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   but that with regard to understanding Church government or forms of worship,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   that the New Testament teaching is not binding,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and that it is allowed to the wisdom of the Church to produce a form of worship
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and indeed a form of Church government determined by men.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Now, Calvin took a very different view there.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   He said that the Scriptures are not only binding in matters like doctrines of salvation,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   they are equally binding and are to be our only rule with regard to Church government and also forms of worship.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Now you see that is a very essentially different point.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Calvin teaches that our worship and our Church government is to be governed by the teaching of the Scriptures.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Luther says no.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Well now, coming to this country, the Church of England followed Luther.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   The Church of England has always taught that while the Scriptures are binding in the matter of the doctrines of salvation,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   they are not binding in the matters of Church government and of worship.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And that has been the traditional position of the Church of England.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   But the other body of course that arose in this country was that body that ultimately became known as Puritan.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And this didn't apply to all of them.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It applied in particular to what we may describe as the radical Puritans.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So you see here are a body of people all believing in the infallibility of the Scripture and its unique inspiration,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   who come to different conclusions with regard to these matters like Church government and forms of worship.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   The Lutherans and the Anglicans regard that as more or less indifferent.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The others say no.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   They are as controlled as much by the teaching of the Scripture as is the doctrine of salvation itself.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Very well.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Having laid that down and having said that, for your guidance,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   because I'm most anxious that we should look at this whole situation in a dispassionate manner,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   in the light of the teaching of the Scripture and in the light of what has happened in the history of the Church,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   so that we may come to a truly understanding opinion on these matters.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We must not be governed by prejudice and likes and dislikes.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   We must rarely make a great effort to arrive at a truly reasonable, rational opinion based upon the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Very well. Let's go to the Scriptures first.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Have we any teaching by our blessed Lord himself with regard to this question?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Does our Lord himself prescribe read prayers or recited prayers?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Did he teach that we were always to offer our worship in the same language and in the same words
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   as those who use the same prayer book every Sunday do?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Can it be proved or established in terms of the teaching of our Lord and Saviour?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Well, now, the argument, of course, put forward by those who believe in read prayers out of prayer books,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   the same prayers every Sunday, their great argument is the Lord's Prayer.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's why we read it at the beginning.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They say our Lord taught his disciples that when he prays, say.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Here he is, they say, composing a prayer for them that he intends them to repeat.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And so, in compiling their prayer books and repeating these prayers Sunday by Sunday,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   they say they are simply doing what our Lord and Master himself first taught the Church.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Now, this obviously has got to be examined.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   It's the only real bit of evidence that they can produce.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   How do we deal with this argument, this position?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Well, this has been dealt with many times.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   It was dealt with by many of the leading Puritans like Dr. John Owen and others.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And these are the arguments which they've always brought forward
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and which seem to me to be inevitable from a study of the Scripture.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   What was our Lord doing when he spoke as he did about when he pray, say?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Well, this is surely something which we should regard as a model prayer.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   What he's saying is not repeat this mechanically every time you pray,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   but he says, and if you look up in Luke 11 where you've got the parallel statement of that,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   the disciples came to him and said, "The Lord will teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples to pray."
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   They were in difficulties about praying.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We're not surprised at that. We've all known the same difficulty.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Prayer can be very difficult.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   So they come and they ask their question.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And our Lord replies, "When you pray, say."
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Surely what he means is, this is the kind of manner or the style in which you should pray.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   In other words, you always start with adoration.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   You don't start with your petitions and your desires, which you must always worship God.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   He's instructing them on the great principles of prayer
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   that we must always recollect and realize we are approaching the almighty and everlasting God,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and before everything else we must offer our adoration and our worship.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And we must desire the coming of his kingdom, that his will be done on earth as it is in heaven, and so on.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And it is only then that we come to the personal petitions and desires.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   In other words, our Lord is saying, in this manner, in this kind of way,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   he's not composing a prayer for them in order simply that they may repeat it mechanically,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   or even repeat it in the spirit.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   He's concerned about laying down the principles, the general ideas, or the ordering of your prayers.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   That's the first answer to this argument that would base the use of liturgies and litanies and so on, on the Lord's prayer.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But secondly, the account of that which is given in the sixth chapter of Matthew's Gospel that we read at the beginning,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   surely indicates quite clearly that our Lord was dealing there with private worship rather than public.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   He talks about going into thy room, into thy chamber, shutting the door, praying in secret,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And that seems to me to be a very powerful argument.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And then, Dr. John Owen points out, and I think there is a good deal to be said for this,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   that in any case, even if our Lord was dictating a prayer which they should repeat,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   he was actually speaking under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It was all before his death. It was all before Pentecost.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And as you do find a kind of ritual and ceremonial and dictation in the Old Testament,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   that our Lord was just showing how, in their position at that time, this is how they should be praying.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I think that can be pressed too far, but as far as it goes, there is some point in what Dr. John Owen says at that point.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   But, and this is surely the final argument and the conclusive one,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   even if we grant that our Lord dictated that prayer and intended that we should repeat it word for word,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   as we do indeed tend to do, so many of us in our services, granting all that,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   how does that justify repeating Sunday by Sunday prayers composed by men?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   That is, after all, something which was uttered by the Lord himself.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Whereas the prayers that are used in these prayer books are the compositions of men,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   men of different centuries, different traditions, and so on.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   So that even if you justify the reciting of the Lord's prayer, it surely does not entitle you to go any further
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and to say that all prayers should be prayers that are composed and written and printed
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and are to be read and repeated Sunday by Sunday.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So that even granting all that, you see the case, surely is one which cannot be substantiated.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Very well. That is the only bit of evidence that can even be remotely adduced from the teaching of our Lord and Saviour.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   What about the apostles? Well, yes, I think everybody has agreed that there is really no evidence whatsoever
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   from either the practice or the teaching of the apostles that they believed in these formal set prayers.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   They didn't repeat, their prayers varied according to their circumstances,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and certainly in the epistles there is no instruction whatsoever.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   They haven't prepared any prayers which they taught the people.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   They've never given any instruction to the people that they should repeat particular prayers.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   In the teaching of the apostles, there is just nothing whatsoever,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   which in itself, of course, is in many ways the most significant thing of all.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Very well. There is the evidence as far as the New Testament is concerned.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   What about the subsequent history of the Church? What about the early centuries?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Well, now this is extremely interesting.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   There is no evidence whatsoever in the first three centuries
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that anything remotely approaching a prayer book was used.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   They did not have these liturgical services.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   It first came in in the fourth century,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   and there seems very good evidence to say that it came in at a place that is familiar to us,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   a place which is called Antioch.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Now, there is evidence, of course, to the contrary.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Let me read to you some evidence out of the writings of that great father in the Church, Tertullian,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   who lived round about 200 AD.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   He lived before it and after it, round about 200.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   This is how he describes their form of worship.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   He says that they pray, looking towards heaven,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   not like the idolaters who looked on their idols and images,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   not embracing altars or images as did the heathen,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   not as they who repeat their prayers after their priests or sacrifices,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   but pouring out our prayers conceived in our breasts.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Now that is very important, isn't it, and very significant.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   He contrasts what the pagans did, who repeat their prayers after their priests or sacrifices.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   In contradistinction to that, he says we pour out our prayers conceived in our breasts,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   which I am going to suggest to you is in entire conformity with the teaching of the New Testament itself.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And then, another quotation from Tertullian.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He is talking about someone being received into the Christian Church,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   after the believer who is joined unto us is thus washed,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   we bring him to those who are called brethren.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   There they are, where they are gathered together for to make their prayers and supplications for themselves
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   and him who is newly illuminated.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   What sort of prayers are these?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   These prayers and supplications he adds, the president of the assembly,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   notice the term, poureth out according to his ability.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   He doesn't read said prayers, but he pours out his prayers according to his ability.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   He doth this work at large.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   In other words, he continues long in his work of praises unto God and in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   But the material phrase is, he poureth it out according to his ability.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And the ability varies from case to case, from men to men,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   in this matter of pouring of prayers from the heart.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Very well. You see, the first three centuries, there was nothing of this at all.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   But then in the fourth century, it came in.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   How did it come in?
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Well, it came in very gradually.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It came in first at Antioch, then began to appear in other places.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And they didn't all have the same prayers.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Prayers were composed by a man in Antioch, another man in another place would compose others,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and eventually this began to happen in the church in Rome.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   She was far from being the first in this matter,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   but eventually they began to do this in the church at Rome.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   However, when that great event took place, which we referred to last week about
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   the Emperor Constantine and the Roman Empire going into the church,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   they then, of course, took over everything,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   and as they took over the government, they did exactly the same with forms of worship.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   They standardized everything.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   They laid it down that the same prayers had to be offered everywhere.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   You see, at first they were not.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You'd have a kind of liturgy in Antioch, a different liturgy in Alexandria,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and so on.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Rome standardized everything.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Everybody has to offer the same prayers everywhere.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's got to be in the same tongue.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It's got to be in Latin.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Of course, that's been modified recently, as we know,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and it's an interesting concession, but the principle, you see, still remains.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   But that is what Rome did.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And at the same time, she not only standardized the prayers,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   but she began to introduce various other innovations.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   These various vestments, these robes and so on,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   that are worn by what they call priests,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   they borrowed most of them from pagan mystery religions.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   There's no question about this.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   It isn't my theory.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   That was her policy.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   They picked out what they regarded as best,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   what the people had been accustomed to.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   In all these pagan religions, you always had and still have a good deal of dressing up and so on.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Well, they took over all that.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   They said that they had baptized these things into the Christian church.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   They also said that this was done under the Old Testament dispensation,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   that Aaron was clothed with various garments, and so were the priests, and so on.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And in this way, they introduced all these vestments,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   which are still being continued,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   and which you've seen for yourselves once more this week in all probability.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Well, now, that's how this tendency came in to liturgical services,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   read prayers, recited prayers, and so on.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Now, here's an interesting question.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Why did they do all this?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Why did this begin in Antioch?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Why did anybody ever think of doing this?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Now, that's the most important question,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and we've really got to consider this very carefully.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And there were two main reasons for it.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And this is--I'm trying to put the argument for liturgies as fairly as I can.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I don't want to give the impression that this was only done at the whim of somebody
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   or the fancy of somebody.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   They had two, what they regarded as very powerful arguments.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The first was that very often the ministers, the priests, whatever they called them,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   were rather ignorant, and they were not capable of offering prayers.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   They were often men who were badly educated,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   and they found themselves in difficulties.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   They welcomed the providing of prayers.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   So that was one argument, ignorance of the ministers.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   But secondly, and this was still more important,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   there was always this danger, as we saw last week in the matter of church government,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   there was always the danger of heretical or wrong teaching.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   This is always a danger.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And the position was that some of these men who were in these positions of leadership,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   they knew that they were being watched in their preaching,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and that they must be very careful, therefore, what they said in their preaching.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   So their tendency was to introduce their heresies into their prayers.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You know, prayers sometimes are sermons and not prayers.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   We're all a bit guilty of this at times, probably.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   It's a thing we've always got to watch.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And some of these heretical teachers did it quite deliberately.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   They were introducing heretical teaching through the medium of their public prayers.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And as long as every man had the freedom and liberty to pray extemporary and freely,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   well, you couldn't do much about it.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Ah, so the Roman church now, she was always keen on discipline, as we saw last week.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   She always wanted to standardize everything.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It was something she took over from the Roman Empire,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   this orderliness and discipline.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Of course, let's agree, this problem of discipline is an important one.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And something's got to be done about the heretics.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Well, they said there's only one way to deal with this.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   We must prescribe the prayers.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   We must set them down.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And we must say, these and these alone are the prayers that are to be offered.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And so, you thereby exclude the danger of heretical teaching coming through the medium of your prayers.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So that, if we want to be generous, we can grant them that their motive was a good one.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   They were anxious to preserve true worship as over and against a false and an erroneous type of worship.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Very well, but that, you see, led eventually to the full Roman system,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   with all the ritual and the ceremonial,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   greatly elaborated, of course, over the question of the Lord's Supper,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   likewise over baptism, and then they began to talk about various other sacraments.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And there was a corresponding liturgy and order and particular statements developed for each one.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It became a vast organization, in a sense, and a complicated liturgy.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   That is the typical procedure of the Roman Catholic Church right through the Middle Ages.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It was all done, of course, by the priests, and the people were away in the distance somewhere,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   often not understanding a word of what was being said.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   But that didn't matter.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It was what the priests did that mattered.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And the people were away and remote and taking no part in this,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   except some occasional responses which were indicated in the liturgy.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Very well, that brings us up to the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Now, what happened here?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   This, again, surely should be of great interest to all of us, from every standpoint,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   to know why we've been brought up in the way we have in our traditions,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   but still more, as I say, to know what we should be thinking and saying and doing
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   at this present time of change and of transition.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   What happened there?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Well, it's very interesting once more to observe.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Luther took over most of what had been done by Rome.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Of course, he corrected the Roman Catholic errors.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Things he'd come to see were quite wrong.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Luther was primarily concerned about this great doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He wasn't so interested in church government, nor indeed in these matters of forms of worship.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   As I say, that was his view even of the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So he took over most of this.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   The type of worship he certainly took over.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   He got rid of the errors of what he believed now to be entirely wrong.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   But as regards the form, he took it over.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Now, Calvin is interesting in this matter, and he's often misunderstood at this point.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   We tend, of course, to think in this country, many of us,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and particularly those who are interested in Puritan, the Puritan teaching,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   we tend to think that Calvin was in the exact position of the Puritans, but he wasn't.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   He wasn't at all.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Calvin believed in having a liturgy.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   He believed in set prayers.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   He allowed more liberty for extemporary prayer than the Roman Catholic Church had ever done,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and indeed more than the Church of England did.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   But on the whole, Calvin believed in a liturgy, and in read and set prayers.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   This is just a fact of history.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Be careful, you see, my friends, in your arguments,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   lest you may be using the name of Calvin very wrongly.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   There is a sense in which it can be argued that the Church of England, in the matter of worship,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   is nearer to Calvin than some of the Puritans were.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Very well, there's the position of Calvin.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   When you come to this country, you come to the name of Thomas Cranmer, of course,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   the man who composed the prayer book of the Church of England.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And he did more or less again what Luther had done in Germany.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   He didn't do away with liturgy and prayer book.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   He took the idea over, and again he rid it of all the errors of Roman Catholicism and its teaching.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And so he composed those prayers, which let us admit very readily,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   are masterpieces from the literary standpoint.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   We're not concerned about that.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   We can grant that they are masterpieces from that standpoint,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   and that he had an unusual facility in the matter of producing such written prayers.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   But the important thing to ask is this, why did he do it?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Why did he decide to have this prayer book,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   and to perpetuate the Roman Catholic type of worship?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And again, we've got to be fair,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and we've got to recognize that this man and those who were with him,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   were men of their age.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Not only were they men of their age,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   they were men who were confronted by certain very special problems.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   It is always our duty as honest thinkers,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   to take in the circumstances in which men were placed when they came to their decisions,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   lest we judge them unfairly.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And what Cranmer was faced with was this.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   He was faced, and this was his biggest problem of all,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   with ignorant clergy.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   They'd been most of them brought up as Roman Catholics,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and they were men who were ignorant of the Scriptures,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   men who were devoid of any spiritual experience.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   But they had changed over in a spirit of fear,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   because it was to them the expedient thing to do,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   and the various other reasons which such people have of changing sides,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   as they did change in the time of Henry VIII,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and then back again in Mary's time,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   then back again in the time of Elizabeth,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   and many similar men did much the same thing in the time of Oliver Cromwell,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and the Commonwealth, and the Restoration, and so on.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Vicars of Bray.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   You know, changing according to the political climate and position, and so on.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Well now, Cranmer was confronted by such people,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but apart from their spiritual state and condition,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   they were actually ignorant.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And one of his arguments was that really they must be provided with prayers.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   They couldn't pray themselves.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   And if the people were ever to be helped in any way,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   well he must provide these ministers with prayers,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   which they could read in their services with the people.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   In addition to that, and this again is the most important point,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   try to conceive of the situation.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Fifteen centuries of Roman Catholicism.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   The system was in the very blood and bones of the people.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   They'd never heard of anything else, or thought of anything else.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Suddenly comes this explosion, the Protestant Reformation.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Now, these men came to see this great matter of the doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   The people didn't see it as clearly.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And one of the arguments that Cranmer used was this.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   He said, "If we now are not only going to change our doctrine of salvation,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   but change the whole form of worship as well,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   well we'll lose everybody and we'll lose everything."
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "The thing that matters," he said, "is that they should be right on the doctrine of salvation,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   justification by faith only.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   The other matter is really indifferent.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   And we can afford to go on with that type of worship
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   until we have truly educated them."
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Now, I think there's something to be said for that argument.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   As a temporary device, as a temporary expedient,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   surely there is not only a great deal to be said for it,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I suggest that there is a New Testament justification of it
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   in something that was done by the Apostles and Elders.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   You remember that last week we were discussing what happened at the Council of Jerusalem
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   as it is recorded in the 15th chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   And you remember the decision at which they arrived in that conference.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And the decision, you remember, was this.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   There was a very real problem.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   The Gentiles were coming in,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   there were the Judaizers who were saying, "They must all be circumcised,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   they must all go right back under the law."
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   "No," said this Council in its wisdom, "led by the Holy Ghost."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication."
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   They laid that down as a principle.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Now, that no longer applies to us.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   We don't abstain from blood in that sense.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   That was a decision for a period of transition, in order to avoid a clash.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   They said, "Look here, we will make it perfectly clear to the Gentiles that they do not have to come back under the law."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   "But in order to make it easier for the Jewish and the Gentile Christians to live together,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   we will appeal to the Gentiles to abstain from these particular things for the time being."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   And it was only for the time being.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Very well. I'm suggesting that Cranmer and others were partly motivated by the same sort of argument.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Here are the people so accustomed to this.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Well, let's not offend them unnecessarily.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Let's be clear about our great doctrine of salvation, but let's make this concession.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Go on using your liturgy.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Get rid of the Roman Catholic accretions and errors.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Make it a pure and true liturgy.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Very well, let's go on with that.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   It is a good temporary measure and expedient.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And I'm prepared to grant that as a temporary measure, it was justifiable.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Now, try and put your mind back into that 16th century.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   There was the great difficulty these men were confronted with.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   They were confronted by this ignorant populace, deeply prejudiced,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   that always done it like this.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Don't you say things like that sometimes?
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I hear that argument very frequently from people.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Not Anglicans, but Baptists and Methodists and others.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   "We've always done it like this. This is our father's."
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   People were like that then.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And you see, you've got to recognize that. You've got to meet that.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And there is nothing wrong in principle,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   in resorting to a temporary expedient or measure,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   when the thing is not concerning a vital, essential truth.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   It is a right principle that for the sake of brotherhood and friendship
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and the true unity of the spirit,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   that you make the kind of appeal and concession that was made by the council of Jerusalem.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And that is an argument, I say, for the prayer book in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   And it's still more in the reign of Henry VIII when it was first produced,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   and then in the reign of Edward VI.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   But I suggest that that is the most that can be said for it.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   That it was right then as a temporary measure,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   but it does not justify the perpetuation and the continuation of that forever and forever.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Very well, but that was the argument of people like Cranberry.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   But immediately there arose these others whom I've described as radical Puritans.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And they objected to this from the very beginning.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   They said, "No, that's all right, that's expedient."
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   But surely, they said, "We must be governed in these matters
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   by the teaching of the New Testament itself."
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Can we stop at only changing our view of the doctrine of salvation?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Surely, the New Testament teaches us also about the form of government in the church
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and about the form of worship.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   They said, "This thing is wrong.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   It's not consistent with the teaching of the New Testament."
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   They said, "We must carry the Reformation right through."
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   We don't stop at doctrines of salvation.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Be consistent. Carry it right through to the form of worship as well as the other matters.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And the fight began at once.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Some of you who have ever read of great men, John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   will know how he was one of the real leaders in all this,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and many others came after him.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And they claimed that they were just going back to the New Testament
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   and that everything that had been added on, quite unjustifiably,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   chiefly by the Church of Rome, must be undone and must be discarded.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Then you come on to the next century, to the great conference held here in Westminster Abbey,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   the famous Assembly of Divines, called in 1643.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   There was confusion in this country.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   It was partly political but very largely also religious.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And this question of the form of worship was one of the great questions.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   It wasn't only a question about bishops, but it was a whole question of the form of worship.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   The bishops were enforcing the use of the prayer book.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It had to be used, and everything else was being prohibited.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   So, with the political agitation and the war coming on, the war had already come on,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   and they decided that this Assembly of Divines should be called,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   and they met here in Westminster Abbey,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   and they produced the Westminster Confession of Faith,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   but accompanying it, a directory of worship.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Now, here's a very interesting matter in this whole connection.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You see, these men again, and the prevailing majority view, of course,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   that of the Church of Scotland, which was Presbyterian.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   They, and this is something again that isn't always realized,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   they, though they owed so much to John Calvin,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   they departed from his teaching at this point.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   They felt that there was need for the ministers to be helped and to be guided,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   but they did not agree with Calvin that you should have a stated liturgy
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and formal prayers which are to be repeated.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   What they said was this, "In this directory,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   we give you the subjects about which you should pray,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   and a general idea with regard to what you should pray for and how you should pray,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   but we don't give the words to you.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   We'll give you the lines, the headings."
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   In other words, they did precisely what I suggested in my interpretation of the Lord's Prayer,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   that our Lord himself was doing.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   When you pray, this is the way in which you should proceed.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   You start with worship and adoration, and you proceed.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   You must have order in your prayers.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   You mustn't just jump about from petition to petition.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Your prayers should be orderly.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   So the directory was concerned simply to introduce an element of order and of arrangement,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   indication of subjects in general, but certainly not a prescribing of exact words
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and an instruction that these words and no others should be prayed
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   and offered as petitions Sunday by Sunday, world without end.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Now that's the position of the Westminster Divines and their famous directory.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   This brings me to the end of my historical review, and I fear to the end of our meeting this evening,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   to what happened, of course, in 1662,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   when those 2,000 men were ejected out of their livings in the Church of England.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It was mainly over this one matter.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It wasn't primarily a matter of doctrine.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   It was this question of worship,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   the act of uniformity laid it down that they must use this prayer book which was produced at that time,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   which was a modification slightly of a previous one.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   This was the whole issue.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   They said that you must.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Now, remember, people like Richard Baxter and others who were ejected at that time,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Richard Baxter himself had no objection to a liturgy.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   In fact, he believed in a liturgy.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   But what he objected to was that it should be made compulsory,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and that unless a man did use it, he shouldn't be allowed to be a minister in the Church of England,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   and that he should not be allowed to offer his own extemporary prayers.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   It was this whole element of compulsion that really was the crux and the main issue in 1662.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Well, now then, we've got to leave it at that, I'm afraid, for this evening,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   and I hope to consider this further next Friday night.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   When I want now, in the light of all this,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   to consider with you the principles that should govern us in our thinking about this whole matter,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   we've got to get out of the atmosphere in which we say, "Ah, they're beautiful prayers,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   isn't the language perfect?" and so on, or some equal prejudice based on ignorance often
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   and sheer thoughtlessness on the other side.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   I suggest to you that there are certain very vital principles here.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   It isn't just enough that you react to the sight of those two men embracing one another or whatever they were doing.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   It isn't enough that you just react to that with violence and abhorrence,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   with which I am in great sympathy if I may say so,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   but we must have solid and scriptural grounds for saying, if that is what we do say,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   that that is not our idea of the worship of Christian people in the Church of God,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   as we see it in the New Testament, and as we would have it be,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   as we long to see it happening,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   and as we are prepared to pledge and commit ourselves to do everything we can to see that it is restored.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Well, may God bless us in the meantime and enable us to consider these matters in a spirit of humility and of prayer
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   in the light of the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   O Lord, our God, we come unto thee, and we are amazed more than ever that there is a Christian church at all.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   We see ourselves, we see other men and women in this age and in other ages.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   O God, we thank thee that what we do see clearly above all else is that the church is thine,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   and that she would have perished long ago were this not true.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Lord, we thank thee for thy great patience and longsuffering with us.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   And now again we yield and submit ourselves unto thee in the word of thy grace,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   praying that thou wouldst control us by it and lead us by it,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   and ever give us a single eye to thy glory and to thy praise.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Hear us, O Lord, as we come in the name of thy dear Son, our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Amen.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
