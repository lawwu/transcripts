[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   In the following sermon, which was preached on the 24th of December 1961,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.920]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching on the first chapter and the first verse
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.000]   of the Gospel of Matthew, the first words of the New Testament.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.320]   And therefore they are words obviously which have a special and an unusual significance.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.800]   Now here is therefore a very good way of approaching this whole question of Christmas,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.880]   of this special season, and of exactly what it means and represents to us.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   There are many ways of course in which this subject can be approached,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.240]   but I'm concerned in particular this morning to look at it with you in the light of this
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.680]   genealogical table, which is referred to here as the book of the generation
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.280]   of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.720]   And the question of course that must arise in our minds immediately is, why did the writer,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.680]   why did Matthew, trouble to give this list at all, what made him disposed to do so?
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   And what was the purpose and the object which he had in his mind when he introduced it in this way?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.920]   Well now I want to try to show you briefly that he did this because in many ways this
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.720]   does convey to us in this interesting manner what is after all the essence of the Christian message,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.880]   great fundamental principles of the Christian teaching, the Christian gospel,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.200]   are suggested to us immediately by this first verse and by the table which follows and which
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   we have read together just now. Now the first thing we have to remember is this, that this
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.640]   gospel according to St. Matthew was undoubtedly written primarily to the Jews.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.800]   We deduce that fact of course not only from this first verse but also from what is the outstanding
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   characteristic of this gospel, namely the frequency with which he refers to the Old Testament
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.160]   scriptures. He does it, you remember, we saw again towards the end of the chapter where he
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   gives this quotation, he says in verse 22, "Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.120]   which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying," and as you are familiar with this
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.880]   gospel you will recall that he keeps on doing that, he keeps on saying this happened in order
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.080]   that a certain scripture might be fulfilled. And that gives us the key to the understanding
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.200]   of the peculiar object and intention which Matthew had in writing this gospel.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   Now he did so, I say, with his eye primarily upon the Jews themselves, his own race,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.640]   his own people. And he did that of course for two main reasons. One was that he wanted to
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.560]   convey the gospel and its message to the Jews which still were not believing it.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.760]   The Jews were in difficulties about our law. You get that brought out very clearly again in
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles. The apostle Paul as a Jew himself not infrequently refers to
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   the same thing himself. We know that to the Jews this message of Jesus Christ and him crucified
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.760]   was a stumbling block. And it was a stumbling block for many reasons. They had their Old
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.200]   Testament scriptures and there there were prophecies concerning the coming Messiah.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.480]   Unfortunately they had misinterpreted many of them. They'd got certain prejudices and
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.920]   these prejudices had become hardened. And the result was that what they were expecting
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   was in so many ways different from the actual prophecies themselves in the Old Testament.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.360]   So obviously the first thing that any Jewish apologist has to do is to demonstrate that the
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   facts concerning the Lord Jesus Christ were perfectly in accord with everything that had
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   been written and had been prophesied in the Old Testament. And that is the thing that Matthew
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   sets out to do. And he announces it immediately in this first verse. He says this person, this Jesus,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   is both son of David and son of Abraham. If he couldn't establish those two things,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.720]   well then he couldn't even expect any Jew to believe in him as the long expected Messiah.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.680]   So you see he has that first object of commending the gospel and the truth
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.280]   concerning the Lord Jesus Christ to the Jews that are outside. And obviously at the same time
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   he was helping and assisting the Jews who had believed, but who now had to work this out for
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.480]   themselves and to fit it in. Now many of these had to do this. Indeed they all had to do it in a sense.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.920]   You will find in the last chapter of the gospel according to Saint Luke that our Lord himself
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.800]   after the resurrection expounded the truth concerning himself to the two men on the road
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.840]   to Emmanuel. They were dejected and unhappy and quest for him because our Lord had been crucified.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   And that didn't fit in with their idea of what the Messiah was to be. They were thinking of a
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.720]   great king, a great conqueror. But here was someone who had been crucified in weakness.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.120]   So he had to take them through the scriptures. And later on in the upper room we are told in
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.320]   that same last chapter of Luke's gospel that beginning at Moses he took them through the
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.800]   books of Moses and the Psalms and the prophets and expounded to them there all the things
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.880]   concerning himself. So it was necessary to help those believers amongst the Jews to see
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.800]   that everything that was being preached concerning the Lord Jesus Christ was indeed a fulfillment of
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.080]   their Old Testament scriptures. Well now there's the first thing, and it's a very important one.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.560]   And it's an important thing for us to remember. This is the way of all ways if you want to
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.960]   evangelize the Jews or to help members of that ancient race, the old people of God.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   This is something that is absolutely essential if you are to have any hope at all of bringing
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.560]   them to a knowledge of the truth. Well there's the first thing. I leave it at that.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.200]   Another thing obviously that Matthew is announcing here in the first verse is this,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.640]   that the whole of this message of Christianity is based upon and concerned with this person.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:32.160]   In other words, Christianity, as we must never cease to remember, is not just a teaching.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:42.080]   It isn't just a philosophy. It isn't merely an output. It is essentially a history concerning
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.880]   this particular person and the significance of the things that he did and the things
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.440]   that happened to him. Now we have to go on repeating this, and that is the one value in
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.000]   of observing Christmas Day. There have been times, as you know, when a certain of God's people
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.600]   objected to the whole notion of observing Christmas Day or even the Christmas season.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.920]   I believe they went too far. They did it as a reaction against Roman Catholicism
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.360]   and all its idea of the mass and all the wrong teaching that had come in.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.200]   But surely our forefathers went too far when they did away altogether with this separate observance.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   There are other people who are stumbled by the fact that it can't be established at all and
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.240]   probably is quite wrong to say that this particular date that we observe is the right one.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.560]   And because of that they don't observe it at all. Well, I believe they're equally foolish and
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:50.080]   equally wrong. What is important is this, is that we should all realize that on a given day, on a
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:59.040]   given date, this thing did happen. That this babe was born who was called Jesus and the truth
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:06.160]   concerning him. Now take away the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and you've got no Christianity.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.760]   You have no salvation. You can take away Buddha but you've still got Buddhism. You can take away
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.440]   Confucius but you've still got Confucianism and so on with all the other so-called religions,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   Mohammed and all the rest of them. They're not essential because it's the teaching that matters.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.320]   But here it's the other way around. There is no teaching apart from the person.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.640]   There is nothing at all apart from the facts which are described and recorded here in the pages of
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.800]   these Gospels. So it is essential, I say, that we should understand it so Matthew, without any
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.240]   introduction at all, just as it were, holds it at us, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:59.120]   Here's the person. Here's the center. Jesus Christ. So we are compelled to go back and to
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.560]   look at this person and to consider the facts concerning him. Now undoubtedly Matthew had that
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   second object in his mind in putting it before us in this particular way and manner. But of course
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.640]   we've got to go beyond that to this, to the significance of the fact. He's not merely
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:28.960]   recording a fact. He at once tells us that there are certain things about this fact which are of
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.720]   peculiar importance and significance to us. You see he says the book of the generation of Jesus
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.600]   Christ. But he doesn't stop there. The son of David, the son of Abraham. Now then, why does he
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:49.280]   add that? Why does he trouble to say son of David, son of Abraham? Here we come to the significance
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:58.320]   of the fact. And surely what he is concerned to say is this, that our Lord is not just some strange
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:08.880]   phenomenon. That he is not just something accidental. I mean this. In the history of
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   every nation, every race, every country, from time to time a certain striking person
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:26.160]   makes his appearance. Some outstanding genius, great thinker, great military personage,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:35.440]   great artist, great poet, great dramatist. Now every nation in its history has the record of
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:42.480]   some such kind of person suddenly thrown out. You can't explain it. His pedigree certainly
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:50.160]   doesn't explain it. Just thrown out, a kind of accident. What the biologists call a kind of spot,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.560]   something thrown out and you can't understand why it's happening. There is no reason. It
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.240]   isn't in a definite sequence. But it's just a strange phenomenon suddenly appearing.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:11.600]   And everybody is dumbfounded and amazed at it. Well now, what Matthew is concerned to do here
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.480]   is to show that that is not the truth concerning this person. However many who regarded it like
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   that, there was no question about the fact that this Jesus of Nazareth was a most extraordinary
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   and exceptional person. He was one born in great poverty, who never had any particular training,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.920]   certainly he was not trained as a Pharisee, had never been to any of the schools,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:44.240]   he just worked as an artist then, and yet he was quite unusual and exceptional as a teacher
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.960]   and as an instructor of the people. The problem was, how about this man learning, never having
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   learned? He was a phenomenon. And the danger was that he might be dismissed as a phenomenon,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.800]   just some strange religious genius thrown out without any background or any understanding
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:13.200]   at all. And the tendency of the Jews themselves and of the Romans in particular, was to regard him
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.680]   in some such way as that. But now Matthew is here immediately concerned to dispel any such notion,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:27.120]   and to show that that is not at all the truth concerning him. He is not an accident,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.040]   he is not just a phenomenon, he is not just something quite unforeseen and unexpected
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   taking place. It's quite the reverse. This person, Jesus Christ, is on the contrary
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:49.120]   the fulfillment of God's great purpose. Now that's the crucial thing that Matthew is
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.480]   emphasizing here, and it is the crucial thing, of course, in the message of the whole of the Bible.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:05.680]   Indeed, the whole Bible is concerned to do one thing, and that is, it is a record of God's plan
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.520]   and purpose. His plan and purpose in redemption. The Bible is the record of that and of its
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:22.080]   fulfillment. Now, we so often forget this. We get lost in the details, we get involved and immersed
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.840]   in the various movements that are recorded in the Bible. But it's a very good thing periodically,
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.120]   and at a time like this especially, to stand back as it were and take a kind of general
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.440]   conspectus of the whole of the Bible, every one of its books, and to ask ourselves,
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.200]   what is the message, what is the unifying principle that runs right through this great book?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:54.400]   And there it is, God's purpose, God's plan of redemption. That's the great business of the Bible.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.600]   It gives us a preliminary account of the creation of the world, but that's just in order, as it were,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.200]   to fill in the background. The real business of the Bible is not to give an account of creation
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:14.720]   or anything, but this, God's plan and purpose of redemption. God did create the world and all that
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:21.200]   is in it, all that is very important and essential, but the peculiar message is the history of
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.720]   redemption. And so he tells us that God had a great plan and a great purpose before the foundation
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:38.240]   of the world, to redeem men. And then he reveals it in parts and portions right through the Old
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.480]   Testament, and then suddenly here you come to the fulfillment of it all. That's the beginning
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   of the New Testament message. Well now, this then is the message of Christmas.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:59.920]   Here is the great fulfillment in time of the eternal purpose of God with regard to
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:07.360]   redemption and salvation. And I'm emphasizing it for this reason, that if that is not grasped,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   well then anything else you may say about Christmas is ultimately of no value at all.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:21.760]   And that is, of course, what so frequently happens, that people think of it as a season of good cheer,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   a season of hope, a season of love and of brotherhood and of friendship and so forth.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.720]   Now the world can do all that, and the world is doing all that, but that's not the Christian
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:41.040]   message. It's not some vague general message. No, no, it is this peculiar thing, that God has this
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:48.800]   great purpose, he had it before the foundation of the world, but here in time, the real vital
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   action in connection with it takes place. Now then, let's look at it like this.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:02.480]   Here I say something, that God announced way back at the very dawn and beginning.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.120]   Indeed, he announced it immediately after the fall of men.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:16.560]   Never forget that the gospel really begins in Genesis 3 15. That's sometimes called the
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:25.120]   protovangel, the protovangelion. It's a very good term. It is. It is the first declaration
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:32.400]   of the gospel. "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head." There's the beginning
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.080]   of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That's the beginning of Christianity.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.880]   That's why anybody who ignores the Old Testament is being very false to the teaching of the New
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:52.400]   Testament. God declared it at the beginning, and then he went on repeating it. Keep your eye on
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.640]   that always as you read your Old Testament. It keeps on repeating this original promise.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   Does it in different ways, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.720]   in diverse parts and portions, different ways, bits here and a bit there, a little bit of
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.480]   information added at one point, then another at another. But it's the same thing. It's this one
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:23.040]   great announcement that God is going to send deliverance, the seed of the woman.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.120]   There is this person to appear. And he goes on repeating it, reminding them of it. He repeats
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.560]   it to Abram, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to David, and so on, as we shall see. And what Matthew is
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:47.360]   saying is this. This person, Jesus Christ, is the fulfillment of all that. As the apostle Paul puts
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   it in writing his second epistle to the Corinthians, "All the promises of God are in him,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:01.600]   yea, and in him, amen, unto the glory of God." Now, this is a tremendous announcement.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   And this is Matthew's way of putting it. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David,
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.760]   son of Abraham. He's summing up the whole of your Old Testament just in those phrases.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:24.160]   And his announcement is that it is here that all this comes to focus. It is here that all this is
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:32.960]   really being harnessed to the human situation. If you like it in other language, this is Matthew's
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.800]   way of saying what the apostle Paul puts in Galatians 4, "For when the fullness of the times
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:47.840]   have come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.520]   under the law." Very well. Now, there is the first big thing. And to me, it's the most glorious thing
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.920]   of all. This is a part of this great purpose, and it's the crucial event in it all. But then we must
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.560]   go on and look at the particular significance, which he obviously is directing our attention to,
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:18.240]   in selecting these two phrases about son of David and son of Abraham. Why does he put it like this?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.120]   Why, I say, doesn't he just tell us in general that here is the fulfillment of the great
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.600]   prophecies of the past and the fulfillment of God's great purpose in time? Why son of David,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:39.040]   son of Abraham? And again, the Old Testament answers the question for us quite simply.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:48.480]   I have reminded you that God, having given the original promise and announcement way back even
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:54.960]   in the Garden of Eden itself, went on repeating it. In other words, he makes a covenant with men.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:01.760]   He binds himself to men. When he says, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head,"
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:08.960]   he is covenanting, he is coming to an agreement. He's pledging himself. But you will find that
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:17.680]   there are certain re-declarations of that original covenant that are particularly clear,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.160]   and particularly explicit. I have reminded you that he gave it many, many times to many,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.680]   many different people. But of all the restatements of the covenant of God with regard to redemption
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.280]   and salvation, there are two that are quite outstanding, and they are the two that are
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:44.720]   mentioned here by Matthew in this very first verse. Now, you must have noticed that many times as
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:51.600]   you've read the pages of these four Gospels, how our Lord was often addressed as "Son of David,"
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:58.560]   "Hail, Son of David." "Jesus, thou Son of David," said the blind men who wanted to be healed,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.840]   "have mercy upon me." Son of David. The Messiah, the Jews realized, was to be Son of David.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:14.080]   But he was equally meant to be Son of Abraham. And Matthew, therefore, takes up these two
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.920]   because of the particular clarity of the declaration of the covenant that was made
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:28.160]   with David and with Abraham as a part of a reminder of this original declaration.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:38.640]   And he asks us, therefore, to concentrate upon two aspects of the special work of our Lord and
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:45.040]   Savior Jesus Christ. Now then, here, if you like, is the Christian message, the Christmas message
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   also. Jesus Christ is the Son of David. What does that mean to us? Why should that cheer our hearts
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:00.240]   this morning? Why should that thrill us as it comes to us once more? Son of David. Well, let's
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:08.560]   go back and see what God promised David. How did God renew the covenant in particular to David?
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.840]   And you'll find the answer in the second book of Samuel, in chapter 7 and verse 16.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:23.200]   David, you remember, was anxious to build a house for God, a temple. And he was proposing to do so.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.560]   But he was told through the prophet Nathan that he was not to have that privilege,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.800]   that he'd been a man of war and therefore he couldn't have the privilege,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.960]   but that the privilege should be given to his son.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:43.760]   Nevertheless, God, in order to comfort David, his servant, renewed the covenant and put it in this
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.360]   form. He said, "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:58.800]   Thy throne shall be established forever." Now, there is the peculiar promise that was given to
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:06.880]   David, that out of his lines should come a seed that should always reign, that it was his seed
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.040]   that should be the universal ruler and king eternal, that they should never be lacking
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.040]   a descendant of David upon the throne. Now, this is something, therefore, which was of great
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.480]   significance to the children of Israel ever after. Isaiah, for instance, takes it up in the 11th
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.560]   chapter of his prophecy, and in the first verse he puts it like this, "And there shall come forth
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:42.000]   a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots." Now, keep your eye on that
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.240]   always as you read the Bible, "a rod out of the stem of Jesse." Jesse was the father of David,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.160]   as you remember we are told here. And this is the great promise Isaiah, in describing the Messiah
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.040]   in that 11th chapter, starts off by this declaration about him. He's going to be wonderful
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.920]   and great, having the spirit of wisdom and so on. Yes, but he comes out of the stem, the rod,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:12.560]   the root of Jesse. He is to be son of David, who was son of Jesse. And you remember how Paul,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.320]   in writing his epistle to the Romans, is very careful to remind us right away at the beginning,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.520]   in the fourth verse of the first chapter, that this gospel is concerning Jesus Christ, who was
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.360]   born of the seed of David according to the flesh, but declared to be the son of God with power
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.480]   according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead. But here, according
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.040]   to the flesh, the apostle reminds us that he was of the seed of David according to the flesh.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.240]   Well, now then, you see Matthew's purpose. He is anxious, as I've reminded you in the first place,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.520]   to show the fulfillment of the prophecies, to show that Jesus Christ is literally this person
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   that had been foretold, that he is the answer to all these questions, that he is the fulfillment
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:06.240]   of all these promises. He is the person. Here is the purpose of God, but it has this special meaning.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:15.680]   The promise was that David's posterity should continue on the throne and on the kingdom,
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.520]   and that he should rule forever. Now, that's the promise, and this is the thing of which
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.240]   we are reminded here. The Lord Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of that.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.960]   Do you remember how the archangel Gabriel, who was sent to Mary to announce the birth of this child,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.920]   laid great stress and emphasis upon the same thing? Listen to it.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.360]   "The angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God." I'm reading out
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:53.680]   of the first chapter of Luke's gospel, beginning at verse 30. "And behold, thou shalt conceive in
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:01.600]   thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:09.840]   called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:21.600]   And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.400]   Now, that's a great promise that you'll find repeated constantly in the pages of the Old
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.840]   Testament. And there it is announced to Mary, even at the very beginning, that the son that
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.120]   she's going to give birth to is going to be this son of David, great David's greater son,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.240]   who is going to reign forever and forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:54.720]   Now, here's the promise. Israel was looking for this leader, this king, this one who was to reign
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   over God's people. And what Matthew is announcing here in this extraordinary way is that he's come.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.240]   "Here is the king of Israel, indeed more. Here is the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.400]   Here is the one whose kingdom shall never come to an end. It shall be everlasting and eternal."
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:23.680]   Well, there's nothing more interesting and fascinating and more thrilling than to work
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.560]   out this as it's taught everywhere in the Bible. You remember Daniel teaching it in the second
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:36.320]   chapter of his prophecy. He gives us this picture of these great kingdoms that are going to rise up,
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:45.360]   one after another, with their might and their power. Gold and silver and brass and iron and
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:54.000]   clay mixed, these great dynasties. The Chaldean, the Medo-Persians, the Greeks, the Romans,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.800]   these mighty empires, these great emperors and rulers who are going to subjugate the whole world
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.640]   as it were, and are going to reign and appear to be invincible. But they all come to an end,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.960]   and they all are conquered and they're replaced by something else. But this is the significant
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:21.440]   teaching. In the vision, suddenly there is seen a stone cut without ends, suddenly appearing.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.960]   No gold, no brass, no silver, no iron, but a stone, something that appears to be very ordinary
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.520]   and very common. And there it just appears without ends. It isn't cut out, it isn't quarried out of
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.600]   some great quarry. It just appears. You see a perfect representation of the lowly, unexpected
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:47.040]   manner of our Lord's birth and upbringing and so on. But this is the thing. This stone grows and
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.920]   it becomes a mountain. And it smites this great image of wealthy rule and power and authority
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:00.720]   until it's all smashed and destroyed. And it becomes a great mountain that fills the entire
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   world. Son of David, Jesus Christ, Son of David. And here it seems to me is the very special message
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:18.880]   of Christmas, particularly this year. Here is the conqueror renowned. Here is the King of kings
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:28.400]   and the Lord of lords. Here is one who is conquering and to conquer. Here is one of whose
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.880]   kingdom there is never to be any end. And this is the comfort, this is the consolation.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.520]   Though things may seem to be going the other way, this is the answer.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:46.240]   Though the kingdoms of the world may be raising themselves up, though men in his pride and
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.360]   arrogance seems to be ruling over all, it is certain that this kingdom is going to destroy
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:31:00.160]   all kingdoms. And that Jesus shall reign where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run. Why?
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.360]   Well, he's son of David. The promise to David is fulfilled in him. Of his kingdom there shall be
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:13.280]   no end. And so you see, when you read the fifth chapter of the book of Revelation and begin to
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.720]   look at the scroll containing the whole history of the world, the scroll that was sealed with
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.600]   those seals and nobody in heaven or earth or anywhere else could open it, no one was strong
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:32.480]   enough to be the master of history. Suddenly, the Lion of the tribe of Judah appears. Same person,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.800]   son of David, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Yes, he is as a lamb slain because he was
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:45.840]   crucified. Nevertheless, he's the Lion, he's the King. So while it is right that we should think
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:53.760]   of him as the Carols lead us to do, as the child and the babe of Bethlehem, we must never forget
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:02.640]   that that child is the King. That child is going to be the conqueror renowned. This child is the
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.400]   one who's to reign from pole to pole. This is the one who's going to rule with a rod of iron,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.680]   and who therefore stands above all the nations and leads the second psalm to say,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:21.920]   "Kiss the sun while there's yet time." Here's the message. Son of David, and because he's son of
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:29.040]   David, he is the King of kings, he is the Lord of lords. There shall be no end to his kingdom.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.640]   He will come again into this world and destroy his every enemy, set up his glorious kingdom,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   and reign and rule over all. Son of David. How vital it is that we should remember that. Is
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.400]   there anything, I ask, which is more comforting and consoling at this particular juncture in the
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.640]   history of the human race than just this thought? But let me hurry to the second.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:33:00.880]   He is not only son of David, but he is son of Abraham also. He traces him yet further back.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:08.400]   Why does he mention this? Well, here again, you've only to go back to your Old Testament
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:17.040]   to discover the answer. The first and most explicit restatement of the original covenant
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:24.880]   was the one that was made with Abraham. It is there the peculiar history of the children of
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.200]   Israel really begins, as you remember. God calls this man Abraham, brought up amongst the pagans,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   gives him his message, sends him to the land of promise.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:42.400]   And then, at a moment when Abraham was very depressed, God renewed the covenant, and this
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:52.320]   is what he said, that he would make him a father of many nations, and that in him and in his seed
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:00.080]   should all the nations of the earth be blessed. Now, that was a most astounding thing to say.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.760]   The promise to Abraham was not only that he should have this great progeny,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.360]   not merely that he should have the land of promise. There was something much bigger,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:18.800]   and that was this strange promise, that in and through him and his seed, that all the nations
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.440]   of the earth should be blessed, that somehow or another, out of Abraham should come the one
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.760]   who should be the blessing to all the nations of the earth. And what Matthew is announcing
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:38.000]   is that this Jesus Christ is the one in whom all that is fulfilled.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.480]   Now, this is not a promise so much of the kingly reign,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.320]   that was the promise to David, but here is the promise of salvation.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:55.440]   The world needs salvation. Men and women need to be delivered from the bondage and the captivity
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.680]   of sin. So, Matthew reminds us that this one person is not only the one who is going to reign
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:09.200]   over all, and in whose hands the whole of history rests, but he is also the one through whom
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.600]   salvation comes, and through whom alone it comes. Listen to the apostle Paul expounding this
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:26.800]   in Galatians 3.16. Now he says to Abraham, "And his seed, where the promise is made,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:39.120]   he saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, unto thy seed, which is Christ."
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:45.920]   Now, that is the finest commentary you can ever have upon this first verse in the New Testament.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:56.000]   Jesus Christ is the son of Abraham. In other words, he is the seed of Abraham.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:04.560]   The world is not saved by the Jewish nation. The world is not saved by the nation of Israel.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:12.720]   It is not seeds, plural. It is seed, singular, as of one, and this one is Jesus Christ.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.920]   So, in other words, we are being told here that in this one person, in this babe that was born
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:26.480]   in Bethlehem, God is fulfilling that great covenant promise made to Abraham. Here is the seed through
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.920]   whom all the nations of the earth are going to be blessed, in whom and in whom alone they shall find
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:41.120]   salvation. And that is why the great apostle in that same epistle to the Galatians puts it like
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:48.240]   this, that there is no longer Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free, male nor
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:55.520]   female. It is all who are in Christ. The message is no longer confined to the Jews. It is to all
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:03.040]   nations. Here is the one, son of Abraham, through whom deliverance and blessing are going to come
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:11.520]   to all the nations of the earth. So, you see why Matthew puts it as he does in this first verse
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.880]   of his gospel, the first verse in the New Testament, the first statement concerning
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:23.760]   the gospel of Christ and of salvation. This is what we need. We need salvation. We need
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.520]   reconciliation with God. Here it is, and here alone, in this one person. Here is the seed of
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:35.120]   Abraham, long since promised. It is through him that God is going to bless all the nations of
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:42.880]   the earth. And having reconciled us to God, he will deliver us from all our enemies.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   And ultimately, he will bring in his glorious and everlasting kingdom, and we who belong to him and
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.760]   who are saved by him shall be in it with him and reign forever and forever. Now, that is the essence
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:06.560]   of the message. But let us just, in a closing word, deduce certain things to ourselves from
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:14.320]   this great and glorious message. What does Christmas mean to you, my friend? Do you allow
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.560]   the world to govern your thoughts concerning it? What does it really tell you? What is the comfort
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.360]   and the encouragement of this day and of this season and of this message? Well, let me just
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:33.280]   summarize them. Here is the first. God's promises are always sure. Always.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:43.040]   Babe has been born. Who is he? Son of David. Fulfillment of the promise made to David. Son
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:50.640]   of Abraham, further back. Fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham. God's promises are
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.960]   always sure. They never fail. They never have. They never will. They never can.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.840]   It is all here. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.000]   It has come to pass. It is all fulfilled.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.320]   I needn't stay to work them out in detail with you, but let's never forget this.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.560]   There are many particular personal promises given to us in the scriptures.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:28.160]   Believe them, every one of them. They're all true. You're told the very hairs of your head
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.520]   are all numbered if you're a child of God. Well, don't forget it, my friend. Whatever
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.160]   your circumstances are this morning, God's promises are always true. They're never broken.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.040]   He has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Remember it. He never will.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:49.280]   He'll always be with you. You may not realize it, but he's there. His promises are always fulfilled.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   Let's decide to go again through our scriptures,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.920]   picking out these exceeding great and precious promises, and let's remember that every one of
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:09.520]   them is true. Wherever you are, in the fire or the water, he says he'll be a husband to the widow,
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:16.000]   a father to the orphans. It's true. Believe it. As he fulfilled this greatest of all his promises,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.440]   he'll fulfill every one of them. He's God. He cannot lie.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.360]   Here's the message of Christmas to us. God always keeps his promises.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.040]   But not only these particular personal promises, these larger promises of his,
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.400]   I've already been hinting at that and suggesting it,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:43.520]   and I know of no other consolation this morning with the world as it is. But here it is.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:49.360]   There are promises of God with respect to the future.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   And as he has carried out his promises in the past, as those ancient promises were fulfilled
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.120]   in the first advent of the Son of God, so all the other promises
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.000]   about the second advent shall be equally certainly fulfilled, every one of them.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.120]   When the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.440]   made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. It happened, yes. And when the
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.160]   fullness of the times shall come again, that hour, that day, that none knoweth but God,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:33.600]   he'll come again. Whatever may be happening in the world, God's promises will be fulfilled.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:41.760]   His purposes can never be frustrated. There is nothing that can stand between God and the final
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.720]   outworking of everything that he purposed with regard to this world before the foundation of
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:53.040]   the world. You know it's as special as this. There is a fullness of the Gentiles to come
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.520]   into the kingdom of God, and every one of them will come in. There won't be a single one left
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.080]   outside that is meant to come in. The fullness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and all Israel
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.400]   shall be saved. There'll not be a single person missing that was meant to be saved.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.520]   What God has purposed, what God has promised, will certainly be brought to pass.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:23.280]   And though the world is scoffing at Christ and Christianity today, and just takes this great
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:31.520]   season and turns it into a drunken orgy, this still remains. He will come, King of kings,
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:38.160]   Lord of lords, riding the crowds of heaven surrounded by his holy angels, and he will
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.680]   judge and destroy the whole of his enemies, and he will bring in the regeneration,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.040]   and he will rule and reign over all. It's certain.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:58.320]   Son of David, son of Abraham, the old promises have all been fulfilled. And my final word is
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:06.800]   this, just a comment. Were you struck as we read the genealogical table at the strange way in which
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:17.200]   God fulfills his promises sometimes? It takes a long time, doesn't it, sometimes? Listen to the
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:24.800]   way in which Matthew puts it. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.880]   generations. It's a long time, but he didn't come even then. And from David until the carrying away
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:37.360]   into Babylon are fourteen generations, a very long time. And from the carrying away into Babylon
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:47.200]   unto Christ are fourteen generations. Forty-two long generations. What an awful long time.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:56.160]   Doesn't matter. He did come. With God a thousand years, or as one day and one day as a thousand
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:04.000]   years. We attempted to cry, "How long, O Lord? Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has God forgotten
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.320]   his promises? Look what's happening in the world," we say. "Look at the church going down and the
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   enemy rising. How long?" It's all right, my friend. God is outside time. And what appears to you and
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:24.400]   to me to be a very long time is nothing in the eyes of God. Don't be deluded by the devil. Don't
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   let him mislead you. Don't be misled by this time element. It may be very, very long. I don't know.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.320]   All I do know is that it's going to happen, that it's absolutely certain.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.160]   But still more extraordinary is this.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:52.480]   "And Judas begett fairies, and Zarah of Tamar." Did you notice that? And did you
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:59.040]   notice that's verse 3. This is verse 6. "And Jesse beget David the king, and David the king
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:09.600]   beget Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Uriah." Do you remember the significance?
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:19.760]   Read your Old Testament. "Judas beget fairies, and Zarah of Tamar." Yes, but she wasn't his wife.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:28.640]   She was playing the concubine for the moment. But nevertheless, that was a part of the line.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:37.920]   God overruled to bring his great purpose to pass. "Jesse beget David the king,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.280]   and David the king beget Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Uriah." Yes,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:50.800]   she was the wife of Uriah. But David committed his greatest crime and his greatest sin.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:46:01.200]   Why? He took Bathsheba, he murdered her husband, and of that union which was so illicit,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   it was born Solomon. But he's a part of God's plan and of God's purpose. What's it mean? It means
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:18.640]   this. God to bring his great purposes to pass even overruled sin. It's amazing, it's extraordinary.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.520]   Don't try to understand it, it's beyond understanding. He can overrule sin of the
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.880]   foulest, the deepest dye. Here it is in the genealogical table. God in his love and his
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.320]   almighty power can take two actions such as these and turn them and transmute them
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:43.840]   into a glorious part and portion of his eternal and almighty plan and purpose.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:51.920]   Thank God he still does this and he can still do it. He can even make use of our transgressions
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.360]   and sins to bless us in a manner that we cannot understand. Don't trade on this.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.880]   This is the mercy and the glory of God. This is his reigning and ruling over all, but he does it.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:11.120]   Let's be careful, my friends, lest we judge one another wrongly, lest we despise any.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.320]   Not only from the most lowly circumstances does his son appear, out of sin as it were,
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:30.640]   he brings him forth. God is so great and almighty and eternal that he causes all things without any
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:39.920]   limit to work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:46.160]   purpose. Very well, let us meditate upon these things today and tomorrow and during this season
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.640]   and let us rejoice that God hath visited and hath redeemed his people. The beginning,
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.720]   the genealogy, the beginning of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham,
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:10.560]   the purposes of God are always sure. A glorious age is coming, the age of the Son of God in all
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:24.240]   his glory. Amen. Now shall we join in singing hymn number 326. We'll omit verses 2 and 4.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:33.440]   Omitting verses 2 and 4, hymn number 326. Hail to the Lord's anointed, great David's greater son.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.640]   326.
