[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   All right, let's roll on.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.520]   What do we have next?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.760]   Next question, Dave from DC.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.640]   I work at a research center where everybody wears a lot of different hats and projects
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.360]   are usually short term, usually six months.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   And most of us are on a couple at a time.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.120]   We have been given lots of tools to navigate through this email, Jabber, like instant messenger,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.220]   Mattermost, open source, Slack, Zoom, and our newest addition, Slack.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880]   My supervisor read your book and then asked if any would like to make a communication
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.720]   policy document to lay out the ground rules on what a communication happens on what platform
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.200]   so we don't get overloaded.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.260]   I stepped up to make the first cut.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.260]   Any suggestions?
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.560]   I thought this was relevant to today's topic because communication plays such a big role
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.800]   in the impact of overhead.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.220]   And I mentioned one of the two ways for us to tame overload is to tame the way that overhead
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.280]   coordination, the overhead made up of coordination collaboration, how that unfolds.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.860]   If we could tame how that coordination collaboration occurs so it doesn't spread out so much over
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.080]   so much of your schedule, that would help the overload issue.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.500]   So writing a communication plan for your company or team could be a good way of reducing the
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.520]   footprint of necessary coordination and collaboration.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.880]   So Dave, I'm glad you took on this challenge.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.800]   Here's some random thoughts off the top of my head.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.380]   All right, if I was writing one of these things, I would say number one, email is for the following
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.020]   purposes, announcing information that does not require a reply, non-urgent questions
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.340]   that can be answered with a single reply.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.300]   Hey, can you remind me what time this is at?
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.380]   Are you coming to this event next week?
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.140]   I didn't get your RSVP.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.300]   Can you remind me which folder we were putting these files in?
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.580]   Email can also be used for delivering files or other types of content.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.460]   So you wanted this contract, I attached it to this message, here you go.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.460]   Keep email for those things.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.300]   Anything that requires back and forth interaction.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.460]   So beyond just answering a single question, this should be done synchronously, real time,
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.740]   we can just talk back and forth to each other in real time.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.180]   Where should these interactions occur?
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.540]   One option, number one should be office hours.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.140]   Everyone has office hours most days, maybe multiple times a day on some days a week.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740]   Well publicized when your office hours are.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.580]   This is the default.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.160]   If I have something I need to talk to you about that would require more than one back
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.980]   and forth, I will come to your next office hours and we can just talk about it.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.380]   I don't care what medium you use to interact during office hours.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.140]   It could be in person in the office, it could be on the phone, it could be on Zoom, you
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.860]   could just have a Zoom office with the office hours feature with the waiting room open.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.940]   It could be on Slack, I think it's completely fine to have an office hours channel on Slack
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.260]   where people could just come and start slacking you go.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.620]   The key is you want real time synchronous during those set hours.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.900]   If the interaction requires multiple people, so you're about to use that CC button, you
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.700]   should have regularly scheduled docket clearing meetings for your team probably twice a week.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.540]   There should be a shared document that accompanies these meetings.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.260]   Throughout the week in between the docket clearing, if something comes up that needs
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.560]   to be discussed as a group, you add it to the shared document.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.060]   When you get to the next docket clearing meeting, you look at the shared document as a group
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.560]   and you go through it piece by piece and try to tackle each of the items.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.140]   So this could be a big discussion, we need to figure out a new strategy, or it could
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.620]   be a scheduling decision.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.180]   We need to set up a strategy off site meeting when is good.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.860]   Let me type that in our shared document at the next docket clearing meeting, there will
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.540]   be a point where we get to that we say, Okay, everyone, open up your calendars.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.560]   Let's find a time right now.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.580]   So if you need a seat, you would have used a CC message for that has multiple back and
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.740]   forth.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.060]   Wait till the next regularly scheduled docket clearing meeting.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.620]   If all else fails, then you can go to the custom scheduled meeting.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.420]   All right, you and I have to just set up a meeting to talk about this.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.420]   We can't do it in office hours for whatever reason.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.700]   We can't do it in docket clearing.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.760]   Only then do you fall back on a normally scheduled meeting.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.500]   You need some sort of automated process for setting up meetings.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.700]   So either you can expose calendars with available times or just keep I like this method, a text
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.420]   file of available meeting times for the next few weeks.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.380]   And you just email that to the person if they select one, you schedule that and take it
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.380]   off the list.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.060]   It gives you more control.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.620]   And it prevents the person you're talking to to having to go to a third party app.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.020]   So I like that method as well.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.140]   But if you're going to schedule a custom meeting that to can't require more than one message
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   in a reply.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.160]   So we're never doing multiple back and forth over email.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.060]   We're never doing unscheduled slack.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.540]   Everything happens during a planned time.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.920]   The custom scheduled meetings will be rare.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.580]   If you have regular office hours and docket clearing meetings that will cover 80% of what
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.820]   might have been a meeting otherwise, and it leaves the meetings that remain to be quite
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.820]   reasonable.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.460]   I would also recommend in the shared communication document that shared documents and folders
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.820]   are heavily used to collect information that needs to be accessed or updated by multiple
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.020]   people.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.300]   Never ever ever use your email as a knowledge management system.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.260]   Everything goes to a shared document that you can point people to that people can edit
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.920]   and leave comments.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.260]   Other people can come and check.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.180]   So that technology should be used a lot as well.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.580]   Do those things.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.940]   Dave from DC put that in your communication policy, you are going to see the footprint
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.980]   of the necessary overhead, this communication, the coordination collaboration is going to
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.620]   plummet and is going to make the same amount of execution require a lot less time and none
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.720]   of these tools, nothing here is a fancy tool.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.320]   Nothing here is you need some whatever you said Jabber or matter most, you don't need
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   anything complicated.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.460]   You can implement these with the simplest Google workspace, whatever tools, that's not
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.460]   the issue.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.740]   The issue is the processes that surround them.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.740]   So there you go.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.180]   That's my rough draft of a communication policy.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.680]   (upbeat music)
