[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hi Cal, this is Omar Ansari. Hope you're doing well.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   So I love your book and I've got the whole team reading it and we've even started a book club at work.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I was reviewing your first principle and it talked about eudaimonia machines.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And you know, the thought occurred to me, these are five rooms and what if we were to transplant these concepts,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   these five different stages into weekdays?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And the thought occurs to me because at work we've instituted this no meeting Friday approach.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So we literally have created this space for folks to have deep work.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I'm wondering if we can actually step through the five stages in a chunk like fashion.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   This is what we need to work with those three 90 minute sessions on Friday and we build Monday through Thursday to that day.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So I was wondering if you have any thoughts around that approach and any ideas.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Thank you so much and keep up the good work.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Well Omar, first of all, I appreciate the bird sounds in the background.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   From best I can tell remotely, it seems like a flock of birds was murdering a deer.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Do I have that right? Or maybe it was a flock of birds was repairing a motorcycle.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But anyways, you brought the bird sound commitment up to a new level.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So I do applaud you for that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   All right, so let's talk about the eudaimonia machine.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Architect David DeWayne's idea of the eudaimonia machine.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I was actually just talking to David earlier today.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   He sent me a really cool Emerson quote that I might do something with.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Can we move the eudaimonia machine from spatial to temporal?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Can we move the rooms of the eudaimonia machine into days of the week?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I will say my first instinct here is caution.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   If you do, and I'm going to use your example,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   if you do something like no meeting Friday,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   these have been tried a lot and they failed a lot.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And why do they fail a lot is if you have not fixed the underlying nature of your work
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   to make that possible, it's going to create problems.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And what I mean by that more specifically is if like most organizations,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   you use the hyperactive hive mind workflow as your primary means of coordination
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and collaborations that's on the fly, ad hoc, back and forth, haphazard communication.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   This is how we make things happen.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   When you then try to put in these bigger constraints, such as, you know,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   on Friday, we don't do meetings. On Tuesdays, we don't send emails.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It can cause issues because it's actually these impromptu emails and meetings
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   that makes progress in the work and the work slows down and things can't happen
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and the friction builds up and the heat gets hot and then the constraints go away.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So what I recommend is if you're going to do any type of shaping,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   temporal shaping of how work unfolds, when communication happens,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   when meetings happen, when emails happen,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   the rules have to be supported by underlying processes.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You have to have an alternative way for work to happen that's clearly specified
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   that works just fine if no one has meetings on Friday
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   or if no one can send emails on Tuesday.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So this is my concern when I hear just a casual idea of like, well,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   we could take something like the rooms of the Eudaimonia machine
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and make them in the days because that's putting huge constraints
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   on what is allowed to happen in different days.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And those constraints will fail if you don't rethink from the ground up
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   how work actually happens so that they can fit within those constraints.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And that's a big point that I want to put out there in my answer
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   is that the processes for work drive everything else.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   You cannot solve the problems that are created as a side effect
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   of the hyperactive hive mind by just treating those side effects.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You can't say, man, we get too many emails,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   so let's put a rule that says let's send less emails.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   You can't say, man, we're in so many Zoom meetings,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   let's have a rule that says less Zoom meetings.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   You're treating the fever without getting to the underlying infection.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   In this case, the underlying infection is these haphazard back and forth
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   on-demand communication sessions are the only way that you have
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   in your organization to get work done.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So I care more about the underlying processes than the rules you have
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   for how many meetings we can have, email, et cetera.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   That being said, I do like the general idea of finding different ways
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   of operationalizing the philosophy that is embedded
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in David DeWayne's eudaimonia machine.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   The machine is a concrete proposal.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's also a philosophical proposal.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   The idea that you could actually think intentionally
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   about how you actually approach the task of creating value
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   with your brain and taking the function of the brain
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and the human being as an integral part of your thinking
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   about work phase construction.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   When David talks about having a shower you go through ritualistically
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   before you go into a chamber to really think your deepest thoughts,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   this is in part a philosophical acceptance of this is a really complicated,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   interesting, deeply human thing we're asking people to do,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and we should maybe give it some ritualistic respect.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I think more vaguely this is a good idea, that we should have more respect
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   in how we construct our workdays to actually respect how human beings function
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and what we're asking human beings to do and how the human brains
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   actually operate and what's a good or bad way to work with these brains.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Maybe to add a little bit more of mystery into what we're doing,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to add a little bit more of a code of honor into thinking
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   or whatever we want to do.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I think this is not a bad idea.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   But just keep in mind, again, the scale at which these changes
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   have to operate is on the underlying processes for how work gets done.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Jumping on Slack, jumping on email, or sending out Google invites for a Zoom,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   if this is the primary way that almost all work gets done,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   you can't have much success making any other changes.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   So if you start with the processes, you can re-mold your work however you want.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You can make your own instantiations of the eudaimonia machine,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   of radical novelty, of radical effectiveness, whatever you want to do,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   if you're starting your work from the underlying processes
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and rebuilding those from scratch to directly support whatever this vision actually is.
