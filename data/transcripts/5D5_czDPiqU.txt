[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Michaela writes in to ask this,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.320]   "Pastor John, in episode number 19,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.720]   "you said God sometimes withdraws his presence from us.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.420]   "How does that not contradict God's new covenant promise
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.060]   "to never leave us or forsake us?"
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.800]   In Hebrews 13, verse five.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.480]   - I love that kind of question because to me,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.660]   the best questions are how things fit together.
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.440]   What's helped me most, I think, in my study of the Bible
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   is seeing when things seem not to fit together,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.960]   seem contradictory, and then instead of walking away
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   from the Bible and assuming, well, it's a bunch of
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   double talk, digging down to the root
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   so they come together and then you realize,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.840]   oh, these two plants are not opposites.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.880]   They have the same roots.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   So I think that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   So we need to think about kinds of presence of the Lord.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.780]   The Bible talks about different kinds of his presence.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.420]   So for example, most of us would agree
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.720]   that God is omnipresent.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.260]   There's no place where he's not.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.540]   Paul said, "In him we live and move and have our being."
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.060]   He's just quoting a pagan poet there to agree that yes,
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.880]   everybody is in God, held in being by God.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   And Jeremiah in 23, 24 says, "Can a man hide himself
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.080]   "in secret places so that I cannot see him?"
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.180]   God is talking.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.880]   "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" declares the Lord.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.280]   So I think the first and most basic sense
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.240]   that we need to talk about is he's everywhere.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.020]   God is omnipresent, including in the lives of believers
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.960]   and unbelievers, holding them in being,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.760]   knowing all that they do firsthand.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.180]   And then Michaela points to, and she's absolutely right,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.820]   there is this special presence.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.020]   She calls it the new covenant promise of God's presence
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.860]   in Hebrews 13, five, which says,
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.100]   "Keep your life free from the love of money
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.820]   "and be content with what you have,
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.820]   "for he has said, 'I will never leave you or forsake you.'"
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.860]   Or we could go to Matthew 28,
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.700]   "Behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940]   Or we could go to 2 Corinthians 4,
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.940]   "I am persecuted but not forsaken."
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980]   So you've got these New Testament, new covenant promises.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.980]   God is never, ever going to abandon or leave his people.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   The one I love most is Jeremiah 32, 40,
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.400]   where it goes over the top and says,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.740]   "I will make with them an everlasting covenant,"
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.080]   this is now the new covenant,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.340]   "that I will not turn away from doing good to them."
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.400]   And then he adds, "And I will put the fear of me
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.740]   "in their hearts so they may not turn from me."
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.460]   So this new covenant promise is not only
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.260]   that God won't walk away from us,
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.740]   he won't let us walk away from him.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.980]   So I wanna say to Michaela, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.980]   She's right that there is a presence of God,
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.700]   a keeping, a staying with,
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.140]   that will never fail for God's elect,
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.420]   for those who are in Christ.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.180]   But, now here's what she picked up on.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.220]   There is another way in the Bible
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.020]   that it talks about the presence of God.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.020]   So Psalm 69, 17, "Hide not your face from your servant,
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.400]   "for I am in distress.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   "Make haste to answer me."
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.480]   So his sense is God is distant, God is hiding from him.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.220]   Or Psalm 143, 7, "Answer me quickly, O Lord.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.640]   "My spirit fails.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.540]   "Hide not your face from me,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.100]   "lest I be like those who go down to the pit."
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.000]   Or Isaiah 64, 7, "There is no one who calls upon your name,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.120]   "who rouses himself to take hold of you,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.220]   "for you have hidden your face from us,"
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.780]   us, your covenant people,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.280]   "and have made us melt in the hand of your iniquities."
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.820]   Now, what occurs to me when I read these
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.700]   is that Michaela might say, others might say,
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.000]   "Wait a minute, those are Old Testament prayers.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.780]   "Maybe the saints had to pray like that in the Old Testament.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.020]   "Don't hide your face from me, don't go away from me.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.020]   "But we're new covenant people.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.540]   "Would we ever pray like that?"
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.260]   And there are a couple of problems with that objection.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260]   One is that in the very text that Michaela quoted,
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.920]   from Hebrews 13, 5, where it says,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.460]   "The Lord has said, I will be with you,
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.460]   "I will not leave you," that's a quote from Joshua 1, 5.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.420]   So he's quoting an Old Covenant promise
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.300]   and applying it to New Testament believers.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.180]   And the other problem is that the Old Testament
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.260]   abounds with promises to God's people
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.220]   that he won't forsake them.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.660]   First Samuel 12, 22,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.120]   "The Lord will not forsake his people
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.500]   "for his great namesake."
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.540]   Psalm 37, 28, "The Lord loves justice.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.480]   "He will not forsake his saints."
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.180]   Psalm 23, 4, we all love Psalm 23,
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.660]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.880]   "of death, I fear no evil 'cause you're with me."
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.520]   In other words, even in the worst of horrible, dark times,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.080]   "My shepherd is with me."
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.140]   Those are Old Testament statements.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.420]   So here's my answer to her question.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.020]   The old Puritans put it all together
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.020]   by talking about the manifest presence of God.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.700]   And they were using that phrase manifest,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.700]   experienced, known, tasted presence of God
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.340]   to distinguish it from the omnipresence of God
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.380]   and from the covenant keeping of God,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.900]   which may or may not be experienced intensely
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.940]   from time to time.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.140]   And I think this is really, really helpful.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.140]   In other words, sometimes God withdraws his presence from us.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.220]   That's the phrase, that's the statement I made
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.580]   that Michaela stumbled over.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.460]   She said, "How can that be?"
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.620]   When I say that, sometimes God withdraws
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.020]   his presence from us.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.020]   I don't mean that we are forsaken by our covenant God.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.300]   I mean that the manifestations of his presence are limited.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.420]   He doesn't withdraw his covenant commitment to us
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.220]   or his sustaining grace from us.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.380]   What he withdraws is the sweetness of his fellowship
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.260]   from time to time or the conscious sense of his power.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.940]   And he has his reasons for doing this.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.420]   And I think maybe that would be another time
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.500]   for us to talk about that.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   But surely one of them is to make us feel
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.460]   our desperate need from him so that we fly to Christ
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.700]   and to the cross where we hear
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.180]   the covenant promise afresh.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.100]   - Yes, amen.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.420]   And thank you, Michaela, for your question.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.460]   She was asking a follow-up question to episode number 19,
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.260]   does God ever withdraw his presence from his children?
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.500]   You can find that episode in the Ask Pastor John archive.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.100]   And if you have a question on the brain
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.340]   that you'd like to ask Pastor John,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.180]   please email it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.140]   Monday, we return to address a question
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.340]   from a single man who is sick of his singleness
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.860]   and wants to be satisfied in Christ
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.860]   while he waits for his bride.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.260]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.420]   (upbeat music)
