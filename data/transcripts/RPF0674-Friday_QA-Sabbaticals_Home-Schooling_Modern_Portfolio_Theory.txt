[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.320]   It's Friday and today live Q&A.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:34.640]   [Music]
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.080]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.960]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today we do
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.120]   a live Q&A. Works just like call-in talk radio. I publish a phone number and a time for my listeners
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   to call in. I publish that to patrons of the show, those who support me on patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.560]   They call in and we chat.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.720]   [Music]
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   If you would like to get access to a show like this, just go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.880]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance. Sign up to support the show there. Tell you what,
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.320]   I don't understand why more people don't take action to join and have these chats with me.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   As you know from being a listener, sometimes I give five, ten minutes, but sometimes I give an
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   entire hour to shows. Now, of course, I do some private consulting and a lot of people don't want
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.520]   their personal details out on the internet, which I get. Of course, I affirm that, which is why you
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.440]   always hear me just say first names in the state that somebody's calling from. But trust me, calling
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.120]   in and supporting the show on Patreon is a whole lot cheaper than is signing up for a consulting
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.880]   call with me. I just encourage you as those who love a good value, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   support the show there on Patreon, and you never know, it may give you a really good access to be
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.800]   able to chat with me on a Q&A show like this. We begin today in Oregon, Hill in Oregon. Welcome
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.240]   to the show. How can I serve you today, please?
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.240]   Hi, thanks. I'm just calling to get some advice on a Roth conversion. I actually was able to take
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   a recent year-long sabbatical, and so I'm still on that sabbatical and won't generate any income
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.200]   other than capital gains from general investment. And so I thought this might be the appropriate
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.800]   time to convert some of that stuff in the traditional IRA over to the Roth. Obviously,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.440]   that's going to generate an income, and I've looked at the tax brackets, but of course,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   this is a temporary state for me with a pretty high income tax bracket. So any thoughts on other
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.800]   factors I should consider when doing the conversion and doing so now while I don't have any other
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.680]   income? So you're temporarily in another state, not your home state, is that right?
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.200]   Right. I mean, I'm here just on the sabbatical. I'm sure once I do find a new job, I probably
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.800]   won't be in this state. It'll be someplace I'll come considered a resident of this state,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   but no plans to stay here long term. Okay. Have you checked your state laws to see if you are
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.240]   indeed at this point considered a resident of that state? Yes, I am. Okay. Well, that's the
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.120]   first opportunity is, of course, no matter where you go, you're going to have to deal with the
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.800]   federal taxes, but if you can be thoughtful about how you establish or don't establish residency
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.840]   in a new state, then I think that can, for other people, that may be able to save some money.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.080]   Each state has different rules that they apply for your being considered a resident of that state,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.720]   but in general, it all comes down to first knowing what those rules are and adjusting your life and
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   your decisions so that you can fit within those rules properly and honestly, and then just simply
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.760]   making sure that you don't make a big splash to bring focus and attention to what you're doing
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.320]   and where you are. But if you've already investigated that and you are a resident of
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.840]   that state, there's no way to get around it. Have you contacted your brokerage company and asked
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.120]   them for their advice and the process for doing what you're trying to do? No, that was actually
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.840]   my next step. Yeah, so that's going to be your best option is your brokerage company, whoever
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.440]   holds your retirement accounts, your IRAs, is going to be fairly familiar with the process at
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.000]   this point. I think they will have a checklist. They'll have the advice for what you need to do,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.880]   and this is largely just simply a matter of paperwork. So they'll tell you how they want
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.240]   you to handle the accounts. They'll tell you how they want you to actually do the process,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.360]   and so you need to rely on them for the actual process. You're definitely right. It is a good
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.520]   time for you to do it when you have no income. When you're on sabbatical, that's a good time
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   for you to make the conversion. And it's basically as simple as simply calling up your broker and
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.640]   saying, "I want to convert this amount of money into a Roth IRA. How can I do that?" and then
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.320]   following their process. I don't have any unique insight or unique recommendations to you other
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.440]   than what you've already identified. So you're ahead of the game. You've done your homework and
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.680]   you know what you're doing. Do you have any specific questions? No, that's it. I just wanted
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.640]   to get your insight on that type of activity. Thank you. Yeah, my pleasure. What's your strategy for
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.720]   sabbatical? What are you doing? Actually, I'm somewhat of a long-time listener of your podcast
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.600]   and your newsletters and everything that's come along. So I had the opportunity to kind of step
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.800]   away from a career. I won't say I'm 100% fire, but if I wanted to cut back some expenses, I probably
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.040]   could be. So the first step was to really take a year off to really kind of reassess and do what
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.400]   I want to do. So still kind of figuring out what the next chapter is going to be, but feel very
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.560]   fortunate that all the hard work over the last 20 years has paid off and that I'm in a position to
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:19.200]   do this. How new into the sabbatical are you? How many months has it been now? It's been about 15
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.400]   months. And what have you experienced over those 15 months? Like what's been your emotional state?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   What have you learned over these 15 months so far? It's been great. I would say personally,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.280]   it's just been a time to really, I think, live life the way it's really supposed to be. Instead
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.000]   of waiting until I'm 65 or 70 to really enjoy the fruits of my labor, I get to do it now,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.280]   which is great. So I landed myself in a beautiful place where I can do all the type of outdoor
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.960]   activities that I like to do and really not having to answer to anybody but myself. So it's a really
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   freeing and liberating experience and I recommend to everybody to do it if you can. If all your
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.000]   financial responsibilities are met, similar to some of the advice you've given over the years,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.080]   it's, you know, you only live once and if you can do it, absolutely. I know a lot of people within
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:22.160]   my career industry, I'm long-term in tech, weren't so excited about the idea. Thought I was kind of
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   crazy to step away, but I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Even if I have to
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.160]   end up taking a job that's much lower or different than what I've done before, I'm completely okay
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.240]   with that. And I think five years ago, I would have said, "No way." So, yeah.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.160]   Have you had along the past 15 months, has there been anything that you've looked at
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.880]   that you've thought, "You know, I would really enjoy doing that thing," or "I'm really inspired
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   about this other thing." Has there been any career opportunities or job opportunities that
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.600]   you've thought, "I would really like to explore that," or has it been primarily just simply
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.880]   enjoying not having to report to work every day? Right. I would say both. Both. So, I have looked
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.200]   at some, you know, the heartfelt passions, right? We all have personal passions, things that
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.960]   we would get out of bed regardless of what the paycheck was. And I definitely have explored that.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.200]   Most of it will reside in a non-profit space and/or a geographic location that I'm not super
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.440]   excited about. But, you know, I do find challenges as I start to dip my toes in the water for the
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.960]   next step of a career opportunity. I actually find a little bit of bias in the fact that I don't have
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.680]   non-profit experience, that people are kind of turning the other way. So, it's very interesting.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.160]   It's kind of a catch-22 I didn't quite expect. I think, "Hey, I'm coming with all this corporate
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.680]   experience. A budget is a budget." You know, you make things work the best you can within your
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.000]   constraints. So, I'm a little surprised that people wouldn't just grab the opportunity. Because
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.480]   I'm saying, "Hey, I don't care what the title is. I don't care how many direct reports I have. I
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.200]   really don't care. I just want to come and make a difference and love what I do."
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.320]   And I'm finding a lot of people just don't, they don't believe it. They don't buy it.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.480]   Are they freezing you out of volunteering or are they simply not being receptive to
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.960]   offering you a paid position? It's the paid position. Because I've
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.080]   already done a lot of volunteer work over the last year, year and a half, actually all my life.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.960]   And I've done some informational interviews with people pretty high up in non-profits.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.480]   And very interesting within Silicon Valley, they've got a lot of retirees or a lot of people
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.240]   within the FIRE community that will just go and volunteer in what used to be formally paid
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.040]   positions. And so, they're like, "Well, we actually don't have to hire people anymore because we have
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.080]   all these other people with all the free time and they're willing to do it for free."
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.360]   Right. Interesting.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.840]   So, interesting, interesting as well. I just didn't expect that. So,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.000]   definitely some lessons learned, but at this point, no regrets.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.040]   Good.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.560]   I planned this. I did it well. And again, anybody who has the opportunity to do it,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   do it as soon as you can because you only live once. Life is so short.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.840]   So, enjoy it.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.640]   Yeah. Thank you for sharing your experience. I want to just share a few minutes of monologue
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.640]   for my listeners, new listeners especially. I think that the strategy that Hill is talking about
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.400]   with regard to taking a sabbatical is something that we should all have in the back of our head.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.440]   It doesn't have to be something that you say, "I'm absolutely going to do it now." But it's
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.640]   one of the best strategies to accomplish some kind of life change, life transition,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.440]   and to try different ideas, different lifestyles without making a major commitment.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.960]   One of the big errors that I see people make is they work at a job, live in a place, and do that
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.400]   job for many decades, at least traditionally, looking forward to a day of retirement when
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.960]   they're just ready to quit and enjoy the fruit of their retirement. And there are many people
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.280]   who have done that. But if you look at the experiences that many of those people report,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.640]   it's all across the board. And in general, the people who retire successfully are the ones who
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.280]   don't just simply quit work, quit a job they don't like, but rather they are ones who are
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.000]   retiring to something. So the traditional model of years and decades in a certain industry or
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.520]   a certain company can work very well. But it also puts a lot of pressure on a person to get it
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   exactly right. Now, some people, they're thrilled with their decision. But I think a lot of people
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.640]   would be better served with pursuing some kind of sabbatical strategy, some kind of testing strategy.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.200]   And one of the big mistakes that you can make with any aspect of business development or
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.920]   financial planning is to commit yourself too deeply unnecessarily. You wouldn't,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.800]   you'd be unwise, for example, if you've never lived in Dallas, Texas, you would be unwise if
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.440]   you're living in Washington, DC, to buy a house in Dallas, Texas, to move to your house when you
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.120]   haven't actually been there. That's why we generally advise if you're going to move to a new place,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.880]   just go rent a place till you figure out what neighborhoods you like and what part of the city
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.680]   is has the better traffic and where are the kind of people that you like to be with, where do they
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.720]   hang out. So you go and you test, you rent a house for a year, then if you want to buy a house,
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.440]   you buy a house. Well, a similar thing can happen with jobs and career changes. If you're interested,
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.600]   for example, I've always said if I were going to start a restaurant, I wouldn't go and spend
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   the hens or hundreds of thousands of dollars leasing a building, buying all the equipment,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.800]   etc. I would go and get some jobs in a restaurant because it's a lot cheaper for you and easier and
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.520]   more effective for you to go and learn on somebody else's dime for six months or a year and get the
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.240]   inside view. You will never get the actual inside view on something as well from simple research as
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.520]   you do from going and being involved. So a similar thing can come in with something like trying out
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.880]   a retirement lifestyle or trying out a move. And so a sabbatical is a word, it's of course an
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.520]   honored word that comes primarily from academia, but it's a word that people understand and it's
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.360]   a neat way for you to position yourself tentatively into some kind of life change without making a
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.800]   full and deep commitment. And a sabbatical strategy can have a number of interesting
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.400]   benefits for you, especially interesting financial benefits. You heard Hill talk about making a Roth
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.480]   IRA conversion. If you have enough money saved that you can live on, then you can safely and
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.040]   effectively go to a place, you can even go to a place that has high income taxes. And if you're
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.920]   just living on savings, you won't wind up paying high income taxes in that scenario. Or you can do
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.240]   a strategy of converting some of your IRA dollars to Roth IRA dollars because you don't have a high
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.800]   earned income. And so you're at the very lowest tax bracket to make that conversion depending on
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.640]   the specific details. And now that can be a very financially effective thing for you to do. Or you
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.160]   can do it as a strategy. Let's say that you're going to go and get some additional schooling.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.440]   Well, if you go to school while you're working and apply for need-based financial aid, you have
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.080]   to report a high income. It's a lot easier if you can simply report a low income or non-existent
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.840]   income, then you can qualify for more financial aid. So whether it's moving to a place, trying a
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.800]   place out, financially, there are lots of little wrinkles that you can use to enjoy a certain
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.600]   lifestyle without making a long-term commitment. Another way that you could use a sabbatical is as
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.440]   an opportunity to adjust your lifestyle. For example, let's say you've always been intrigued
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.120]   with the idea of being a hardcore minimalist, living out of a backpack, but you're not quite
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.920]   ready to tell everyone, "You know what? I'm going to sell my house. I'm going to sell my car,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.760]   and I'm going to go and live out of a backpack." But you can solve that problem if you say,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.160]   "I'm going to go on sabbatical, and I'm going to go and live here for a time. I'm going to go and
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.320]   do this travel thing. I'm on sabbatical." People understand the word. And so now you can rent out
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.240]   your house. You can put your car in storage or lend it to somebody, and you can try the lifestyle
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.880]   out without being fully committed. And so by making the social pressure a little bit simpler,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.440]   you may be able to do something that otherwise you wouldn't have the courage to do. In addition,
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.480]   financially, there can be neat ways to do it. So if you watch markets and you try to get a
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.560]   sense of moving in time with the market, let's say that you bought a house five years ago,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   and the house has served your needs well for the last five years, but you think you'd like
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.200]   to do something different. Well, think of it like a sabbatical. Sell the house, take the tax-free
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.920]   gain, if you have some, sell the house. But instead of immediately jumping into the marketplace,
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.680]   go and take a sabbatical. Go to the other side of the world or go to another state and rent a little
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.240]   apartment somewhere, and then come back to your home community in a year or two, maybe the real
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.720]   estate market has had a correction, and buy something else or change your situation. Similar
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.560]   things with jobs. It's very... and especially if you'll just simply build a good story so that you
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.240]   can explain a gap in your work experience. I took a sabbatical, and I went to Italy, and I studied
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.400]   wine in Italy. Or I took a sabbatical, and I went and I volunteered with this not-for-profit
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.320]   organization that's saving the trees. And the great thing about that is when you can explain
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.720]   what you're doing, you don't have to have all the details. So let's say that you got laid off,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.240]   right? Or you think you're going to get laid off. Like, it being laid off can be its own unique
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.560]   financial strategy to try to take advantage of the severance pay. But if you'll go and just simply
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.440]   say, "I'm quitting this job," and you go and you volunteer a few hours a week for the saving the
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.320]   trees organization. Meanwhile, you're spending your time studying and positioning and building
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.160]   your brand so that you can transition into another career. You can honestly say, "I was volunteering
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.320]   with a Save the Trees organization and taking a sabbatical." And now you don't have that same
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.200]   problem with a hiring interview of defending, "Why were you unemployed for a year?" And then
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.240]   finally, from the perspective of early retirement, getting a sense of what the lifestyle can be like
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.920]   in the same way that Hill talked about. Getting the sense of what it's like to own your time
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:45.840]   can help you to get some insight into the best plan forward for you. I know for me, I can't imagine
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.640]   wanting to not be productive. But what I seem to find is that three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.280]   something in that range, like the five-year range, is a really nice amount of time for me to engage
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.120]   in an industry and engage in a topic. Then I feel like, "Okay, I've got the hang of this." And then
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   a break would be nice. And then I can move on to something else because I enjoy the process of
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.880]   learning. And so you can go and say, "Well, I'm not sure I want to quit, but I'm just going to
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.920]   take a year." And along the way, you might find a creative opportunity. You might find the right
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.520]   organization that you want to work for or the right kind of job that you would actually really
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.000]   enjoy that would give you a nice lifestyle. Or you decide, "No, I actually want to just cut my
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.040]   expenses a little bit and live on my savings." So a sabbatical strategy, I think, is an incredibly
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.560]   valuable strategy for you to always have in the back of your head. And whether you do it proactively
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.120]   because, "Hey, I'm going to do it this year," or whether you do it reactively, such as, "I just
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.440]   got laid off. I'm going to take a sabbatical now." That's up to you. But if you at least have it
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   there as an idea and you think about what you would do in a sabbatical, you're more likely,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.120]   I think, to make a good decision when the opportunity presents itself. So thank you,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.640]   Hill, for calling in. We go now to Illinois. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.520]   I serve you today? Yeah. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead, sir. Okay. Yeah. Great. Thanks.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.960]   Hey, I just wanted to... I have two questions that are very closely related, and I know you
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.720]   will have some insight because it's about schooling my children. We're done with public
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.120]   school. We're sick of it in Illinois. And we're trying to decide between a private Christian
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.840]   school. There's a couple of really good options. And then, of course, homeschooling. I think I
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.800]   prefer homeschooling, but the logistics of our life might make it... I'm not sure if it's totally
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:39.040]   doable. So one thing I wanted to ask you is just kind of maybe your thoughts on how to maybe make
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.280]   it doable. Then the secondary question would kind of be if we'd go that route, if you could provide
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.840]   some guidance to maybe help us cut through all the multiple choices of things that are out there
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.040]   as far as home education. Sure. Yeah. Absolutely. How old are your children?
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   That's a quick summary. Yeah. They're currently eight and nine or eight. Sorry. They're currently
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.240]   six and eight, getting ready to be seven and nine. They're in first and third at public school,
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.880]   and next year, of course, will be second and fourth. Okay. So the first thing is you should
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:21.200]   feel very relaxed about this subject because your children are only six and eight. They're just
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.920]   finally at the age at which they should start to be engaging with academics. When I was younger,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.040]   one of the things that I have changed my opinion on over the years through a little bit of
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.960]   experience, when I was younger, I had the same thing that I think all new parents have of saying
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.360]   I've got to be obsessed with education. I've got to be... Specifically academics. In the United
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.400]   States, we really have been an academically oriented society. I especially feel extra
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.200]   pressure being a proponent of home education, that my children have to be the best academics.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   I used to read people who would say you shouldn't start academics until seven years old.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.560]   Here I was teaching my baby to read and trying to do academics with my three-year-old.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.120]   I said, "Well, maybe they're right, but I'm not happy waiting." Well, at this point,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.800]   my eldest is six. What my wife and I have just seen so obviously over the last year or two is
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.400]   just simply everything is what everyone told me, but I didn't believe it's easier if you wait until
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:30.960]   the child is ready. There is no such thing as being behind at these young ages. Our second child,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.000]   who is four, one of the things that I watch is just simply that they don't have any
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.800]   proclivity towards academics. Where I would have been freaking out if that were my first child,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.080]   at this point, I'm just relaxed about it. I know that everything will change between four,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.040]   five, six, seven, and eight. When you're thinking about something like schooling, you should,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.720]   at this point, with a six and eight-year-old, they don't need anything. They don't need anything,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.240]   literally anything except mom and dad to read to them. That's pretty much enough. You don't have
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.800]   to fit into this curriculum that, "Okay, by first grade, I've got to learn these things." They could
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.720]   just simply be with you and hang out. If you read to them, they will learn everything they need to
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.560]   learn. The second thing that should release you from hopefully some pressure is that you don't
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.920]   have to make any long-term commitment whatsoever, especially if you're making a transition from
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.360]   government school to something else. You don't have to know what that right something else is
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.600]   right now, and you don't have to know what it's going to be two or three years from now.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:38.000]   Most experienced homeschooled families, every year, they look and say, "Have a chat. Well,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.760]   what's working? What's not working?" You can change everything out. You can change
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.360]   from homeschooling to private schooling to government schooling. You can go back and
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.520]   forth every which way you need to go. You can change on a year-by-year basis. You can change
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:55.040]   curriculum. You can change anything that you need to change. You should be relaxed about this. It's
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.400]   only in a hyperacademic world that causes parents to feel, "I got to get this figured out." You got
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   a six-year-old and an eight-year-old, there should be no pressure whatsoever. Let's start on a tone
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.640]   of relaxed and think about what's in the best interest of our children, not on the tone of,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.160]   "I've got to produce this academic superstar." What are the actual logistics that would make
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   homeschooling difficult for your family that you were alluding to?
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:30.160]   Yeah. My wife and I both work full-time primarily is the main thing. The thing about it is that
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.640]   we have pretty great jobs that we really enjoy and that allow us a fair amount of free time.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.320]   I'm a firefighter. I work every third day. Really, it's eight 24-hour shifts a month. I'm home a lot.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.720]   Then my wife works four days a week. We've never really needed other people to watch our kids too
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.880]   much, maybe one or one and a half days a week. If we're doing homeschool, we'd have to either
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.560]   hire somebody, a nanny or a family member or something to take over on the day and a half
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.640]   we're not here, or my wife would have to quit working, which she doesn't totally want to do.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:13.760]   It would mean the massive lifestyle change, moving, all that stuff that would be the opposite of what
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.160]   you just advised, which is, "Hey, take it slow one year at a time." I'd hate to totally uproot
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   our family and cut our income in half and her in her career if we're like, "Oh, man,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.600]   homeschooling is not for us." How much is your income and how much is her income?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   I make close to $80,000 and she's in the mid-60s and has really good benefits too. She works for
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:45.840]   the federal government. Okay. The first thing is, yes, there's no obvious path. If your wife were
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.280]   making $30,000 a year, then it would be obvious. It would be, of course, she should just simply
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.840]   quit. Now, at a higher income, there's a higher price to you and to your family and to your
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.600]   income goals based upon that. That's where you would have to have a deeper conviction that you
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:13.040]   know exactly the path to go forward in and see why that is a good option to be willing to walk away
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.560]   from a $65,000 income. I don't think that's necessarily necessary, but I'll just simply give
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.720]   you a couple of things what I have found to be helpful about it. Number one, for you as a husband,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.960]   if your wife is a stay-at-home mom, that decision can be one of the most luxurious lifestyle
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:42.000]   decisions that you can personally enjoy. I don't understand. A lot of times, husbands put tons of
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.920]   pressure on their wives and say, "You've got to make more money." I used to do financial counseling
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.320]   with people and they would be like, "You've got to make more money because we need more income for
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.480]   the household." I find I have, ever since my wife quit her job, I have never regretted that a day.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.800]   And I cannot imagine the amount of money that she would need to make why I would want anything
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.720]   different. Because life, when you have full control over your family lifestyle, and there
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:11.600]   are a few things. Number one, in your case, you'll obviously have the constraints of your job unless
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.320]   you go to something that provides you with more freedom. But when you only have one vacation time
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.800]   to schedule, when you only have one boss to report to, it leads to so much more relaxation in your
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.440]   family than when you're trying to juggle two. Juggling two jobs, juggling vacation, and lining
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.600]   it all up with that is a very stressful thing. And especially if you go to homeschooling. One
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.760]   of the things I love about homeschooling is that we don't have to report to anybody. Now, in our
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.800]   case, one of my highest priorities is freedom. And so we've been able to build a lifestyle of
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.960]   basically complete freedom where I have nobody that I'm accountable to on a daily basis, which
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.520]   is really nice. My wife has nobody that I'm accountable to, that she's accountable to on a
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.120]   daily basis. And my children have no fixed schedule or no fixed accountability on a daily basis. So
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:04.480]   that means that we have full control over what we do. Now, we're driven. And so we have a schedule,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.800]   and we've got an hour by hour schedule. We're not unscheduled people. The kids are on a schedule,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.840]   my wife is on a schedule, I work on a schedule, etc. But when the opportunity presents itself,
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.160]   we can pivot on a dime. And I can cancel work today, we can cancel school today,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.320]   we can come and go. And that is an incredible luxury. And it's also a luxury with being able
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.560]   to enjoy all the little things together. You know, my wife and I go together to so many events. And
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.480]   so instead of it being this constant juggling of, okay, you got to do this, and I got to do that,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.320]   because I got an hour off here and another hour there, etc. It's just, it's awesome. It's so nice
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:49.680]   to have that life freedom. That is really, really nice. The other thing is simply that when you are
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:57.440]   freed up to focus on the children, and when you're freed up, especially if your wife is freed up from
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.400]   the stress of the job, having that always in the back of her head, it can change her ability to
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.840]   mother effectively. Where instead of having to worry about keeping current, keeping at the cutting
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.440]   edge of her industry, and also being a mom, which is the situation that most working mothers are in,
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.000]   she can just simply focus on the things that are right for the children. And she never has to think
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.640]   and worry about what her schedule is like, etc. Now, those are the two things that I find really
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.920]   compelling. And then also the cost savings. If you're going to get a high quality education in
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.680]   a private school, maybe a private Christian school, private school, whatever, it's going to
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.080]   be minimum... Well, let me ask you, what have you guessed as far as the schools that you've thought
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:43.040]   about? What's their tuition? Yeah, we've looked into it, and it would be about $800 a month.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.840]   Right. So that's not an insubstantial cost. Now, she'd still be ahead in terms of income if you're
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.520]   paying for the private school, but it's not an insubstantial cost. So that's what I like about
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.080]   making the decision to prioritize home life. It's the best freeing decision possible, and I think
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.720]   it's incredibly important, especially for younger children. Now, eight and six, you're starting to
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.160]   make a transition now where it can be different. That said, I would be, especially if you haven't
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.840]   homeschooled, I wouldn't see any reason to make that kind of big jump. Your wife likes her job,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.480]   she wants to be involved in it. What I would just do is do the schedule you've done, and then recruit
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:27.840]   a family member or hire a caretaker for the children for that day per week, or try to negotiate
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.040]   it with some kind of co-op arrangement. As we talk in just a moment about the choices for school and
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.160]   how you work through them, what I think works the best for most people is to be involved in some
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:45.040]   kind of community organization as well. So we often draw this dichotomy between, well, you either go
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.400]   to a traditional classroom school every day, and you're there five days a week, or you do everything
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.560]   at home, homeschooled. Well, that's not the actual experience of most homeschoolers. Most
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.760]   homeschoolers are involved in some kind of community group, some kind of co-op, some kind
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.720]   of two-day-a-week school, something like that. And that seems to be a really ideal structure,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:12.240]   I think, for most people, because they get the benefits of home education while also having some
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.800]   of those benefits of classes with others, the social contact, et cetera, without it being so
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.960]   extreme as the full-time model. And so in a situation like yours, if you were to get involved
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   in some local community, in time it would probably be fairly easy for you to find another family,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:34.880]   and on that day your children go to the house of another family on the day that one of you is not
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.480]   available for them, and/or hire somebody to come to your home, or a family member, et cetera. And
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.000]   since you're not sure if you're going to like it long-term, I definitely think that you shouldn't
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.120]   burn any bridges career-wise, but you should start by testing it and seeing what you prefer.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.000]   Right. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And we live in a thriving homeschool community
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.520]   where there's multiple co-op groups, and they're all mostly conservative, Protestant families and
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.080]   stuff, so I think we'd have a lot of resources there, too. So yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   And I think that also, especially if you are willing to pay, if you have that strong community
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.840]   of people you know, you like, you respect, you trust, et cetera, first, of course, you can just
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.520]   simply swap help. I think it's such a relief, especially on a mom, a full-time mom, to have a
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.680]   day where she can take her children to so-and-so's house and they stay there. That's such a relief
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.200]   for her. And so you could find somebody that you guys just simply swap some kind of child care,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.000]   and/or if you pay and you're willing to pay for somebody to do that, it should be easy for you
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.400]   in a large, thriving homeschool community to find somebody who's effective, who's competent,
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.200]   and to say, "Hey, listen, we want to homeschool the children, but one or two days every week or
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.040]   two, or however the schedule works out, we can't do it ourselves. And so what we need is, would
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.400]   you be willing for X number of dollars to care for our children on that day?" And there should
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.040]   be a family that would be happy for that, because there are lots of families who would be really
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.680]   grateful for a chance to relatively easily earn a little bit of extra money. And your children
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.000]   would get other benefits, other educational benefits, the input of somebody else, etc.,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   into their life. I think that's actually really helpful also in terms of having other authority
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.840]   figures. One of the challenges that my wife and I have had with our children is teaching our
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:32.960]   children to respond effectively to authority that's not simply her and me. And so I've actually
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.920]   actively sought out other people because of recognizing that my children are not responding
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.240]   well to other people. I've sought out other teachers and tried to bring them in so that
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.400]   they understand that you're not the king of the world. You do need to respond to other authorities,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.480]   not just dad and mom. And so if you have a family or a couple families that you trust,
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.960]   I think you would very easily be able to find a solution there.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.640]   Yeah, that's good. Well, we've budgeted at least $800 a month for private schools.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:00.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.200]   So we have that available for that too.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.520]   Exactly. Especially also then, let's talk about other logistics of that.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:13.600]   With the logistics of homeschool, and we'll go to philosophies in a minute, but one of the things
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:21.040]   that I think is important to focus on and to emphasize is, I'll just speak for me, one of my
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   goals as a homeschool dad is not to be my child's teacher, but to teach my child how to teach
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.680]   themselves. Now that's really hard at four, right? Because they can't sit still and they need
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:39.840]   somebody to teach them ABCs. But at eight, your eight-year-old is at a point where your eight-year-old
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:46.480]   should be able to, at this point, pretty much be able to work their own work. And so depending on
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.120]   the curriculum that you would choose, let's say that you chose something simple, like a curriculum
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.480]   that has workbooks, you give your child and you say, "Here is the work that you're required to do."
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   And the eight-year-old says, "I need to complete my math workbook. I need to complete my reading
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.120]   workbook. I need to complete this other, whatever you're doing, a writing assignment or a writing
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.000]   workbook as well." And you know the expectation is that each day you need to do eight pages.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.240]   And so what you're doing is basically, you transition the child to say, "You're responsible
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:21.120]   just to bring me the eight pages. We're not going to sit and hold your hand. You sit down and you do
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.760]   work and you do the pages. And when you're done, you're done." And that I think is one of the most
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   valuable lessons for a child to learn. So even if you are recruiting somebody to be a caretaker for
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.440]   your child, that person doesn't necessarily have to teach your child, especially your older one.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.200]   Your six-year-old may be different, but that person doesn't necessarily have to be a qualified
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.520]   teacher. They just simply need to be a caretaker. And it's your child's responsibility to do their
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:50.960]   work. Once your child can effectively read, there should be diminishing need for a teacher.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:58.560]   Once your child can read and write, their basic need of a teacher is to help guide the materials,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.320]   to make sure that they're having materials that are going to stimulate them, that are going to
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.560]   help achieve their educational goals, sorting through curriculum, seeing what's working,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.240]   where they're hitting their head against the wall and making any changes there, and then correcting
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.360]   some of their work, correcting their written work, correcting their essays. But as far as the actual
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.520]   teaching, my goal is that they learn how to teach themselves. So you don't need a great teacher. You
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.640]   just need a safe environment where the child is going to be cared for, protected, have contact
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   with other people, someone to serve them lunch, and then they can teach themselves on that day.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.240]   Make sense?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:38.640]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.480]   Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't hear that. Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   Okay. So as far as philosophy, I think there are good arguments to be made in favor of a private
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   school, a private Christian school, versus a home school. I don't think that homeschooling is always
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.960]   necessarily a slam dunk. There are opportunities, so there are opportunities that a child can
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.280]   receive in their education that can be provided by a school that they can't get in homeschool.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:13.360]   You probably are not going to have the same extensive lab equipment for a chemistry lab
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.920]   in your home as you might at a larger school. Your child is probably going to have a harder
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.440]   time learning Latin when they're studying it themselves at home versus part of a school.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.440]   And so I'm not opposed to private schools. I think they have benefits. My biggest opposition
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:37.200]   to private schools is that most of them take the same system as the government school and then just
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.080]   simply say, "Well, we do it in a slightly safer environment. We have fewer stabbings in class."
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   Or if it's a Christian school, "We just toss in a little bit of creationism alongside evolution,"
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.000]   or "We baptize this and we talk about God doing this thing here." But it's very challenging to
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.720]   find an actual private Christian school that's thoroughly and authentically Christian. And so
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:08.080]   I don't—I get very suspicious. I think they exist. But a lot of times you struggle to see
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.200]   the—I struggle to see the benefit of most private schools. For example, one of the biggest problems
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.600]   of government schooling is the one-size-fits-all curriculum where children are not treated based
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.560]   upon their personal interests. They're not treated based upon their personal abilities,
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.400]   nor is their educational path timed according to their own personal capabilities. They're part of
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.160]   a class of 20 people. This is the curriculum that we study. Everybody has to do it. And if they're
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.920]   bright, they're bored, or if they're slow, they're overwhelmed. And so that doesn't—especially in
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.240]   the early years—I think that that's not a great thing to do. School should be tailored to the
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.200]   individual needs of the child to the greatest degree possible. Now, can you find teachers
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.600]   who are going to care for the child and seek to stimulate the bright child, etc.? Of course you
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.760]   can. But I think the personalized model of education is going to be one of the best.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:11.440]   I've already spoken about self-direction. One of the—as far as I see it—one of my basic goals for
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:17.360]   my children's education is that they learn how to learn and that they never have the idea that
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.760]   learning is something that happens to you. That they never have the idea that my only role is to
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.560]   go to class, sit in a chair, and listen to a teacher, and then whatever they say, I have to
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.320]   have that teacher. Children do need good teachers. And even if you homeschool in time, you'll hire
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.840]   great teachers. You'll hire world-class tutors. You'll hire the people that they need.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.240]   But the basic model of schooling—the most important thing—is that a child learns
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.840]   that anything in the world that someone else has learned, I can learn too,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.760]   and that they develop the skill and confidence of being able to teach themselves.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:57.920]   So that doesn't work well in the context of a private school. In addition, the private school
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.720]   doesn't facilitate the same kind of relationship with mom and dad, especially in the early years,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.520]   the most important lessons for a child to learn are not academic. They're character and moral
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.880]   lessons. So you can adjust and control the moral environment to a high degree by choosing a private
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:18.400]   school. So now at least you know that this school is going to maintain these standards. This is
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.080]   their statement of faith. This is what they believe in. This is what they think is right and
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.120]   wrong. And so now you can have greater confidence that you can in a government school where you,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.160]   your only choice is simply what zip code to live in, and somebody else, without any reference to
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.560]   you, your desire, your individual beliefs as a family, your moral stance, etc., hires a bunch
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.480]   of people to indoctrinate your children. You can have a little bit more control, but you still
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   don't have nearly the same control and the same opportunity to influence morally and character-wise
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.200]   your children as you do with homeschooling. And I think that in general, I think that another
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:00.560]   major problem of many private schools is they're too academically oriented. In my opinion,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   we have too much of a focus on academics in the modern American school system and too little of
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.520]   a focus on practical skills. People say all the time, "Why didn't they teach us about money in
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:19.920]   high school?" Well, we could talk about it, but I don't know why, except that they don't. And so
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.080]   used to be that when you went to school, you would have a shop class or a home economics class,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.280]   and I had a great economics teacher who taught about personal finance. But the average student
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:36.800]   doesn't go through any kind of mainstream school and come out with any kind of practical skills.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.560]   The average student doesn't come out with the ability to earn money. They don't come out with
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.680]   any kind of real qualification for a job or a business. They simply have a diploma. And the
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.960]   diploma is so academically oriented that if they're academically inclined, they had a great time. But
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.680]   if they're not academically inclined, they didn't do much. And so one of the biggest reasons that I
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.840]   have, why I think that my guess would be that we will homeschool all the way through, although I
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.400]   reserve the right to change my opinion on that as we see how our children are developing. But one of
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.160]   the biggest things that I observe is I don't want my children to just have this single-sided focus
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:17.760]   on academics. So schooling is such a waste of time because of all of the stuff associated with it
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:24.080]   that the child has many more opportunities in homeschooling to develop a diverse array of skills.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:29.440]   If you take the average school day, you know, the child rides a bus, 30 minutes on the bus,
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.480]   15 minutes waiting for the bus, they go, you put together all the subjects. There is such an
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.000]   absolute catastrophic waste of time when the child is waiting on other students,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   waiting in all the stuff, being held back, having a study hall here, etc.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:49.760]   Home education is so much more efficient. The average homeschool student probably spends three
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:56.080]   hours a day on schooling. And you can do what's done in a government school or even a good private
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:01.280]   school in three to four hours a day. And so what I look at it is I say, I want my children to have
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.920]   time to play. I believe that play is really important. I want my children to have time to
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.640]   create. And how are they going to have that if they're spending eight hours a day in class doing
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:17.120]   work they could finish in three or four? So the better plan, I think, is school at home, get up,
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.320]   they start school at eight o'clock, by noon they're done with all of the academics. And then
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.440]   let's take the additional time and focus that on something that's going to be more profitable for
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.600]   them. So whether that's they're building a tree house in the afternoon, learning how to work with
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.200]   tools and do construction, whether they're learning how to do accounting and they're
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.720]   building up a little sideline accounting business, whether they're learning how to,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.840]   they got a backyard forge and they're learning how to make blacksmithing stuff and knives,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:48.000]   whether they're learning how to write and they're writing short stories or novels or writing magazine
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.240]   articles, whether they're writing a blog, whether they're shooting YouTube videos, I don't know.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.120]   But there are so many opportunities that it's far better, especially for a nine-year-old,
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.680]   a 10-year-old, 11-year-old, 12-year-old, it's better to have from 12.30 to 5.30 available for
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.560]   the development of those practical skills than to spend 12.30 to 5.30 sitting in a class listening
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.920]   to a teacher drone on and on when they could have just read the book and taught themselves the
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:20.560]   subject matter. And so those are some of the reasons why I'm really optimistic about homeschooling
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.520]   because it just seems much more efficient. And I would just add one more thing.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:29.920]   One of the big benefits of homeschooling also is you get to control the annual calendar. Now,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.680]   many homeschool students take summers off and I'm not sure if we'll ever take summers off or not.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.480]   People argue that it's a good idea. People argue that you should. But I personally don't see at the
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:52.320]   moment why it's of any help to have only 183 days of academic schooling per year. Many teachers,
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.160]   the counter arguments, people say they should take time off so there's a break for the child.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:04.720]   They should take time off for the refreshment of the family, have a chance to do other things as
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.920]   well. And I'm fine with those things. But at the moment, I don't currently have any plans to ever
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:17.680]   take summers off with the children. And so if you take, and instead of having 180 days of school per
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.960]   year, you have 230 days of school per year because you don't have that summer break. So you don't
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.000]   have all the time wasted of pulling down to summer and then all the time of getting the kids going
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.360]   again. But you just do school year round mixed with vacations, breaks, etc., whatever's necessary.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.400]   You can put the child significantly ahead as well. That's another undersung benefit.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:45.280]   So when you take a much more concentrated, focused study time, when you take a personalized
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   curriculum for the child to have their parents and skilled teachers involved, helping them to
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.080]   develop a curriculum that's best for them, you take the ability to focus, learning how to teach
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:01.920]   themselves, learning how to work day by day, you take the ability to have more time. You know,
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.880]   if your family works five days a week, fine, have the child do five days a week. In your case,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.440]   when it's probably a little bit squirrely, have the child do six days a week. Six days a week is
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:16.800]   better than five days a week, especially with your schedules, so that there's more consistency.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.480]   And then do it year round with some time for family vacations, a week or two off at the holiday.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.600]   And now your opportunity to do academic learning is far beyond what it is in most schools. And then
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.920]   you add on to it the practical skills, the developing career skills and personal skills
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.760]   and business skills, etc. With the goal of turning out an 18-year-old who is earning a full-time
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:47.040]   income, you have many more options. Final point, I guess I'll make my final argument. I don't know,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.080]   because I haven't raised a high school student yet, what this will actually be like when we get
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.520]   there. I expect to change many things based upon experience. But in my current thinking and my
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.800]   current seeing and working with some high school students, I don't see any reason why an academically
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.000]   inclined 18-year-old in today's world shouldn't simply graduate simultaneously with their high
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.920]   school diploma and a college degree. And when you look at the power of that, with them being able to
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.320]   do distance learning, to clip out of dozens of classes, to mix it up with an online degree that
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.840]   gives them a fully accredited bachelor's degree, I think that if you have a child who is good at
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:31.440]   academics, that's also something that's well worth considering, whether it's by 18 or 19 or 20. I
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.920]   don't see any reason why a bright 18, 19 or 20-year-old shouldn't have their college degree
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.800]   by the time they're 18, 19 or 20. Then if they want to go on and get a master's degree, PhD, great,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.480]   they're ahead. If they don't want to go on, they're ahead. And when you bring in, in your case,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.040]   you're both working jobs, but when you bring in the context of a family business, when you bring
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.640]   in the context of helping them to earn income, the arguments are so powerful on the side of
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.680]   homeschooling that I think it's a real cost to put a child, not just a financial cost, it's a real
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.680]   cost of worse results and outcomes to put a child into a schooling environment that isn't tailored
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.760]   to them versus the opportunities of individualized education. So that's my monologue for you.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.360]   No, that's good. And obviously I've heard some of your arguments before and
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:25.360]   yeah, I think, so we're actually already having our kids work in, I've got a little bit of a
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.200]   real estate business too, and they're already working in that.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.160]   Great. Awesome.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.760]   But yeah, so anyway, that just would allow us even more opportunities for that sort of thing,
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.320]   I think. So that's good too. So, all right. I appreciate it.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.360]   My pleasure. Thank you for calling in and may you know God's wisdom as you seek to look at
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.280]   your family, consider the needs and the interests of everyone involved and the individual needs of
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.680]   your children. May you know God's wisdom in all of that. We go now to New York, Peter in New York.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Hi, Josh. How are you?
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.440]   My pleasure. Doing well, sir. Welcome.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.000]   I have a question about modern portfolio theory.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.920]   Okay. Is it safe to say if you try to get
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:21.760]   investment advice from most CFPs or people working at a wire house or registered investment advisors,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:28.000]   is it safe to say almost all of them are going to give you advice based on your risk tolerance
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   in accordance with modern portfolio theory? Yes, it is absolutely safe to say that.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.120]   And they cannot, they will not be allowed by their firm to give you advice based upon any other
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:48.720]   financial theory. Got it. So is it, I don't know if it's worth talking about how that even modern
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.680]   portfolio theory even came around, but I mean, is it basically safe to say it provides the standard
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.400]   of care and legal defense for the investment industry when they provide the investment advice?
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:07.360]   Yes. And remember that it's all about, basically it's all about not being wrong. Now let's ignore
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:14.000]   motivation. Let's assume the best of intentions of everybody and ignore some, ignore motivation.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   But when you're dealing with any kind of mainstream large investment firm,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.040]   can be a big investment company, big brokerage, big insurance company, any kind of mainstream
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:31.680]   brand recognized name, the biggest thing is don't mess it up. Don't mess it up. Because
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:38.800]   when a financial advisor is managing assets, there's very little incentive for the financial
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:45.200]   advisor to grow assets beyond what the market returns. The number one goal of a financial
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:51.040]   advisor is to accumulate assets under management so that they can earn fees on those assets under
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:57.200]   management. But there's very little difference of the actual net income of the advisor based
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   upon whether the assets grow by 4% or decline by 4%. It's just important to keep the client happy.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.680]   And the number one way to keep the client happy is to make sure that their returns line up with
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:14.160]   everybody else's returns. So what you have in the financial space is you have everybody basically
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.880]   pursuing the same strategy. The only exceptions to that would be an independent advisor who is
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.480]   marketing themselves as having some different philosophy. There are plenty of them out there.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.480]   But they're not going to be employed at a big mainstream company, a big wire house or a big
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.120]   company you would know. They're going to have their own independent RIA and/or somebody who's
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:42.560]   running a hedge fund. And they're doing their own strategy in some way. But all of the mainstream
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.640]   stuff is all going to be based upon how do we make sure that we keep the client and basically
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:56.240]   getting the market return so that we can keep the client. Now, legally speaking, the standard
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:02.560]   of legal duty that the financial advisor owes their client is what's referred to as the prudent
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.840]   man rule. Now, we can argue about fiduciary standard versus non-fiduciary standard. That's
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.320]   largely immaterial here. I don't think most advisors, a lot of people disagree with me.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.800]   I'm not convinced that most advisors care much about fiduciary standard versus
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:22.160]   non-fiduciary standard. I think they just worry about not doing something that's totally wrong.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.360]   And today, the prudent man defense is simply going to be I followed the best recognized
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:34.320]   portfolio theory and modern portfolio theory is that standard. If you have somebody that deviates
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.560]   from that and they say, "No, I don't think modern portfolio theory is right. I don't think that this
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:43.520]   diversified portfolio of all the asset classes is right. And I'm going to put all my clients into
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.960]   this thing over here." And then you lose money. Then the client has now a legal case against the
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:56.160]   advisor and against the firm. And so they want to minimize that legal risk. And so, especially when
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.000]   you get into a large firm, the individual advisor has almost no wiggle room for recommending a
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.800]   portfolio. Now, maybe they can sell a client a stock and say, the client says, "I want to buy
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.880]   numbers of these shares." Maybe that's still done. But generally, they're just saying, "This is what
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:19.040]   our company is doing. And let me tell you how it works in terms of insight. When I was a financial
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:25.840]   advisor, I was a fully licensed fiduciary financial advisor representing portfolios for my clients.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.960]   And so the process works like this. The first thing you do is you bring the client in and you
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:36.480]   conduct a needs analysis of the client's needs and goals. Then you prepare a financial plan
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.760]   that illustrates to the client what their needs and goals are. Now, a good advisor is going to
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:50.320]   look at that financial plan and say, "Is there a way that we can get what the client needs? Is the
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:55.520]   portfolio going to get this?" But you cannot play with investment return rates. Your software
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.400]   basically doesn't even allow it. You can say the person is an aggressive investor, and it'll allow
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:06.720]   you to put in 6.8% rate of return instead of 6.3. But you can't say, "I'm going to earn 12% here."
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:15.680]   The software is constrained by your firm to do what the firm's actuaries think the portfolio will
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.960]   do. So you present a financial plan, and then you give an idea of whether or not the results are
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.040]   feasible. Then the client says, "Okay, I'll move my money over to you." You make your sales pitch
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   as to why you think that client should work with you. Well, the first step is you create, you do a
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.120]   risk profile questionnaire. The risk profile questionnaires are all the same across every
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.560]   industry. It's the same that you do online with your online brokerage as you do in person. Some
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:49.760]   have 10 questions, some have 12. At the end of the day, it's going to spit out for you based upon
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:56.240]   how the client answers the up and down volatility questions, and largely based upon the time horizon.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.640]   How many years are you before you need this portfolio? And how many years are you going to
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.720]   be taking distributions from the portfolio? It's going to spit out about the same answer,
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.960]   and just about everybody is going to be a balanced or a moderately aggressive or a moderately
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.240]   conservative. The questionnaires generally don't allow somebody to be aggressive, and they generally
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:20.160]   don't allow somebody to be very conservative, unless the person is intentionally answering the
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:25.920]   questions to force that. So I could force a questionnaire to give me an aggressive portfolio,
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.760]   but if you're just answering honestly, they're always going to come out in the middle.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.480]   So you create the portfolio, you match it up, the firm gives you a set of portfolios, and they say
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:43.120]   here's a portfolio that works for an investor who is interested in this particular risk profile.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:48.080]   And you choose your portfolio based upon the platform that you want to use. So if you want
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.280]   to use a certain mutual fund company, and you want to use class A shares of a mutual fund,
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:59.200]   you have your model portfolio for that mutual fund company and for that share class. If you're going
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.720]   to do a managed portfolio, then you have your various managed portfolios based upon which one,
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:10.960]   what benefit you're trying to get. If you're going to use a variable annuity, you have your model
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.200]   portfolios and your variable annuity. Every single different product just simply has the model
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.720]   portfolios. And so you as an advisor, you're not a daily portfolio manager, you're a financial
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:27.120]   advisor, you're not a portfolio manager. So you choose the portfolio that's going to match up with
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:33.440]   the investor's risk tolerance. Then you submit the paperwork through to your firm, and your
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.240]   compliance officer looks at it very carefully. They look at the application, they look at the
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:43.600]   risk profile questionnaire, and they make sure that the portfolio that you are assigning to the client
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:50.240]   is going to be lined up with that risk profile questionnaire. Because if the client has
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:56.160]   completed a risk profile questionnaire, and if the portfolio that's offered has been reviewed by the
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.920]   portfolio managers, and it comes to it's a good portfolio, it follows all of the rules of
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:07.680]   modern portfolio theory, it's been looked at, understood, considered, etc. They'll let it go.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   And there's no legal liability. There's no legal liability in that case for the advisor or for the
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:19.920]   firm, because they're recommending what's the current professional standard. If your portfolio
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.200]   doesn't match the risk profile questionnaire, at least by within one, you get a call from your
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.720]   compliance officer. So you can't have a person that has a risk profile questionnaire of moderately
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.200]   conservative, and then put them in aggressive portfolio. You have to go back and fit in. No,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:41.520]   it's just not even going to be allowed. And so that's the process. And if it goes through, then
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.920]   you put the portfolio in place. And then hopefully, if you're a good financial advisor, you're working
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.560]   really hard to serve the client, to help them to earn your money by helping to control their
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.120]   behavior, keeping them invested, making sure that things are doing well. But at the end of the day,
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:02.240]   you're going to get basically the same portfolio from any mainstream financial advisor with any
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:13.680]   mainstream company, because that is the current standard. >> Got it. Yeah, I've been getting some
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:20.720]   sort of second opinions on what I'm invested in. And I'm realizing very quickly that everyone I get
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:26.000]   a second opinion from, it's all going to be the same thing. And that's not the advice I was looking
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:33.360]   for. >> Right. Yeah, you're not going to get a second opinion on your portfolio that's any
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.800]   different from any large company of one company versus another. Now, that's not to say that
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:44.400]   they're wrong, right? There's good arguments in favor of this approach to investing. There are
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:49.280]   good arguments. And I'm not sure they're wrong. I'm not sure they're right. But you're not going
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.640]   to get any major difference from one company to the next. Because the key thing is for you to know
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.480]   that those financial advisors are not investment experts. They may have experience, but they've
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.400]   read the same books that you can read. They've just simply taken a test. And when you take the
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.320]   licensing exam, you're taught modern portfolio theory. You have to understand that because
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:13.280]   that's the current standard. The only way you're going to get a different answer is if you're
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:19.520]   talking to somebody who has their own investment philosophy, and they're passionate about their
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.960]   investment philosophy. And that person is not going to be at a big company. They're going to
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.200]   be at a registered investment advisor running their own, or they're going to be part of a small
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.640]   investment firm somewhere. But they have their own opinion, their own ideas. And they're willing to
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.440]   say, "This is how I run a portfolio, and this is why it's different." And they'll lay out their
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.200]   story for you as to what they think. You would have to assess their story and say, "Do I believe
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.080]   that this is the right story for me?" But they're not going to be at a big mainstream company.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:54.160]   The only thing that you can expect from differentiation from a big mainstream company
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:01.760]   is, first, is there a difference in the basic costs of the platform? For example,
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:07.600]   if the obvious thing is if you are working with an advisor who is recommending passive mutual
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.720]   funds instead of active mutual funds, there's going to be a major cost difference of the
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:16.960]   underlying expenses and fees. Or if you're working with a wealth management company that will allow
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.160]   you with your $5 million portfolio to own individual stocks, and they'll model the portfolio,
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.120]   they'll model an index on individual stocks, how much is that worth to you? And then the
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.520]   individual financial planning advice of the advisor is also going to change. The product
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.200]   suite that they like and that they're comfortable with, you talk with somebody at an insurance
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.440]   company, you're going to have more insurance products in your plan than somebody who doesn't
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:47.920]   do insurance. If you talk to somebody who is an expert tax planner, you may get more tax ideas
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:53.120]   than you would with somebody else. If I went back into mainstream financial advice, I would do what
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.760]   I do on the show here every day, but I still wouldn't be able to control somebody's portfolio.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:03.600]   That's just not me. So somebody would get much higher level of advice from me because of my
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.880]   interest in financial planning, but their portfolio is going to be the same because
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.320]   there's not an answer to that in the modern mainstream financial space that I'm aware of anyway.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:20.000]   Got it. Got it. Can I ask you one very quick follow-up question to that?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.560]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:28.480]   Is it safe to say that most of what they're trying to do with modern portfolio theory
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.440]   is keep people from selling out of their equity positions when the market tanks?
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:39.120]   And by that, I mean, if the money's in there for the long term and you've got equity positions,
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.680]   and you're not going to freak if 2008 happens again, and you don't want a bond allocation,
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:50.640]   is that really all they're trying to mitigate is the emotional aspects of the investor selling low?
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:57.200]   I'm not sure that it's so much the emotional aspects, but rather trying to say that...
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:03.600]   So the basic theory of modern portfolio theory is going to be based upon that investment curve
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:10.000]   to say that if we get together the right asset classes in the right proportion, we can have the
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.480]   lowest volatility as measured by the up and down, the standard deviation of the portfolio,
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:21.280]   and the highest cumulative return. And so by putting these classes together and scientifically
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.320]   analyzing them, we're getting the very best. For every bit of volatility that you as an investor
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.080]   are willing to sit with, we're going to give you the maximum return by adjusting our portfolio
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.760]   of stocks versus bonds, large cap, medium cap, small cap, international versus different bond
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.720]   portfolios, bring in some precious metals, bring in some real estate, etc. And so we're giving you
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.400]   the best possible return that you can get with the lowest volatility. And it's not so much managing
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.760]   emotions. It's a provable concept that if you have the right asset classes and the right
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.800]   mixture of those asset classes, you can get with modern portfolio theory a portfolio that has the
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:10.160]   highest historical probability of delivering the return that you want with the lowest volatility
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.080]   that you can handle. And I think that makes sense. That's where modern portfolio theory
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.000]   makes a lot of sense. That said, you're hitting the nail on the head to say that,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.400]   but I'm not sure that I necessarily want to have my conservative portfolio. And this is one of the
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:32.240]   things that I think that a good advisor can do a good job at. I have convinced many people
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.920]   to keep their investments invested very so-called aggressively, because I point out to them that
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.360]   you don't need these investments right now. You're working, you have a business, you're not going to
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.000]   spend the money. So if you can just discipline yourself to sit tight, go ahead, invest for a
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.160]   higher long-term return. And then with good financial planning, you put in place savings,
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:59.360]   you put in place an income portfolio, you should be able to get more long-term growth.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:07.600]   And then when you get down to it, at the end of the day, it all comes down to what your plan
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.440]   offers you in terms of what story you think the world is going to tell in the future,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.320]   and then how that fits up with your personal income needs. So if you're investing and you're
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.280]   saying, "I'm going to retire today and I'm going to live on my portfolio," you can't handle nearly
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.760]   as much volatility as somebody who's working, who's planning to always create income, and who's
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.080]   investing for the benefit of their great-grandchildren. And so if you understand modern portfolio theory,
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.240]   then you can go back to the individual investor and you can try to coach the investor to a different
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:49.200]   choice. Got it. Anything else? That's it. That'll do it. Thanks so much. All right,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.880]   thank you for calling in. That is our last call for today's podcast. I would simply say that
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:03.200]   it behooves you to become an expert at your money and to use professionals for the things
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.000]   that professionals are good at, but not to expect professionals to be good at the things that they
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.600]   don't do. And so one of the things that I've always tried to do is, especially with my experience in
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.920]   the financial industry, is be very honest about where financial advisors bring a lot of value
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.360]   and where they don't. Don't take what I said—I believe that financial advisors bring a lot of
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:31.920]   value or can bring a lot of value. So don't take my comments about the portfolio selection to say
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.480]   that you should become an anti-financial advisor person, that I'm just going to be a do-it-yourselfer
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:43.680]   and advisors have nothing to add. But don't expect an advisor to add value in a place where it's
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.520]   clear from conversations or from their firm structure, etc., that they can't add value. Don't
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.040]   expect that. It's not going to happen. So take advisors for where they're good and then fill in
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.160]   the areas with your own personal knowledge and study for where your particular advisor is weak.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.840]   As I close today's show on the topic of education, I want to invite you to come and take a look at my
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.240]   recommended reading list. I've put together a book list. It's called Joshua's Financial Freedom
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:18.560]   Book List. There are 12 books on that list, but I think that if you read through my list of 12 books,
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:24.720]   you will have an incredibly strong understanding of the different aspects of finance and a really
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   good foundation to build on. It is impossible to put together a book list that would answer
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.280]   every question. There's so many good books that I left off the list. What I try to do is create a
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.080]   list that for an individual who doesn't know where to start, doesn't know what they've got,
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.600]   they could come and could start reading, go in the order that I recommended to you, and you could
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.240]   educate yourself about what you need to know in the financial space to put yourself on a plan
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.440]   towards financial freedom in 10 years or less. If you are interested in that book list, go to
