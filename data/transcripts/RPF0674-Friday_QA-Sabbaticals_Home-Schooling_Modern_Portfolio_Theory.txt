[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:29.780]   As far as philosophy, I think there are good arguments to be made in favor of a private school, a private Christian school, versus a home school. I don't think that homeschooling is always necessarily a slam dunk. There are opportunities, so there are opportunities that a child can receive in their education that can be provided by a school that they can't get in homeschool. You probably are not going to have the same extensive lab equipment for a chemistry lab in your home. �
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:59.680]   in your home as you might at a larger school. Your child is probably going to have a harder time learning Latin when they're studying at themselves at home versus part of a school. And so I'm not opposed to private schools. I think they have benefits. My biggest opposition to private schools is that most of them take the same system as the government school and then just simply say, well, we do it in a slightly safer environment. We have fewer stabbings in class. Or if it's a Christian school, we just have to pay for it.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:29.660]  , and we talk about God doing this thing here. But it's very challenging to find an actual private Christian school that's thoroughly and authentically Christian. And so I get very suspicious. I think they exist. But a lot of times you struggle to see the benefit of most private schools. For example,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:29.420]  obedience.com/subs.html
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   So that doesn't work well in the context of a private school. In addition, the private school doesn't facilitate the same kind of relationship with mom and dad. Especially in the early years, the most important lessons for a child to learn are not academic, they're character and moral lessons. So you can adjust and control the moral environment to a high degree by choosing a private school,
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.500]   The best way to get a good degree in a private school is to take a course in the department of public administration,

[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:29.520]   "I would like to ask you to tell us what you think about the American system and the way in which it is used in the American system."
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   "I think that in general I think that another major problem of many private schools is they're too academically oriented. In my opinion we have too much of a focus on academics in the modern American school system and too little of a focus on practical skills. People say all the time, why didn't they teach us about money in high school?"

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   It's such a waste of time because of all of the stuff associated with it that the child has many more opportunities in homeschooling to develop a diverse array of skills. If you take the average school day, the child rides a bus, 30 minutes on the bus, 15 minutes waiting for the bus. They go, you put together all the subjects. There is such an absolute catastrophic waste of time when the child is waiting on other students, waiting in all the stuff, being held back, having a study hall here, etc. that the child has so much time to develop a diverse array of skills.

[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:29.500]   and they're learning how to write and they're writing short stories or novels or writing magazine articles whether they're writing a blog was there shooting youtube videos I don't know but there are so many opportunities that it's far better especially for a nine-year-old a ten-year-old 11 year old 12 year old it's better to have from 12 30 to 5 30 available for the development of those practical skills than to spend 12 30 to 5 30 sitting in a class listening to a teacher drone on and on when they could have just read the book and taught themselves the the the
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   those are some of the reasons why I'm really optimistic about homeschooling because it just seems much more efficient and I would just add one more thing one of the big benefits of homeschooling also is you get to control the annual calendar now many homeschool students take summers off and I'm not sure if we'll ever take summers off or not I've people argue that it's a good idea people argue that that you should but I personally don't see at the moment why
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   I'm not sure if we'll ever take summers off or not I've people argue that it's a good idea people argue that that you should but I personally don't see at the moment why

[00:43:59.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   and instead of having 180 days of school per year you have 230 days of school per year because you don't have that summer break you don't have all the time wasted of pulling down to summer and then all the time of getting the kids going again but you just do school year round mixed with vacations breaks etc whatever is necessary you can put the child significantly ahead as well that's another under undersung benefit so when you take a much more concentrated focused study time

[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:34.880]   call for today's podcast. I would simply say that it behooves you to become an expert at your money and to use professionals for the things that professionals are good at, but not to expect professionals to be good at the things that they don't do. And so one of the things that I've always tried to do is, especially with my experience in the financial industry, is be very honest about where financial advisors bring a
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:34.880]   and where they bring a lot of value. And so one of the things that I've always tried to do is, especially with my experience in the financial industry, is be very honest about where financial advisors bring a lot of value and where they bring a lot of value and where they bring a lot of value.

[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.120]   It's not going to happen.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:16.520]   So take advisors for where they're good and then fill in the areas with your own personal knowledge and study for where your particular advisor is weak.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   As I close today's show on the topic of education, I want to invite you to come and take a look at my recommended reading list.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.920]   I've put together a book list called Joshua's Financial Freedom Book List.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.480]   There are 12 books on that list.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:05:00.680]  ,
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.420]   but I think that if you read through my list of 12 books, you will have an incredibly strong understanding of the different aspects of finance and a really good foundation to build on. It is impossible to put together a book list that would answer every question. There are so many good books that are left off the list. What I try to do is create a list that for an individual who doesn't know where to start, doesn't know what they've got, that could come and could start reading, go in the order that I recommended to you and you could educate yourself about what you need to know and what you need to know about the book.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:07.260]   in the financial space to put yourself on a plan towards financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:12.360]   If you are interested in that book list, go to RadicalBookList.com.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.120]   Again, RadicalBookList.com.
