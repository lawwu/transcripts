[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.640]   Welcome back to our show, Portfolio Rescue. This is a show where you, the viewers, hand
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.560]   out the topics through your questions. Our inbox is overflowing. Duncan and I don't have
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.240]   enough time to get to all of them. We're trying. If you have a question, email us askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.360]   Reminder, quick disclaimer, this show is for informational purposes only. It should not
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320]   be relied upon for investment decisions. We're filming one day early today because tomorrow's
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.600]   obviously Thanksgiving. Duncan, any big plans?
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.360]   Just getting together with some family and eating some good food.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.680]   All right. Biggest bar night of the year. Yes for you, no?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680]   No.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   It's amateur hour, right?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.560]   Yeah, no. I'm actually running a 5K tomorrow morning.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.120]   Okay, nice. Turkey run, is that what they call it?
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.720]   Yeah, something like that, yeah.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   All right. Remember, it's not just going to be me answering these questions. I'm going
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.440]   to answer some of them on my own, but I also have an expert waiting in the wings who's
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   going to help me. Duncan, let's do it.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   Okay. First up today, Brett writes, "I'm 64 and my wife is 53. Due to good fortune and
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   patience, our savings and investments have appreciated quite a bit over the years. We
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.480]   have $2.1 million in a rollover IRA, that is 75% stocks and 25% cash, $1.65 million
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.360]   in pre-tax accounts held more than a year, and $500,000 of post-tax cash. We also have
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:43.520]   about $1.4 million in home equity with a $175,000 mortgage debt at 2.99%, and neither of us
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.600]   works anymore. The reason I'm writing is that we don't have much in the way of income from
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.760]   our investments, just a lot of capital appreciation primarily from tech stocks.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.000]   I'd like some advice on ways to reapportion these investments into a portfolio that provides
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.440]   more dividends, but in a tax-efficient way."
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   First off, nicely done here. This is a nice-looking portfolio, financial plan. I do want to mention,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.200]   we got a few comments last week about the guy who said, "Hey, I'm selling my house.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.720]   I'm probably going to make half a million bucks on it, but that's not a lot of money."
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.920]   Don't get caught up in the numbers on these questions. This person here, obviously, is
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   doing very well for themselves. They've retired early. They have more than $4 million. They're
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.020]   doing great. I'm more concerned about the decision-making framework here. First of all,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.680]   this person has a tech-heavy portfolio, and it makes sense that they have lower dividends
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.320]   in their portfolio income, because tech stocks tend to have lower dividend yields than more
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   blue-chip stocks.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   For instance, the Nasdaq 100 currently has a dividend yield of about 50 basis points,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.760]   0.5, 0.5%. If you look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that's closer to 2%. Those are more
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.780]   blue-chip stocks. They've been around longer. They're a little more stable. They pay out
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.720]   higher dividends, because most of these tech stocks are reinvesting, because they're such
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.800]   fast-growing companies.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.080]   I think there's two questions you need to ask yourself about this, when you want to
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.520]   go from capital appreciation and growth to more income. Number one, am I looking to add
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.320]   more income to my portfolio because I want to diversify away from tech stocks? That makes
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.560]   sense to me. You've made a lot of gains here. You want to get away. Or, two, am I looking
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.000]   to add more income to my portfolio because I don't want to touch the principal balance?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.320]   That I don't think makes as much sense. Let me show you why.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.940]   So, John, let's do a chart on here of AT&T's dividend yield over time. This is AT&T's dividend
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.100]   yield over the past 10 years. It's really high right now, mainly because the stock has
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.820]   gotten crushed. But the average dividend yield for AT&T stock for the past 10 years is 5.7%.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.340]   You're getting almost 6% dividend yield for 10 years. Now, let's do another chart on.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.020]   This is the return of AT&T stock versus the S&P 500 over 10 years. The S&P is up nearly
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.660]   400%, and this is total return. So, AT&T, they're up about 60%, a little less than 60%,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.580]   with dividends. Basically, that entire return is dividends, because their price is actually
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.180]   down over that time. And so, I just want to make sure that people aren't too caught up
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.940]   in just earning income, because total return is really the only thing that matters. Right?
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.900]   And so, if you're doing this because you think you need more income, that's not always the
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.060]   best answer. Income can play an important role in your portfolio, but total return is
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.100]   the only thing that matters. And I know some people have an aversion to dipping into their
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.680]   principal balance, because they think that something bad is going to happen if they all
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.540]   of a sudden sell. But you can always create your own dividend stream by simply selling
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.260]   shares in stocks or the funds that you own.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.160]   Now, if you want to diversify from tech stocks, that's a different story. Obviously, the simple
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.580]   answer here is just to take some gains from your tax-deferred accounts. You don't pay
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.380]   the capital gains taxes. If you're going to do a portfolio rebalance, do it in the tax-deferred
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.560]   way. Don't take the gains and pay the taxes on them, and then put it into income-producing
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.260]   assets that you're paying taxes on again.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.180]   So, finding reliable income sources is another story. So, you're looking at, okay, dividend-paying
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.140]   stocks, potentially REITs, high-yield bonds, preferred stocks, convertibles maybe. All
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.340]   these things. We've looked into all this stuff. Anything with higher yield right now comes
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.660]   with higher return. That's period, end of story. There's more risk. Most of these other
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.060]   asset classes that have high income also have high drawdowns, like the stock market. So,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.420]   in March 2020, you look at anything that had a high yield, it got crushed, just like the
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.040]   stock market. So, I don't know. If you're really going to look into some of these different
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.000]   income streams and you want to have a more income portfolio, that's fine. Just diversify
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.040]   those streams, probably, because some of them are going to get crushed as well. But also,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.920]   remember, you can make your own dividends. Just sell some shares of your stock. If you're
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.760]   happy with your current strategy, that's fine. You don't have to have dividends in income
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   just because you don't want to touch the principal balance.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.400]   O'Reilly: Yeah. AT&T looks painful when you're looking at it like that.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.840]   Lewis: I think the price is back to 1996 levels. It's tough. It's basically all dividends.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.080]   O'Reilly: Yeah. That fat dividend.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.300]   Lewis: Yeah, that's the thing that brings people in. "Oh, you're getting 8%!" But, also,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.700]   the stock is highly volatile and it's been going down. Okay, let's do the next one.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.100]   O'Reilly: Alright. Up next. "I've worked in financial due diligence at a Big Four accounting
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.740]   firm for the past 11 months and just signed an offer to move to a firm that is growing
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.680]   their own in-house due diligence team very quickly. They offer the same base pay, but
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.120]   the VC opportunity is two to four times what is possible at a Big Four. What is your take
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.460]   on making a move so early in my career?" This is a lot of questions, but I think they're
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.220]   good, so we'll go through them all. "To what extent do you think this type of churn in
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.780]   the financial services industry will continue, given the hot job market? Am I buying high
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.760]   in this cycle and putting myself at risk of being one of the newest employees at a publicly
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.500]   traded firm that could cut labor if things go south? Is the move I'm making worth giving
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.220]   up a more favorable work-life balance in the short term for better long-term earnings potential?"
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.480]   That last one's a big one, right?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.140]   Lewis: First of all, don't look a gift horse in the mouth here. Don't worry about the hot
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.940]   job market. When I came out of college, the job market was awful. So, if you're in a hot
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.360]   job market, don't worry about that. That's a good thing. Also, most career advice is
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.260]   basically useless. Follow your passion, do what I did. Most people don't understand how
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:04.840]   much of their actual career path was based on luck. Sorry. I couldn't have planned out
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.300]   my career path the way it went. If I would have, after college, said, "I'm going to do
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.140]   this, and then I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do this. I'm going to start a
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.420]   blog, and then a podcast comes, and a YouTube channel, all this stuff. I'm going to work
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.320]   for this RIA in New York, and I'm going to live in Grand Rapids." All this stuff that
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.820]   happened in my career was happenstance and luck and hard work. Basically, most of the
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.100]   stuff you get, just follow your passion, says the guy who got a job from his dad, and he's
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.940]   going to take over his manufacturing cram or whatever. The good thing is, you don't
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.220]   have to have it all figured out in your 20s. There's a lot of career paths, especially
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.980]   in the finance field. I think diversifying your opportunity set, first of all, makes
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.540]   a lot of sense. That's number one. I think taking new jobs and diversifying your opportunity
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.100]   set is a good thing. I think it's good to have diversification on your resume. I also
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.420]   think now is the time in your 20s to take a little risk. If you're worried about this
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.500]   company that, well, it could go under, and it's not going to work out, I think now is
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.460]   the time you want to do this. When you're in your 30s and you're more settled down,
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.460]   and you have bigger responsibilities, that's the time where you can't take as many risks.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:06.220]   I also think there's this idea between learning and earning early in your career. My first
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.700]   boss at the internship I had complained about or talked about how he worked at an investment
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.400]   banking shop. In the first 18 months, he said he had three days off total. He was working
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.580]   all these nights and weekends. He had three total days off in the first 18 months, and
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.540]   he wore that as a badge of honor. He thought it was awesome. Me, not being the type A personality
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.260]   like he was, thought, "That sounds awful. I am certainly not going into investment banking."
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.540]   Now, that could also have been because of my GPA, and they probably wouldn't have taken
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:36.660]   me. He said it was basically his MBA. It helped boost his career. I took a different route.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:42.180]   I decided to go to a job that paid me basically nothing. All of my friends after college were
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.420]   earning way more money than me. I got to do a job for three years where I learned a ton.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.260]   I still go back to stuff that I learned in my very first job. I think this idea between
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:57.940]   learning and earning is important. This question is worried about the work-life balance. I
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.340]   think a lot of it depends on your personality. Do you want to be one of these people that's
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.300]   attached to your job? I'm not saying there's a right or wrong answer here, but are you
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.420]   a type A personality that your job and your salary, that's everything to you in your 20s?
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.520]   Some people are like that. That's fine. That wasn't me, but some people are like that.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.980]   I think it depends on what you want to get out of your career and what you want to get
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.260]   out of your youth. Do you want to look back in 10 years and realize, "Geez, I could have
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.300]   had so much more fun in my 20s. Now I'm settling down. I have a family. I think I really wasted
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.940]   those years by working all the time." Or you could say, "Listen, I wanted to work hard
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.180]   in my 20s so I could bump up the baseline of my salary. That way in future years, it's
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.100]   compounded on top of each other in any future job I get. It's starting from a higher baseline
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.420]   because I earn more money." I think it depends what you want to get out of it.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.340]   I've personally never worked a job before where I'm working past 5 o'clock and I'm working
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.020]   on the weekends unless I really wanted to, writing and reading and that sort of stuff.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.980]   I think it really depends on your personality type and if you're that type that really needs
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.060]   to have that. What do you think, Duncan?
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.220]   Yeah. It kind of reminds me of what you guys talk about a lot with retirement in general,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.740]   like doing things today for a day far into the future but trying to make the best balance
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.620]   of your current life with your future life.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.460]   I also think work-life balance is basically bullshit. No one actually has that balance
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.980]   in life because if you spend too much time at work, you're like, "I'm missing out on
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.500]   friends and family and hobbies." If you spend more time with friends and family and hobbies,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.340]   then you're like, "Oh, jeez. I could be working and increasing my career and doing better."
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.260]   There really is no balance for most people. I think most of the time, you just have to
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.180]   kind of vary between each of them.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.420]   Yeah. I agree.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.220]   All right. What's the next one?
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.280]   Next up, question three. Oh, by the way, that last one was from Nick. I didn't mention.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.940]   Next up, we have a question from Glent who writes, "I work in the arts and just lost
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.060]   my job. I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I've saved a decent amount of cash and
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.940]   want to figure out what to do with it. I will be debt-free soon and have saved up with the
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.820]   intention of taking some time off to fund my own film projects. I have about $350,000
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.740]   in personal cash, $300,000 in a business account, and $100,000 in my 401(k). During the pandemic,
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.220]   I put it all into high-interest savings account at about 1.5%, which was good for cash flow,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.900]   but I understand this isn't the best thing, especially with higher inflation. I'm a very
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.140]   light spender, so I can live on about $30,000 a year. Now that I'm unemployed, what should
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.900]   I do with this cash? Ideally, I would like to give myself a bit of income and cash flow
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.100]   during unemployment, as well as invest for the future."
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.820]   By the way, someone in the comments said this must be an NFT artist, which is pretty good.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.340]   This seems like an investment question. It's probably really a personal finance and financial
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.500]   planning question, so I'm actually going to bring in an expert here. Dina Isola, who is
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.780]   a rockstar financial planner for us, is going to help me answer this one because she works
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.280]   with clients of varying financial circumstances. Dina?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.300]   Isola: Hello.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.620]   Lewis: How's it going?
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.340]   Isola: Good! Good to be here.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.420]   Lewis: So, this is a person who has a pretty good financial nut, right? They have a good
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.300]   amount of money set aside. They're out of a job. It sounds like they probably could
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.340]   get another if they wanted to. What are you thinking here? This is almost like they're
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.140]   retired in some way. How do you think about this from a financial planning perspective,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.940]   and also a portfolio management perspective, from keeping this money safe? What do you think?
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.340]   Isola: Well, first of all, I just want to say he's done a really good job because for
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.220]   him the value of money is the freedom it's going to afford him to do these projects that
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.620]   he wants to do. He was very cognizant of that, and in doing that, he stockpiled a lot of
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.060]   cash, which is a very good thing. That being said, he does raise an interesting point,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.940]   which is the whole inflation component. He's got a lot in cash. I'm hoping he didn't mean
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.460]   his 401(k) is in cash as well, because that should be invested differently, obviously.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:41.020]   The key here is he's still going to need quite a bit of cash, because if he expects to be
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.460]   out of the full-time working world doing his project for one to three years, and he's spending
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.980]   about $30,000 a year, I would probably keep about $100,000 in cash.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.140]   Lewis: I was going to ask that. Do you think the best way to go about this is, how many
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.340]   years' worth of spending do I want to keep safe? That gives you an idea of how you can
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.420]   invest the rest of it, right?
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:07.660]   Maxfield: Correct. He needs that cushion, because if he's working on a film and he's
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.260]   not earning income otherwise, he's going to need that money. I'm assuming the business
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.900]   account is paying for the project itself, so there's not too much he's going to be doing
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.620]   with the business account. But I will say this, if he is self-employed, if he doesn't
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.700]   end up working other than doing freelance stuff, he could set up a single K, and the
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:36.340]   business can certainly do some sort of profit sharing with him, a bonus of 25%, and he could
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:42.940]   contribute pre-tax dollars to a solo 401(k). That would be a good thing to do with some
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.100]   of the money as well.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.420]   Lewis: If the film starts making some money, they could still potentially keep saving for
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.820]   retirement along the way in a tax-deferred route.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:56.180]   Maxfield: Exactly. And I would do a Roth. He doesn't say how old he is, but if he's
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:02.020]   under 50, it's $6,000. If he's over 50, it's $7,000. He could fund for this year and next
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   year. That would be a good way to deploy some of that cash. I think IBONZ actually makes
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.500]   a lot of sense. He can do $10,000 in IBONZ if he does it quickly.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.740]   Lewis: Yeah, earning 7% annualized right now, right?
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.740]   Maxfield: Exactly. I think that changes in April, so you have to pay attention to the
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.900]   rates, obviously. You'd want to hold it for at least 12 months. You would also realize
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.420]   that if you forfeit before five years is up, you're going to forfeit three months' worth
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:37.940]   of interest. Not a steep price to pay, but just to be aware of. He does that before year
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:44.580]   end, puts in $10,000, does another $10,000 in the new year, that accounts for $20,000.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.620]   With the rest of the money, I think what I would do there would be, depending upon his
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:55.180]   risk tolerance, I would put it into some sort of balanced and/or more bond-heavy portfolio.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.740]   Lewis: Duncan is a former film professor, right? Duncan went to film school. How risky
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.260]   is this, Duncan, going out of a film project like this?
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:10.180]   Maxfield: Oh, yeah. Most people don't make indie films for money, because it's not a
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.180]   reliable thing to do.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.260]   Lewis: Is it kind of like a kitchen remodel, where you go in budgeting a certain amount
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.420]   and you end up spending 20% more every time?
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:23.980]   Maxfield: 100%. Except instead of 20%, it's usually double. It's risky, but again, it's
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:29.660]   an art. People are doing it for the art, generally speaking. If it makes money, then great. I'd
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.820]   say most people are just happy if they cover their costs.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.700]   Lewis: And Duncan would be happy to publicize it on The Compound if you give him an executive
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.700]   producer credit, right?
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.260]   Maxfield: Yeah, sure. There you go.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.580]   Lewis: Alright, one more question.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:47.540]   Maxfield: Next up, we have a fun one from Oliver, who writes, "I have two teenage boys
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.420]   and I want to show them the basics of financial literacy. For example, compound interest,
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.180]   stocks, bonds, target date funds, etc. Any pointers?"
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:01.540]   Lewis: "Like myself, Dina is a parent of twins. My twins are four. Her twins are now
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.300]   in college. I also have a seven-year-old. Dina, the question I'm trying to ask myself
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.900]   too, like Oliver who has teenage boys, is, what do you think is a good age to start this?"
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.260]   Then we can talk about some of the things that we want to teach these kids. When do
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.060]   you think is a good age to start this? My daughter is seven. The only thing she knows
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.820]   about money now is that she's got some from the Tooth Fairy and she hoards it, so she's
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.700]   a saver like me, which is good. She's hoarding all of her money. She sits there and counts
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.380]   it every day. But when is a good time to start with some of these topics? What are the best
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.380]   topics to start with?
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:35.660]   I'll be honest with you. I probably started talking to children about money maybe prior
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.060]   to even speaking to my own kids about money. I've been going into elementary schools on
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:47.020]   career day and doing personal finance with third graders. The truth of the matter is
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.340]   kids are curious about money. They may not realize that they're curious about money,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.820]   but once you start talking to them about it, time and time again, I watch them light up
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.620]   over it. Because they realize that, A, if they have some money and they know what to
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:06.700]   do with it, they're 10 steps ahead of their friends. Not only their friends, but sometimes
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.020]   adults, quite frankly. It's a great topic to introduce.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:16.740]   When a child is young, like your daughter, it could be allowance. They need to know what
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:23.340]   things cost, what the trade-off is. Suddenly, they become more attentive to how they're
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.580]   spending, why they're spending, what they're spending it on, whether there's a better price
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:34.340]   to be had. They become just more aware. For teenagers, the real takeaway here is they
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.620]   have to earn money. I cannot emphasize that enough. If you think of money like driving
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:48.380]   a car, you wouldn't tell your teenager, "Here are the keys. I gave you a book to read about
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.180]   driving and you've watched a few movies about driving. Now you're ready to go." No. You've
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.460]   got to actually instruct the driving part. The same thing happens with money.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.700]   Earning it is first and foremost the most important thing because they will treat the
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.420]   money differently when it's something that they've actually put some sweat equity in
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.940]   for. I think personal finance probably is more
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.500]   applicable than teaching them about stocks and bonds and saving and investing. Stuff
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.600]   like budgeting and spending and debt and spending-wise. Like you said, how much stuff costs? My kids
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.040]   ask me, "How much does a car cost?" Numbers don't mean anything to them yet. The size
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.140]   of numbers. They don't really get it yet. I do think that simply starting an allowance...
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.980]   Now here's a question for you, Deena, as a parent. Do you automatically give kids allowance
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.620]   or do you make them work for it and do some chores for it?
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.860]   Me personally, I think it's important that they do something for it so that they understand
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:49.420]   that it took them X amount of hours to get X amount of money and then it makes them treat
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   that money very differently. I do. I feel like when you're given money, it's different
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.580]   than if you've earned it. I've seen it with my own children. They're less likely to spend
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.260]   money that they've earned than what has been given to them.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.780]   I think I'm going to give my daughter an allowance and I'm going to make her respond to all the
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.620]   trolls on Twitter that try to actually me. Then she's going to really learn about how
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.260]   people can be in the real world. That's not bad, right?
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.180]   Maybe just set her up on Axie Infinity, right? She can be earning income from playing the
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   game.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.260]   All right. Deena, you have a few compound interest charts here. I do think learning
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.020]   about compound interest is helpful too. So John, why don't we do a chart on here?
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:34.700]   Yeah. So we go into the schools and I watch the eyes just open up really wide when we
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:41.260]   go through this example. So it's an exaggerated example, albeit, okay, because we're compounding
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.620]   it a hundred percent a day and that's just not reasonable. But if you're given a penny
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   every day and it doubles every day over the course of 31 days, we ask the kids, how many
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.180]   pennies do you think you'd have at the end of that timeframe?
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.980]   And the staggering answer, I only had one student actually calculate the number, but
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:06.460]   it's over $10 million. And you say, well, how the heck is that possible? And that is
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.100]   the miracle of compounding. And what I like to point out, and that's why I like to show
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.260]   the numbers that you have here, is that there's a good chunk of time where it's not exciting
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.580]   at all. It's boring as hell and it would probably be very tempting for somebody to say, I'm
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.540]   not going to do this anymore. This is just a waste of my time. And meanwhile, you get
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:30.640]   to about day 16, 17, that's when it really starts to take off. And so if we did this
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.740]   experiment in a 28 day month, it would be worth significantly less. I think it's a little
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:43.580]   over 1 million versus the 10. So that highlights a few things that are very key basic fundamentals
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.140]   to good investing that children need to know. One is it requires discipline. You've got
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.620]   to stick with it. That requires patience. It's going to seem like nothing's going on,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.340]   but that's actually, it's percolating. Be patient. The other thing is their biggest
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.420]   advantage is not their earning potential at this point, it's their time, their youth.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.980]   And they feel kind of disempowered at that age. They're not old enough to do certain
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.140]   things and they can't earn a lot of money. But when you tell them, no, no, no, the biggest
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.500]   thing that you have going for you is time. And here's the evidence. And you show them
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.860]   that chart, it's very, very powerful.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   Yeah. The idea that my daughter always asks, Dad, what do you actually do? And I tell her
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.660]   I help people invest their money and trying to explain that you can make money on money.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.420]   And she's just kind of sitting there, right? That is a concept that is kind of mind blowing.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.340]   If you think about it, I totally agree. All right. I have one more important question
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.880]   before we get out of here. So last year for Thanksgiving, we didn't meet with family because
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.260]   COVID and all that stuff was a big worry. And I talked my wife into making steaks instead
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.220]   of turkey because we weren't going to make a turkey for just us and my kids. Dina, I'm
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.660]   trying to convince my family to go full-time steaks and no turkey for Thanksgiving. What
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.940]   do you think? Is that against the rules or can I pull this off someday?
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.980]   I think you can pull it off. My husband despises turkey to be perfectly honest.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.220]   Thank you. I'm with Tony.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.900]   So yeah. And I'm not a huge turkey fan myself, but I'll do it for tradition. I think people
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.220]   should eat what they want to eat.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.820]   Yes. It's tradition. People do it because they've always done it, right? Duncan, I know
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.420]   you don't eat meat. You can be an impartial observer here.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.340]   Tim Turkey, I guess, yeah.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.340]   Hopefully.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.340]   All right.
