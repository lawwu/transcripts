[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.080]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the first chapter, reading verses 3, 4, and 5.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.040]   Verses 3, 4, and 5 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:32.640]   "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.280]   for us, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.640]   God and our Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   Amen."
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.400]   We come back once more to a consideration of this great statement.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.360]   Those who attend here regularly will know that this is the eighth occasion on which
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.880]   we come back to these three verses and, indeed, the surrounding context in the first half
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.040]   of this most important chapter.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.120]   And we are considering it because it is a very perfect and wonderful summary of the
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.200]   fundamental principles of the Christian faith and of the Christian message.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.280]   I have been indicating that we have them here because the apostle had been driven by circumstances
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.080]   to remind these Galatians of these first principles.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   He had been there preaching.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   He had not been able to stay there very long, but these people had been converted.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   They had been formed into a church or into a number of churches.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.640]   But alas, after the departure of the apostle, other teachers had come along, and they were
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.560]   false apostles, false messengers.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   They had taught this false teaching about the necessity of circumcision and recognizing
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.080]   the law in that respect and so on.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.480]   The poor Galatians were in a state of misery and of unhappiness.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   So the apostle writes to them and expresses his amazement and astonishment that they should
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.700]   so soon thus have turned aside to this other gospel, which is not a gospel, from the grace
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.520]   of Christ.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.400]   And again he therefore reminds them—and he does it at once, you notice—of the essentials
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   of the gospel.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.640]   He is moved in his spirit; he is disturbed.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   He generally has a fairly long introduction in his letters, but not so here.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   He plunges into it immediately and reminds them of the things that rarely matter and
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   count.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.120]   And we have been looking at them together.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.160]   Now the point I am anxious to make is this.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.920]   The gospel is good news.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   And any view we may have of this Christian message, which does not come to us as good
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.720]   news, is of necessity wrong.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.360]   It is of necessity false.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.040]   And what we have been considering is this.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.200]   Why is it that there are so many people who have never thought of the gospel as good news?
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.360]   They have thought of it as a moral code, as a good teaching.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.120]   They have thought of it as something which helps them in this respect and in that, but
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.200]   it has never come to them as good news.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   Why not?
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.360]   Well, the apostle really tells us here, and we have been working through it.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.460]   There are so many who do not regard the gospel as good news because they do not realize the
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.480]   truth about themselves as they are.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.520]   You see, there are sometimes people who have got some terrible physical condition, and
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.280]   they are not aware of it.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.360]   And then they have a growth in him, a malignant, lethal growth in him.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   But he does not know it.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.120]   So he is perfectly happy.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.200]   If he but knew his condition, he would be alarmed.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.040]   He would be running to some doctor, to some surgeon, to have some special treatment.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   But because he is not aware of it, he is perfectly happy.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.120]   Ignorance is an appalling thing.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.480]   And as we have seen, so many have never realized that this is the most wonderful good news
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.440]   that the human ear has ever had the privilege of listening to for this reason, that they
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.800]   have never realized that they are in this present evil world, and that they belong to
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   it, and that they are a part of it, and that the doom which will come upon it will come
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.480]   upon them unless somehow or another they are delivered from it.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.900]   If we have never realized our need of salvation, we will obviously never realize what good
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.280]   news this message is, which tells us about the salvation that has come.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.960]   Now then, let us go on with this.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   This is good news, I say.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.440]   And what is the good news?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.120]   Well, its essence is that God has done something about it, the human predicament.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.200]   You notice how Paul gives all the glory to God.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   He talks about our blessed Lord who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father, to whom be glory forever
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and ever.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   Oh, this is the first element in the gospel always.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.640]   God hath visited and hath redeemed his people.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   That is the essence.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   It is the action of Almighty God, and that is what makes it such a thrilling thing for
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.640]   me or for anybody who is privileged to preach this gospel and to present it.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.000]   We look out upon the world, we read the newspapers, we are aware of the whole situation, we see
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.720]   the hopelessness, the frustration, the attempts, the hopes that always come to nothing.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.160]   This is our privilege, to tell a world that is disappointed and dejected and unhappy that
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:23.000]   God is concerned, the Almighty everlasting and eternal God, has a great plan for redemption.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.120]   He planned it before the very foundation of the world, and how has he executed it?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.400]   Well, in his Son.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.760]   His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he sent into the world, and as we have seen, he has
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:44.640]   done especially this extraordinary thing that happened on the cross, who gave himself for
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   us.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   That is the heart of Christianity.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.760]   That is the good news of salvation.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.400]   Yes, the death of Christ upon the cross, the cross on Calvary's hill, the Son of God
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:07.680]   with his body broken and his blood shed, he gave himself for our sins.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   Well now then, what results for us?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.960]   What has he achieved by giving himself for our sins?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.060]   That is the point we have reached.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.260]   What are the blessings?
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.560]   What is it that is open to us?
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.920]   What is the salvation that he has thus purchased, made possible by giving himself voluntarily,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.760]   freely, to the death of the cross?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.480]   Now I suggested to you last Sunday evening that the answer is really given in three words
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   in my text.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.040]   The first, I am taking them in the reverse order, because the apostle here was writing
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.840]   to believers, and he puts them in his order.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.720]   But as I am approaching it from the standpoint of those who do not believe, we take them
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.240]   in the reverse order.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.760]   What does this gospel do for us?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.640]   Here is the first thing.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.920]   It makes a complete and entire change in our relationship to God.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   And that is the first thing.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.160]   Before you and I begin to talk about happiness or peace or joy or health or anything else,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.920]   the first thing we have got to realize is that we are entities and persons, and we are
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.360]   under God.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.280]   You see, it is so difficult to realize that these days, these days of crowds, these days
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.840]   of the mass, man loses himself in the mass and in the crowd.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.640]   But that is not true.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.960]   God knows us one by one, and we will all have to face him one by one and alone.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.360]   We are individuals, we are entities, we are separate personalities, and we are related
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.960]   to God.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:49.200]   And the terrible thing about mankind, as it is by nature and as the result of sin, is
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.640]   that we are all out of the true relationship to God and under his wrath.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.360]   The world is under condemnation, under the wrath of God, and we are all by nature there.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   So we need to be delivered from that, and we are.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:15.240]   "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world."
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.480]   We are taken out of that position of condemnation and doom, and we are translated into the kingdom
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.240]   of God's dear Son.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.640]   We are forgiven, we are reconciled to God.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.880]   And then we looked at the second word, which is peace.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.280]   Peace.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.880]   Peace with God.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.400]   Peace within.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.120]   What he was doing there, you see, was to take away the enmity.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.320]   He was taking away this barrier of sin that had come between God and men.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.640]   He took it away.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.240]   He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.040]   He was made the divine, the heavenly scapegoat, and he has carried away our sins into the
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   desert of God's forgetfulness.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.800]   And therefore we have peace with God.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   The old enmity has been removed.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:14.320]   Men and God are reconciled, and because of that we have peace within us.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   And we work that out.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   Now I come this evening to this great word that remains, the word grace.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:34.360]   Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.660]   What does this mean?
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.660]   What is this?
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.320]   It is the third term.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.280]   Well now this evening we are interested in it, not as we often are and as we were a few
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:53.320]   Sunday nights ago, as the term that tells us what it is in God that ever made him plan
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.640]   this way of salvation.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   That is grace.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.520]   It is all of grace.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.560]   By grace he has saved.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.900]   Grace is that quality in God that makes him show favor to the utterly undeserving.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:14.500]   That is what grace means, favor to the utterly undeserving.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.900]   But tonight I say we are not interested in it from that standpoint because here it has
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.100]   another connotation.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   Grace be unto you.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.340]   Well, what is this?
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:32.960]   Well, this is a word which describes what becomes possible and open to us because of
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:40.160]   the death of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ upon the cross.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.640]   The Apostle Paul puts it in writing to the Romans in these words.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   "Therefore," he says, "being justified by faith we have peace with God through our
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.760]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:58.040]   And I have had our access into this grace in which we stand."
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.080]   In other words, what he is saying here again is that as a result of the death of our Lord
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.880]   we enter into a relationship of grace with God.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.800]   Yes, we needed forgiveness, we needed reconciliation, but it does not stop at that.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.040]   It gives us an access into this state or condition of grace.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.880]   We are standing, he says now, in grace as a result of the death of our blessed Lord.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.800]   Well, now then, the question is what does that mean exactly?
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:39.440]   What is it to say that the grace of God is open to us and available for us?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.880]   Well, to put it in another way, I can put it like this.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.720]   The death of our Lord Jesus Christ has done this for me.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:57.000]   It has laid open to me all the blessings and the benefits which God has to give a human
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.800]   being.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.640]   And that is, you see, the good news.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.480]   Now then, let us work it out.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.320]   What does it mean?
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:17.680]   Well, it means this, that I can approach God in prayer with confidence, with assurance,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   with boldness.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.360]   Is there anything, I wonder, in life which is more wonderful than this?
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.640]   That we are able to pray with confidence, with assurance.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.960]   We have all known the experience, haven't we?
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.920]   It doesn't matter how forgetful we may have been of God and how sinful a life we have
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   been living.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.760]   Things go wrong, we suddenly find ourselves in a predicament.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.120]   We try everything, nothing avails.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.560]   Then we get on our knees and we begin to pray.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.080]   Oh, but what a wretched experience it is to feel that you are a cad, to feel that you
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   have no right to pray, to feel that you have no claim upon God and that God cannot possibly
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   listen to you.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.480]   You have no confidence in your prayer.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.040]   It is a cry in the dark.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.800]   It is a man whistling to keep up his courage.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.960]   You have no confidence in it.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.360]   You have no faith in it.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.520]   You don't feel that it is of any final value.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.800]   And if at that moment you desire anything above everything else, it is this, isn't
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   it?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.120]   Oh, you say that I knew how I might pray, that I might speak to God and know that he
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.040]   was listening to me and ready to receive me and ready to answer me.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.080]   Well now, what I am saying is that one of the great benefits of grace and one of the
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.640]   great blessings of grace is that as the result of the work of our Lord when he died and gave
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:51.960]   himself upon the cross, I am able to enter into the presence of God with confidence and
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.080]   boldness and even assurance.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.000]   You realize what that means?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.840]   There is nothing, I suppose, about which we are all of us more gravely and seriously mistaken
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   than about this question of prayer.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.320]   It seems to be the simplest thing in the world to pray, doesn't it, in general?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.120]   You have nothing to do but get down on your knees and speak.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.600]   But is that praying?
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   My dear friend, that isn't praying.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.600]   Praying means, I say, that you know you are in the presence of God and that God is there
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   listening to you and ready to help you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.920]   Have you ever considered what it involves?
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.960]   How can a man pray to God?
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:53.720]   God is there in heaven and God is holy and righteous and just and pure.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.040]   God is on the throne of the universe.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.080]   He is the judge eternal, the judge of all the earth.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.680]   How can a man go into the presence of God?
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.000]   How can I venture to approach such a throne?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.440]   We all know what it is to feel nervous in the presence of good and holy people.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.120]   We know what it is to feel nervous in the presence of some great personage in a human
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.960]   sense.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.720]   Men and women feel nervous and apprehensive in the presence of royalty.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.840]   Well, multiply all that by infinities and go on multiplying, and still you have no conception
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.480]   of God.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   How can one therefore go into the presence of God and pray?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.920]   I say this is one of the greatest and most glorious benefits of grace.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.800]   This is one of the most momentous results of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ upon
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:54.560]   the cross, that it enables me to go to the throne of God and know that it is a throne
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   of grace.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:02.200]   That is the very term that is used in the scripture.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.840]   How do I know that?
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.800]   How can I know that I have this access, this entry, into the presence of God when I need
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.560]   him and when I turn to him in prayer?
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   I am sinful.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   I know I am sinful.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   I am unworthy.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.000]   I have nothing to plead in the presence of God.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.160]   To be in the presence of God silences me.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.080]   I know I have nothing to say.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   There is no excuse.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   I have been a fool.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   I have gone my own way.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   I have been like a sheep.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   I have followed the rest.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.360]   And we have all listened to our own desires and spurned the voice divine.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.040]   How can I possibly go to God?
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.000]   How can I stand before that throne, that throne of judgment?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.560]   That throne that is occupied by one of whom this book tells me that he is a consuming
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   fire?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:02.880]   Oh, I say there is only one way in which I can know that this is indeed a throne of grace.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:12.240]   And that is because of what I know of what this Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, did
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.840]   on that cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.040]   I have no knowledge apart from that.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.200]   I say from this pulpit that I know of nothing more terrible than to consider God and be
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.560]   left to myself.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:39.160]   But in this good news of salvation I am told about him.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.920]   And I am told that he gave himself in that way, what for?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:49.880]   To bring me to God, to open a way into the presence of God.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   You see, he is described as a great high priest, isn't he?
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.360]   And that just means this.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.760]   Look at the children of Israel.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.440]   There they were, living a sinful life.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.040]   Suddenly they fear God.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.960]   How can they know that God will continue to bless them?
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.280]   Well, their high priest went in once a year into the tabernacle, into the holiest of all
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.160]   in the tabernacle.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.880]   And he just didn't walk in, you see.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.240]   He went in bearing blood.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:22.080]   He had placed his hands upon the head of an animal, and thereby he had symbolically transferred
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.440]   the sins of all the people, his own included, to the head of that animal.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.600]   Then the animal was slain and the blood was collected, and the high priest went in once
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.480]   a year only into the holiest of all, not without blood.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.200]   Indeed, he carried in the blood of these animals.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.280]   He presented it.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   He offered it.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.880]   The people were outside listening, wondering what was happening to him.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.000]   At long last they'd hear the jingling of the bells at the bottom of his robe, and they
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.560]   knew that he was coming out.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.720]   And what did that mean?
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.840]   That God had accepted the sacrifice.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.040]   That God was covering the sins.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.320]   That God was passing them over, and that they therefore could continue and look for the
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.680]   blessings of God.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   The high priest, that was his work.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   But what you and I know is this, that our high priest is none other than this self-same
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.280]   person who there gave himself for our sins.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:28.880]   He is the offering, the Lamb of God and the high priest at one and the same time.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.800]   And he, this is the thing, has taken his own blood, no longer the blood of bulls and of
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.280]   goats, but his own blood.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.200]   And he's passed through the heavens.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.760]   He's entered into the heavenly tabernacle.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.680]   He's entered into the very presence of God, and has presented his own blood.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.600]   And God has accepted it.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   How do I know that?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.200]   Well, I know that because of the resurrection.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.800]   That is the meaning of the resurrection.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.080]   Here comes the Son of God into the world.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.160]   He works his miracles.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.360]   He can even raise the dead and silence a storm at sea.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.800]   And men begin to believe in him.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.000]   Ah, but they suddenly see him arrested and condemned, and in apparent utter weakness
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.560]   and failure, he's nailed to a tree, and he dies and expires, and they take his body
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.280]   and they put it in a grave.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.320]   And the world, in its cleverness, says, "So much for your Messiah, your Deliverer, your
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   Savior."
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.720]   Ah, yes.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.120]   But wait a bit.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.960]   There comes the morning of the third day.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.120]   The empty grave.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.040]   He bursts asunder the bends of death.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.520]   He arose triumphant.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.640]   Oh, the grave, he couldn't be held of death.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640]   Why?
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   What's it mean?
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.640]   It means this, you see, that God is satisfied with his work.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.920]   He's made the grand atonement.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.080]   The law has been answered finally.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.720]   God is well pleased, and he gives us the evidence by raising him again from the dead.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:11.120]   And in the resurrection, he is proclaiming to the world that the work of his Son, by
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.720]   giving himself upon the cross to death, is more than sufficient.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:26.880]   And therefore I, in my need and in my weakness and in my sin, can venture into the presence
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:36.680]   of God, pleading nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ, his death for me and for my
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   sins.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.280]   That's how I know it.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's become to me a throne of grace.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.880]   God is still just and righteous and holy.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.680]   Yes, but he's punished my sin there.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.840]   And as I look at that cross, I know that he can still be just and justify me.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   He remains just, and yet he can forgive me.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.400]   That's how I'm enabled to go into the presence of God.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.160]   I dare not go otherwise.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.280]   My own conscience accuses me.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.560]   My past sins rise up before me.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.360]   The world condemns me.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.560]   The law of God is against me.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   How can I go?
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.920]   I can only go as I look at him, but looking at him I can go.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:24.400]   Ah, yes, you see, and there's another element in this also.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.560]   I know that he himself is there.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:37.680]   For having made his one offering and sacrifice for sins, he sat down on the right hand of
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.080]   God forever.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:48.680]   We have a high priest there in heaven in the presence of God, ever living to make intercession
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.920]   for us.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.960]   The thought of God alarms me and terrifies me.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.160]   It should.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.800]   And if you're not terrified by thoughts of God, you don't know anything about God.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.920]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   God is a consuming fire.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.960]   But seated at the right hand of God is this person who was made of a woman, made under
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.320]   the law, Jesus of Nazareth, the one who was nailed to that cross.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.680]   He rose again, he ascended into heaven, he's passed through the heavens, and he's seated
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:36.360]   at the right hand of God so that as I go in my weakness and in my feebleness and in my
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.480]   sin, I not only can plead his blood, but I say I am comforted by the thought that he
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:58.200]   is there, touched with a feeling of my infirmities, tempted in all points like as we are yet without
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.480]   sin.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:06.320]   So you see, there is this marvelous boon and blessing that comes to me by the grace of
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:15.960]   Christ, that I can go in prayer with confidence and with assurance into the very presence
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.200]   of God.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.640]   But then there is another thing that follows because of that.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:30.360]   I not only have this access into the presence of God, but I have at the same time this knowledge
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:38.240]   of God as one who loves me.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.440]   Is there anything I say in the world that is more precious than that knowledge?
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:55.480]   That the Lord God of the whole universe loves me when I feel lonely, tired, weary, ashamed,
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:06.040]   forlorn, this wondrous blessed knowledge that God loves me.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.960]   How do I know that God loves me?
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.360]   How easily we talk about the love of God.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.160]   But you see, it is in the Bible, yes, but it is also in the Bible that he is of such
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:22.960]   a pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin, that he is just and holy and righteous.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.240]   How can I know that God loves me?
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.080]   Still, you see, there is only this one answer.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:36.680]   It is only on the cross on Calvary's hill that I can be certain of it.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:43.240]   And that in turn leads me to these further blessings of grace.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:52.640]   I know through all this that God is concerned about me and that God cares for me.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   I cannot know that in any other way.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:02.960]   But as the result of all that I see in Jesus Christ, I am certain of this, that the very
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:14.080]   hairs of my head are all numbered, that God knows all about me, that God knows my every
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.760]   need, my every necessity.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   Did you notice how our Lord taught it?
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.440]   He takes his comparisons of the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   There it is.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:32.880]   He says, "If God so clothed the lily, which today is and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.800]   how much more?"
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.360]   Look at these birds.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.320]   Not one of them, he says, can fall to the ground without my Father.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:49.280]   "Of how much greater value were ye," he says, "than many sparrows?"
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.480]   Now what I am trying to say is this.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:02.600]   Is there any news that is conceivable this evening that in any way compares to this?
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:10.800]   Here we are in life with its problems and its perplexities pressing in upon us.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.080]   And then there comes perhaps sin and shame and failure and heartbreak and a feeling that
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.560]   nobody can help you.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.320]   For nobody can help you.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.560]   The heart knoweth its own bitterness.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.760]   Or you are visited with grief and sorrow.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.160]   Everything around you seems to collapse and your world suddenly vanishes and disappears.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.000]   And no one can help you and you are alone.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Now what can you do?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Well, here is the answer.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.160]   That God knows all about you.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   That God sees your every need even in a way that you do not see it yourself.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.400]   That he is interested in you, you as an individual that have become lost in the mass, you that
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.440]   have become a cipher in the modern state with its welfare.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.400]   God is interested in you individually, is concerned about you, has numbered the very
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.800]   hairs of your head and has told you that nothing can happen to you but that he knows all about
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   it.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.480]   It cannot happen to you apart from his will.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.760]   And then add this on top of it.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.320]   These you see are the blessings and the boons and the benefits of grace.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:36.000]   This God who knows you and who loves you and who is concerned about you has all power.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.760]   It is not surprising, therefore, that this apostle should say in writing to the Ephesians,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:51.880]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.600]   according to the power that worketh in us.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.480]   That is it.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:05.320]   He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or even think.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.120]   At the highest stretch of your imagination you cannot get there.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.320]   He is endless, illimitable in his power.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.320]   He has made everything out of nothing.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.080]   This God knows you, he loves you, he is concerned about you.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.040]   "Ah," says Paul again to those same Ephesians, "I am praying for you.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.200]   I am praying," he says, "that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened."
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   Why?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   Well, for these reasons.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.480]   That you may know what is the hope of his calling, what is the riches of the glory of
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:47.800]   his inheritance in the saints, and thirdly, the exceeding greatness of his power to us
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.880]   that believe.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.160]   And what is the exceeding greatness of this power?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.640]   Well, he says it is the same power which he used and implied when he brought the Lord
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:04.280]   Jesus Christ up again from the dead and raised him up into the heavenly places far above
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:10.640]   all principalities and powers and might and dominion and every name that is named, not
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.760]   only in this world but also in that which is to come.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.600]   Well then, here it is.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:23.080]   All the power of that God is available for us.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.400]   The God who loves us, the God who is interested, the God who is concerned is a God of such
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.960]   a power.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:39.480]   And that power is working to us who believe in his Son who gave himself for us and for
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:46.040]   our sins there upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.160]   My friend, the question I am asking you is this.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.640]   Does that come to you as a thrilling piece of good news?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.560]   If it doesn't, you see, it means, I say again, you don't realize the truth about
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   yourself.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.160]   You don't realize your need.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.480]   You don't realize your desperate plight.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.320]   But if you do, is there anything comparable to this?
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.580]   That this God is looking upon you.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.240]   You can go into his presence and speak to him.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.480]   He is concerned.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.820]   He loves you.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:26.160]   And his mighty power is working for you and for your aid and for your deliverance.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.920]   That is the second thing.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.680]   And then I must mention just this other thing.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.960]   The apostle puts it here in a very striking phrase.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:41.640]   He says, "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.720]   grace of Christ."
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   What does that mean?
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:52.580]   Well, the apostle is never tired of speaking about this.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:33:00.600]   He sometimes refers to it as the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.800]   He says, "I am a preacher of the gospel.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.120]   I have been sent amongst the Gentiles."
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   What for?
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:13.880]   Well, he says, "To tell them about the unsearchable riches of Christ, the grace of
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   Christ."
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.440]   What is this?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   Well, it includes all the things that I've just been talking about.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.800]   But it goes beyond all that.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.320]   For to be a Christian doesn't merely mean that my sins are forgiven and that I now am
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.080]   reconciled to God and am able to pray to him and to go into his presence with confidence
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.400]   and assurance and boldness.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   What else?
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:46.560]   Well, here is something that an age of preaching can never exhaust.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.280]   Let me mention just one thing to you this evening.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:34:02.800]   What this book calls the new birth, regeneration, being made a new man, a new person.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.520]   This apostle puts it in the very last chapter of this very epistle that we are considering
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   in these words.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.520]   Listen.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:17.000]   He says, "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   a new creature, a new creation, the blessings of salvation, the good news of the gospel."
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   What is it?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.520]   "That I am made, as the result of the death of Christ upon the cross, a new creature."
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.720]   It opens that possibility to me.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.440]   Now then, let me expound this.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.880]   The apostle also puts it in the second chapter of this great epistle in verse 20.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.920]   He says, "I am crucified with Christ.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.280]   Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:03.960]   And the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.160]   and who gave himself for me."
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   What does it mean?
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   What is Christianity?
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.560]   Ah, yes, it means I am forgiven.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.880]   It means I am reconciled.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.320]   It means I can pray.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.680]   But it means something, I say, that is infinitely more wonderful in a sense.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:29.520]   It means that I am a new man, a new being, a new creature, a new creation.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.520]   What is it to live the Christian life?
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.200]   Is it just this?
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.920]   That whereas I lived a heedless, thoughtless, sinful life, I now come and read the Sermon
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   on the Mount and I try to practice it and I try to put it into operation?
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.160]   No, no, that is not Christianity.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.600]   That is impossible.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.760]   You cannot live the Sermon on the Mount by your own strength and power.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   No man can.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.120]   It is impossible.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   No man could keep the Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.120]   No, no, Christianity does not just mean trying to imitate Christ and to follow him, because
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.080]   we cannot.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   What does it mean then?
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:13.840]   It means this, that I am made a new being, a new person.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.080]   I am crucified with Christ.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.840]   Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:28.000]   Nothing matters in Christ but a new creature, a new creation.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.920]   Had you realized that one of the blessings offered you because the Son of God died and
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:39.760]   the cross for you are sins, is that you can have an absolutely new start in this world,
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:47.280]   a new beginning, that such a change is wrought in you that you will scarcely recognize yourself?
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.000]   That is the very thing that is offered.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.040]   What is this?
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.120]   What is this new birth, says someone?
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.320]   What do you mean by talking about a new creature?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   Oh, I mean this, that Christ, by dying there and taking my sins away, has put me into this
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:10.520]   relationship with God, that God's power begins to act in me, that the Holy Spirit begins
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:17.280]   to work an operation upon me, that I become born of the Spirit, no longer in the flesh,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   but in the Spirit.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   This, I say, is one of the most glorious truths concerning this faith.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:33.160]   It means this, that a new principle of life is put into me.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.880]   Oh, how can I make this plain to you?
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.040]   I find so many people think of Christianity simply like this.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.720]   Ah, they say, "I know I have sinned, and I believe your message that Christ died upon
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.640]   the cross and that therefore my sins can be forgiven."
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.680]   And then they think they have got to try and live this new life in their own strength,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.840]   and as they are, but they cannot do it.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.360]   No man can do it, I say.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:06.040]   Here comes this wonderful message about the regeneration, the rebirth, this renewal in
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:14.840]   the Spirit, this receiving of a new principle of life, a new disposition, a new outlook,
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.680]   a new governing principle in the very depth of my being.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:27.580]   That is why the Bible speaks about it as a rebirth or a new creation.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:34.960]   In other words, something is put into me that was not there before.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.920]   I am aware of a new life within.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.680]   I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   That is it.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.700]   I am made a new man.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.720]   So with Paul I look at myself and I say, "I am myself, yet I am not myself.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.880]   I live yet not I."
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   Now that is Christianity.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.840]   That is the good news.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.520]   Not just that you are forgiven and left to face the world, the flesh, and the devil by
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.400]   yourself and know you are going to fail as before.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:08.160]   No, no, no, new man, new principle, new disposition, new outlook, new everything.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.480]   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.880]   All things have passed away.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.200]   Behold, all things have become new.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.640]   This is the thing that is offered us as the result of his death.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:29.880]   I am given a new mind, a new mentality, a new outlook.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.400]   Is there somebody in this congregation listening to me who holds this view?
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.480]   Alas, I am afraid there are probably many.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   Christianity, yes, the great spoiled sport of life, that thing which if I could but finish
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.280]   with it I would be glad to do, but I am afraid of God.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   I do not like it.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   It is narrow.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.560]   It stops everything I want to do and asks me to do things I do not want to do.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.640]   Now there are many who think of Christianity like that and they are just holding on to
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.600]   it as some sort of insurance policy.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.640]   They are afraid to give it up.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.680]   But my dear friend, that is not Christianity.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   I will tell you what Christianity is.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:20.440]   It is this regeneration, this new birth, the receiving of a new life, a new mind, a new
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   outlook.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   Do you know, once you have got this new mind, you will want to live a holy life.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.440]   You will hate sin.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.760]   You will see through this present evil world and you will not want it.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.800]   You will see that it drags you down and it ruins you and comes between you and God.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.320]   You will have a new mind, a new outlook.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   You will have new desires.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.880]   You will hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.200]   Yes, you know, you will even begin to enjoy reading the Bible, the most boring book in
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.440]   the world, as you think it is now.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.560]   You will even begin to enjoy prayer.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.680]   You will begin to enjoy the society of God's people and prefer it to the greatest in the
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   land who are not God's people.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.680]   That is Christianity.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.080]   And it comes, you see, because you have received a new life.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.960]   You are no longer what you were.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:17.280]   There is this new disposition, this new governing principle of the whole of your outlook, your
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   mind, your heart, your will, your everything.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:34.720]   And once this happens, you begin to find yourself desiring God, desiring to know God above everything
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.440]   else, desiring to please him, desiring to be like him.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.360]   You long for holiness.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:47.840]   People say his commandments are not grievous.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.720]   Very well, that is the next thing, and add this to it.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:42:03.320]   You will become conscious that the Holy Spirit of God is dwelling within you, that you are
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.120]   not left to yourself any longer.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.280]   The apostle puts it perfectly in the fifth chapter of this great epistle in verse seventeen.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:19.720]   To him he says, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, yes, but thank God the Spirit
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.480]   lusteth also against the flesh.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.880]   And these are contrary, the one to the other.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   Thank God for that."
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.160]   What does it mean?
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.920]   It means this.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:42.560]   "Here I am in this world, longing and seeking to live this good life, but finding the world
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.480]   and the flesh and the devil against me, the flesh lusting against all that and getting
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:56.280]   me down and leading me ever to failure and remorse and misery and unhappiness and shame.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.760]   Can I never get out of it?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.880]   Am I doomed to perpetual failure?"
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.120]   Here is the answer.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   "In this new birth the Spirit comes into me, and the Spirit, you see, lusteth against
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   the flesh.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.360]   I am no longer alone in this fight.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:22.160]   The Holy Spirit of God is within me, fighting against everything that gets me down.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.600]   That is the good news of salvation.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.200]   Men and women, don't you rejoice to hear this?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.800]   Haven't you felt weary in the battle?
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.440]   Haven't you felt ashamed of yourself?
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.200]   And you make your resolutions and break them, and it is up and down and more down than up.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.680]   Isn't this the best news you have ever heard, that here comes the Holy Spirit of God within
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.800]   you to lust against your lusts, to fight the battle within you?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   That is the good news.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:57.280]   It is Christ, by dying upon the cross, that has made this a possibility.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.400]   And then, you see, the Spirit does other things.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:07.640]   He worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.000]   You see, once you become a Christian, once you have this new life and the Spirit of God
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.600]   is in you, do you know the Spirit works in you when you are not aware of it?
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.760]   You may be sitting down, you may be reading a book, suddenly you will feel an impulse
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.040]   to go and pray.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   Where did it come from?
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   The Spirit.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.720]   He will move your mind in the direction of God.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.840]   He will bring holy thoughts to you.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.680]   He will urge you to read the Bible, to go and talk to some saint.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:41.360]   He worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:51.240]   And above all, he gives us power which enables us to become victors in this fight.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.720]   In other words, for me to close and to sum it up, I will put it like this.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:08.880]   He gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, not
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:19.280]   only from its doom and the destruction which is certainly coming upon it, but he delivers
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:29.480]   us from its mentality, its outlook, its whole way of living, even at this present time.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:37.520]   That is what Christianity means, that I am taken out of that and put into this other.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:45.000]   God forbid, says this apostle, that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.800]   Christ by which the world has been crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.320]   Wouldn't you like to be delivered from the world?
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.160]   Wouldn't you like to be free from its enticements and attractions and all that belongs to it
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.080]   that gets you down and fills you with this shame and sense of unworthiness?
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.680]   It is the cross of Christ that does it, says Paul.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:21.840]   It crucifies the world unto us and it crucifies us unto the world, and not only the world
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.120]   and the flesh, but the devil.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:32.560]   Here is the power that is set against us, the power that brought down Adam in his perfection
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:38.520]   and Eve, the power that tackled all the patriarchs and subdued every one of them.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:44.680]   Here is a power that is so great that he didn't even hesitate to tempt the Son of God himself.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.160]   He didn't succeed, but he tried.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.480]   He tried his utmost.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.680]   No man has ever been able to withstand him, and he is against us.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.440]   He is ever round and about us, insinuating his thoughts, his suggestions, his innuendos,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.040]   dragging us down, the world, the flesh.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.320]   The devil?
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   How can I stand against the devil?
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.680]   The answer is still in the same place.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:19.720]   By this power that is given me, by the indwelling Holy Spirit, by the Christ that is in me,
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.440]   I can even resist the devil.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:30.800]   "Yes," says Peter to believers, "your adversary the devil is a roaring lion, roams about seeking
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.480]   whom he may devour."
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   What do I do about him?
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.680]   "Whom resist, steadfast in the faith."
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:43.600]   "Resist the devil," adds James, "and he will flee from you."
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:50.040]   Is it possible that the one who could bring down an Adam and an Eve will flee from me?
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.360]   Of course, because I am not alone.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.880]   Christ is in me, the Spirit is in me.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:03.720]   They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:09.960]   These are the blessings of salvation.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.600]   These are aspects of the grace of Christ.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:20.000]   These are portions of the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.760]   Young man, young woman especially, in the fight, in the thralldom of it all, in the
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:30.680]   defeat of it all, isn't this good news for you?
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:42.960]   Delivered from this present evil world in all its mentality and outlook and enticements
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:54.680]   and hellish power, and at the same time made meat to be partakers of the inheritance of
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.640]   the saints in light.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.600]   This is the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.320]   He died, why?
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.720]   That we might be forgiven.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.160]   Yes, he died to make us good.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.760]   He died to deliver me from hell.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.920]   Yes, but also to prepare me for heaven.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:27.080]   He died to deliver me from this present evil world, but in addition to translate me into
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:37.000]   his own kingdom and to make me a partaker of his own divine nature, to make me a citizen
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:46.200]   of his eternal kingdom, now invisible, but which will come in visible glory when he comes
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:53.400]   back again into this sinful world, finally to judge it, to purge it of evil, and to set
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:59.440]   up his own reign forever and forever.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:14.920]   Such is the grace of God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us,
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:26.320]   that he might deliver us from this present evil world and introduce us into that realm
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:33.200]   of grace and of glory.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:40.560]   My dear friend, the matter is as simple as this.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:51.280]   This is either the best good news you have ever heard, or else it is nothing to you.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.880]   It is one or the other.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:02.640]   And if it is nothing to you, it is because you are still in this present evil world and
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:07.960]   you do not know it, and you do not know what is awaiting you.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.600]   You have not considered God, you have not considered your death, you have not considered
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   the judgment, you do not know.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:26.680]   But if you do know, is there anything like this, all this and infinitely more, given
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:32.920]   to us freely, without money and without price?
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:45.320]   We simply acknowledge our need and turn to him, confessing our sins, beseeching his mercy,
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:54.080]   and he will shower upon us the riches of his grace.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:02.920]   The Son of God went to that cross in order to open for you the door into the treasure
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:08.040]   house of God's eternal grace.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.560]   Are you enjoying any of it?
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.000]   Have you the peace with God?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.920]   Have you got peace in your own heart?
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.000]   Do you know God?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.040]   Have you confidence in your prayers?
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.400]   Can you turn to God in the hour of need and of desperation with real assurance?
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.240]   Have you felt his presence within you and around and about you?
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.200]   Have you got a new view of life in this world?
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.960]   Are you aware of a new power within you, enabling you to resist the world, the flesh, and the
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.480]   devil?
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.160]   Are you beginning to experience and to enjoy these things that are offered to you?
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.280]   Christ died that you might have them freely, and you have but to realize your need and
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.120]   to go to him and apply to him.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:04.880]   And he will receive you and begin to pour upon you of the riches of his grace.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.800]   Go to him.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.120]   Make no tarrying.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:17.040]   Begin tonight to taste of the heavenly riches.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.640]   Amen.
