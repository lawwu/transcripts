[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Well, we're gonna close out the week
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.240]   with a good, honest question
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.360]   from a podcast listener named Seth.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.400]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   I believe intellectually that learning about God
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   can provide a greater joy
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.540]   than whatever temporary pleasures I may get
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.520]   from the many distractions that this world has to offer,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   and I have experienced times in my life where it has.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.960]   However, these times are generally short-lived
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.200]   and expire very quickly.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000]   Could you give me some tips on how to be more satisfied
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.480]   in the things of the Lord than in the things of the world,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.320]   and in a way that endures?
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.400]   I know that spending hours watching television
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.360]   or playing games throughout the day is a waste of my time,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.480]   yet I struggle to stop doing these things.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.720]   Please help, Pastor John.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   - Well, let me begin by congratulating Seth
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.480]   with the simple and glorious fact
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.080]   that he believes there are such things as things of the Lord.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   That very phrase causes some younger Christians
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.500]   to just gag because they're on a crusade
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.320]   to demonstrate that all things are the things of the Lord,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.840]   so why are you talking about being more happy
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.880]   in things of the Lord?
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   Well, it is true that the earth is the Lord's
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   and everything in it, and in that sense,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.520]   all things are things of God,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.680]   but we all know that there's a difference
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280]   between balancing your checkbook
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.560]   and pondering a sweet promise of God.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.840]   We know there's a difference between the rising
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.560]   of the stock market and the saving of a soul
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.040]   through the gospel, and we know that our joys
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.760]   ought to be greater in a promise
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.000]   than in a balanced checkbook,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.860]   and we know that our joy ought to be greater
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.900]   in the salvation of a soul
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.600]   than the rising of the stock market,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.720]   so Seth is onto something,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   and he's onto something because he's onto the Bible.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.760]   For example, Colossians 3,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.840]   "If then you have been raised with Christ,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.240]   "seek the things that are above,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.360]   "where Christ is seated at the right hand of God."
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960]   Set your mind on things that are above,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.760]   not on things that are on the earth,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.360]   so there's a difference, and he's asking,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.560]   "How can I delight more in things that are above,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   "not the things that are on the earth?"
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.480]   Or Matthew 16, 23, Jesus says to Peter,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.600]   "Get behind me, Satan, you are a hindrance to me,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.180]   "for you are setting your mind on the things of man
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.000]   "and not the things of God."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880]   So Jesus made that distinction,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.360]   or 1 Corinthians 2, 11, Paul says,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720]   "No one comprehends the things of God
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.120]   "except the Spirit of God."
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.820]   So congratulations, Seth, for asking an important question
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.920]   in biblical categories that are incredibly important.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.720]   So you ask, "Could you give me some tips
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.380]   "as to how to be more satisfied in the things of the Lord
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.980]   "than the things of the world?"
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.700]   And I think maybe the most helpful thing I could do
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.540]   is to bring you into something God is teaching me afresh
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.260]   at age 70 that I should not have to be taught again
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680]   after 60 years as a Christian.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.020]   So I have one tip for you, I'm sorry, just one.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.580]   Can do this again another time for more tips,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.900]   but this is the one that's just so front burner
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.400]   for me right now.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.540]   And I'm gonna give you one tip and then six reasons
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.500]   for why it really matters.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.460]   Here's the tip.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.580]   When you read your Bible every day,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.900]   pause before you read
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.120]   and earnestly, with as much heartfelt longing
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   as you can muster, pray to God that he would come
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.060]   and meet you in the reading of Scripture
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.820]   and open the eyes of your heart
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.340]   and show you what is really there and make himself real
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820]   and bring about amazing changes in your life.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.820]   Or to put it very simply, pray earnestly
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.300]   about the reading of Scripture
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.700]   just before you read the Scripture.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.380]   It's amazing, after all these years,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.380]   how many times I simply start reading without praying.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.500]   And I can tell the difference profoundly.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   So here's what I believe you can expect if you do this.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.100]   Number one, in answer to this prayer about the Word of God,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.620]   as you begin to read, or the sheer fact of prayer,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.460]   God creates a supernatural atmosphere.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.660]   He opens you to the fact that this moment
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.100]   is not just about you and a book,
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.420]   it's about you and the living God.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.420]   By his Spirit, encountering his very voice,
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.200]   experiencing his supernatural presence in a manifest way,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.180]   many Christians long for supernatural experiences,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.840]   and this is one that you can ask for and expect.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.300]   Number two, in answer to this prayer about the Bible,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.100]   as you begin to read the Bible,
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.500]   God will open the eyes of your heart
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   to see things in the Word that you would not otherwise see.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.700]   You have not because you ask not,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.140]   applies to Bible reading,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.860]   and you have because you ask,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.080]   applies to the very words of the Bible.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   The very words of the Bible will take on new dimensions.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.340]   They will signify things, point to things,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.300]   awaken you to the reality of things
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.580]   that would otherwise not be so.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.940]   You wouldn't see them otherwise.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.940]   Most of us are blind to the glories embedded by God
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.040]   in the very words that he has given us
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.340]   as we read them so casually.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.220]   Reading the word Spirit, the word glory,
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.220]   the word cross, sin, without praying is one experience.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.440]   Reading those words after praying
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.040]   may be cataclysmically different,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.240]   a different kind of seeing in those same words.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.880]   Number three, if you pray,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.720]   God will open your heart to feel the preciousness
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.580]   of glorious things and the horror of evil things
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.000]   that you would not otherwise feel.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.680]   Most of us do not feel emotions
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   that accord with the realities we're thinking about.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.560]   This is a work of the Spirit,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.680]   and he does it in answer to prayer.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.240]   Number four, in answer to this prayer over the Bible,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.000]   before we read it, God will work changes in you
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   that you would not otherwise experience.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.860]   I mean, changes in your warfare with sin,
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.200]   changes in your desires for holiness,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.080]   changes in your habits that need conquering,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.120]   and changes in your capacities for relationships,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.880]   and changes in your experience
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.640]   of the fruits of the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.800]   love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.320]   meekness, faithfulness, self-control.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.740]   Where do these come from?
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.840]   They come from the work of the Spirit
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.940]   in and through the word, and I'm arguing,
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.920]   if you ask him, he will do this.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.360]   Number five, if you pray this prayer
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.840]   at the beginning of your Bible reading,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   God will, from time to time,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.920]   provide the very guidance and leading
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.560]   that you have been longing for
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.740]   in regard to big decisions in your life.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.520]   God delights to bring fresh vision and guidance
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   into the life of his children
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.680]   while they're spending time with him and his word,
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   and he does it if we ask him to help us as we read.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.680]   And finally, number six, in answer to that prayer
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.560]   over our reading, before we read,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   God will give you a fresh sense of his reality.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   I know this because it happens to me.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.840]   It happened to me this morning in a wonderful way.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.720]   I was reading Psalm 122, and I read the phrase,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.640]   "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem,"
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.040]   and my thought turned,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.240]   and I totally was not expecting or planning this,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.040]   my thought turned not to the political situation
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.880]   in the Middle East, but to the desperate lostness
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.360]   of millions and millions of Jewish people,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.680]   right here in my city and around America
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.360]   as well as around the world,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.520]   the millions of Jewish people
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.680]   who reject Jesus as their Messiah.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.160]   Jesus made it so clear during his lifetime
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   that if people, including Jewish people, reject him,
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.800]   they reject life.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.160]   And the reality of God, the God of Israel,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.240]   the God of salvation, the God of heaven and hell,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.960]   the God who will one day lift the veil off of Israel
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.640]   and take away the hardness of heart became so real to me.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.040]   And I prayed earnestly that God would open the eyes
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.680]   of Jewish people and show me how I can be better used
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.800]   in this way.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   I was totally unready for this experience at that moment
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.560]   when I read that phrase.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.720]   And I hope and I pray it will have an ongoing effect on me,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.840]   and I think God did that because I had paused
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   and prayed that God would speak to me during this psalm
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.880]   through his inspired words.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.120]   So Seth, that's my one tip, and I'll say it again.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.040]   When you read your Bible every day,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.480]   pause before you read,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.360]   and earnestly, with as much heartfelt longing
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   as you can muster, pray to God that he would come
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.120]   and meet you in the reading of Scripture
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.040]   and open the eyes of your heart
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.200]   and show you what is really there and make himself real
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.440]   and bring about amazing changes in your life.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.240]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for this simple
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   but profoundly important tip for Bible reading
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.480]   and to fuel our delight in God.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.520]   May God open our eyes to behold
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.280]   wonderful things in his word.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.000]   Well, it is time for the weekend and time for us to break,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.320]   but on Monday, we return to the topic of Scripture
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.720]   because we have a listener who wants to know
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.360]   if the circumstances of Paul's epistles,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.400]   the letters that he wrote to very specific people
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.880]   and very specific cities
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.200]   and into very specific sets of circumstances,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.480]   does all of that specificity render those epistles
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.080]   less relevant for our lives today?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   And how would we know?
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.920]   It's a good question.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.600]   John Pepper will pick it up on Monday.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you on Monday.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
