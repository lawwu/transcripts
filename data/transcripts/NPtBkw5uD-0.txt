[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   It's not our business to change the Russian government.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.240]   And anybody who thinks it's a good idea to do regime change in Russia, which has more
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.560]   nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.120]   And Vladimir Putin himself has said, "We will not live in a world without Russia."
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.960]   And it was clear when he said that that he was talking about himself.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   And he has his hand on a button that could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.800]   So why are we messing with this?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.960]   It's not our job to change that regime.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.720]   And we should be making friends with the Russians.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.480]   We shouldn't be treating them as an enemy.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   Now we've pushed them into the camp with China.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.360]   That's not a good thing for our country.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.680]   And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.840]   The following is a conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.240]   candidate for the President of the United States, running as a Democrat.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.800]   Robert is an activist, lawyer, and author who has challenged some of the world's most
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.040]   powerful corporations, seeking to hold them accountable for the harm they may cause.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   I love science and engineering.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.480]   These two pursuits are, to me, the most beautiful and powerful in the history of human civilization.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.960]   Science is our journey, our fight for uncovering the laws of nature and leveraging them to
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.560]   understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.400]   Some of the greatest human beings I've ever met, including most of my good friends,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.240]   are scientists and engineers.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.800]   Again, I love science.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   But science cannot flourish without epistemic humility, without debate,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   in good faith, long-form conversations.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.320]   Agree or disagree, I believe Robert's voice should be part of the debate.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.760]   To call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he says
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320]   without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.360]   topics like the pandemic is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.480]   I recommend that people read and listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his arguments and his ideas.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.320]   But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation, that people read and listen to
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.360]   Vincent Recaniello from This Week in Virology, Dan Wilson from Debunk the Funk,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.440]   and the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.120]   in their disagreement with Robert.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.560]   It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.680]   In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.800]   but we must have the humility to hear it and to learn from it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.280]   It's the Fourth of July, Independence Day, so simple question, simple big question.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.800]   What do you love about this country, the United States of America?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.320]   I would say, well, there's so many things that I love about the country.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   You know, the landscapes and the waterways and the people, etc., but on the kind of a,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.480]   you know, the higher level, you know, people argue about whether we're an exemplary nation.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.880]   And that term has been given a bad name, particularly by the neocons, the actions,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.080]   the neocons in recent decades who have turned that phrase into kind of a justification
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.400]   for forcing people to adopt American systems or values at the barrel of a gun.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.520]   But my father and uncle used it in a very different way, and they were very proud of it.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.080]   I grew up very proud of this country because we were the exemplary nation in the sense that we
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   were an example of democracy all over the world.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.200]   When we first launched our democracy in 1780, we were the only democracy on earth.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.000]   And by the Civil War, by 1865, there were six democracies.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.000]   Today, there's probably 190.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.080]   And all of them, in one way or another, are modeled on the American experience.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.440]   And it's kind of extraordinary because sort of our first contact with, our first serious and
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   sustained contact with the European culture and continent was in 1608 when John Winthrop
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.800]   came over with his Puritans in the Slough Barbella, and Winthrop gave this famous speech
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   where he said, "This is going to be a city on a hill.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.800]   This is going to be an example for all the other nations in the world."
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.680]   And he warned his fellow Puritans.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:29.280]   They were sitting at this great expanse of land, and he said, "We can't be seduced by
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   the lure of real estate or by the carnal opportunities of this land.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.480]   We have to take this country as a gift from God and then turn it into an example
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.400]   for the rest of the world of God's love, of God's will and wisdom."
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.840]   And then 200 years later, 250 years later, a different generation, they were mainly deists,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:12.320]   or people who had a belief in God, but not so much a love of particularly religious cosmologies.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:20.240]   You know, the framers of the Constitution believed that we were creating something that would be
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.920]   replicated around the world, and that it was an example.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.560]   In democracy, there would be this kind of wisdom from the collective, you know,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.800]   that—and the word "wisdom" means a knowledge of God's will—and that somehow God would speak
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:45.360]   through the collective in a way that he or she could not speak through totalitarian regimes.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.000]   And, you know, I think that that's something that even though
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.800]   Winthrop was a white man and a Protestant, that every immigrant group who came after them
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.960]   kind of adopted that belief.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.600]   And I know my family, when, you know, art from my family came over, all of my grandparents came
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.720]   over in 1848 during the Potato Famine, and they saw this country as unique in history, as something
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.760]   that, you know, that was part of kind of a broader spiritual mission.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:30.320]   And so I'd say that from a 30,000-foot level, you know, that's—I grew up so proud of this country
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.760]   and believing that it was the greatest country in the world, and for those reasons.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.680]   - Well, I immigrated to this country, and one of the things that really embodies America to me
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.760]   is the ideal of freedom.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.440]   Hunter Thompson said, "Freedom is something that dies unless it's used."
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.720]   What does freedom mean to you?
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.120]   - To me, freedom does not mean, you know, chaos, and it does not mean anarchy.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:01.840]   It means that it has to be accompanied by restraint if it's going to live up to its promise
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.000]   and self-restraint.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:16.560]   What it means is the capacity for human beings to exercise and to fulfill their creative energies
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400]   unrestrained as much as possible by government.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.640]   - So this point that Hunter S. Thompson made is "dies unless it's used."
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   Do you agree with that?
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.920]   - Yeah, I do agree with that.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.720]   And I think, you know, he was not unique in saying that.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.080]   You know, Thomas Jefferson said that the Tree of Liberty had to be watered with the blood
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.200]   of each generation, and what he meant by that is that you can't live off—we can't live off
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.120]   the laurels of the American Revolution.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.640]   That, you know, we had a group, we had a generation where between 25,000 and 70,000 Americans died.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.560]   They gave their lives, they gave their livelihoods, they gave their status, they gave their
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   property, and they put it all on the line to give us our Bill of Rights.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.120]   And that—but those Bill of Rights, the moment that we signed them, there were forces within
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.080]   our society that began trying to chip away at them.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.560]   And that, you know, happens in every generation, and it is the obligation of every generation
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.680]   to safeguard and protect those freedoms.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.000]   - The blood of each generation.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   You mentioned your interest, your admiration of Albert Camus, of Stoicism, perhaps your
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.360]   interest in existentialism.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.160]   Camus said, I believe in myth of Sisyphus, "The only way to deal with an unfree world
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.040]   is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion."
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.240]   What do you think he means by that?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.920]   - I suppose the way that Camus viewed the world and the way that the Stoics did and
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:05.200]   a lot of the existentialists was that it was so absurd and that the problems and the tasks
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   that were given just to live a life are so insurmountable that the only way that we can
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:21.520]   kind of get back the gods for giving us this, you know, this impossible task of living life
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.120]   was to embrace it and to enjoy it and to do our best at it.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.800]   I mean, to me, I, you know, I read Camus and particularly the myth of Sisyphus as a, as
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.080]   kind of a, as a parable that, and it's the same lesson that I think he writes about in
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:50.000]   "The Plague" where we're all given these insurmountable tasks in our lives, but that
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.160]   by doing our duty, by being of service to others, we can bring meaning to a meaningless
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.440]   chaos and we can bring order to the universe.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:10.560]   And, you know, Sisyphus was kind of the iconic hero of the Stoics, and he was a man, because
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.360]   he did, because he did something good, he delivered a gift to humanity, he angered the
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.640]   gods and they condemned him to push a rock up the hill every day and then it would roll
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.960]   down, when he got to the top, it would roll down and he'd spend the night going back down
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.000]   the hill to collect it and then rolling it back up the hill again.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.560]   And the task was absurd, it was insurmountable, he could never win, but the last line of that
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.160]   book is one of the great lines, which is, which is something to the extent that, you
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:50.480]   know, I can picture Sisyphus smiling, because Camus' belief was that even though he, his
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.600]   task was insurmountable, that he was a happy man, and he was a happy man because he put
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.960]   his shoulder to the stone, he took his duty, he embraced the task and the, you know, and
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   the absurdity of life and he pushed the stone up the hill.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   And that if we do that, and if, you know, we find ways of being of service to others,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.280]   that is, you know, the ultimate, that's the key to the lock, that's the solution to the
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.840]   puzzle.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.600]   Each individual person in that way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning to
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.200]   this whole messy thing.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   And we can bring meaning not only to our own lives, but we can bring meaning to the universe
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:40.640]   as well, we can bring some kind of order to life, and, you know, that, those, the embrace
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.840]   of those tasks and the commitment to service resonates out from us to the rest of humanity
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.240]   in some way.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.200]   - So you mentioned "The Plague" by Camus.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.680]   There's a lot of different ways to read that book, but one of them, especially given how
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:06.880]   it was written, is that the plague symbolizes Nazi Germany and the Hitler regime.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   What do you learn about human nature from a figure like Adolf Hitler, that he's able
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.320]   to captivate the minds of millions, rise to power, and take on pulling the whole world
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.280]   into a global war?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.400]   - I was born nine years after the end of World War II, and I grew up in a generation that
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   was, you know, with my parents who were fixated on that, on, you know, what happened, and
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   my father.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.960]   At that time, the, you know, the kind of the resolution in the minds of most Americans,
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.920]   and I think people around the world, is that there was, there had been something wrong
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.440]   with the German people, that, you know, the Germans had been particularly susceptible
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:04.960]   to this kind of demagoguery and to following a powerful leader and to industrializing cruelty
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.160]   and murder.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.400]   And my father always differed with that.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.200]   My father said, "This is not a German problem.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.840]   This could happen to all of us.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.360]   We're all just inches away from barbarity, and the thing that keeps us safe in this country
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.640]   are the institutions of our democracy, our constitution.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.880]   It's not our nature.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:39.280]   Our nature has to be restrained, and that comes through self-restraint, but it also
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.440]   you know, the beauty of our country is that we develop, we devise these institutions that
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:53.040]   are designed to allow us to flourish, but at the same time not to give us enough freedom
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   to flourish, but also create enough order to keep us from collapsing into barbarity.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.880]   So, you know, one of the other things that my father talked about from when I was little,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:14.880]   you know, he would ask us this question, "If you were the family and Anne Frank came
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.760]   to your door and asked you to hide her, would you be one of the people who hit her and risk
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.360]   your own life, or would you be one of the people who turned her in?"
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.720]   And of course, we would all say, "Well, of course, we would hide Anne Frank and take
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.280]   the risk."
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.680]   But, you know, that's been something, kind of a lesson, a challenge that has been, that
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.400]   has always been near the forefront of my mind, that if a totalitarian system ever occurs
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.440]   in the United States, which my father thought was quite possible, he was conscious about
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:57.280]   how fragile democracy actually is, that would I be one of the ones who would resist the
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.800]   totalitarianism, or would I be one of the people who went along with it?
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:11.520]   Would I be one of the people who was at the train station in, you know, Krakow, or, you
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:20.400]   know, even Berlin, and saw people being shipped off to camps, and just put my head down and
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:26.160]   pretend I didn't see it, because talking about it would be destructive to my career
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.240]   and maybe my freedom and even my life.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.400]   So, you know, that has been a challenge that my father gave to me and all of my brothers
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.200]   and sisters, and it's something that I've never forgotten.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.160]   >> A lot of us would like to believe we would resist in that situation, but the reality
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.840]   is most of us wouldn't, and that's a good thing to think about, that human nature is
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.720]   such that we're selfish, even when there's an atrocity going on all around us.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.960]   >> And we also, you know, we have the capacity to deceive ourselves, and all of us tend to
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.400]   kind of judge ourselves by our intentions and our actions.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.680]   >> What have you learned about life from your father, Robert F. Kennedy?
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.480]   >> First of all, I'll say this about my uncle, because, you know, I'm going to apply that
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.920]   question to my uncle and my father.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.680]   My uncle was asked when he first met Jackie Bouvier, who later became Jackie Kennedy,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.400]   she was a reporter for a newspaper, and she was doing, she had a kind of column where
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:39.600]   she'd do these kind of pithy interviews with both famous people and kind of men in the
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.400]   street interviews.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   And she was interviewing him, and she asked him what he thought, what he believed his
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.520]   best quality was, his strongest virtue, and she thought that he would say courage, because
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.400]   he had been a war hero.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.680]   He was the only president who, and this is when he was senator, by the way, who received
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:10.480]   the Purple Heart, and, you know, he had a very kind of famous story of him as a hero
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.240]   in World War II, and then he had come home and he had written a book on moral courage
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.040]   among American politicians, and won the Pulitzer Prize.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:25.360]   That book, "Profiles in Courage," which was a series of incidents where American
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:32.800]   political leaders made decisions to embrace principle, even though their careers were
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   at stake, and in most cases were destroyed by their choice.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.320]   She thought he was going to say courage, but he didn't.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.680]   He said curiosity.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:49.200]   And I think, you know, looking back at his life, that the best, that that, it was true,
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.080]   and that was the quality that allowed him to put himself in the shoes of his adversaries.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.280]   And he always said that if you, if the only way that we're going to have peace is if
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.160]   we're able to put ourselves in the shoes of our adversaries, understand their behavior
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:16.400]   and their context, and that's why he was able to, you know, during the, he was able
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.160]   to resist the intelligence apparatus and the military during the Bay of Pigs when they
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.400]   said, "You've got to send in the S-6, the aircraft carrier," and he said no, even
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.280]   though he'd only been in two months in office, he was able to stand up to them because
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.560]   he was able to put himself in the shoes of both Castro and Khrushchev and understand
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.480]   there's got to be another solution to this.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.840]   And then during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was able to, and the narrative was, okay,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:54.960]   Khrushchev acted in a way as an aggressor to put missiles in our hemisphere.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.320]   How dare he do that?
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.200]   And Jack and my father were able to say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.800]   He's doing that because we put missiles in Turkey and Italy that were right on, you
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.960]   know, the Turkish ones right on the Russian border."
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.920]   And they then made a secret deal with Dobrynin, with Ambassador Dobrynin and, you know, with
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:25.200]   Khrushchev to remove the missiles in Turkey, if he moved the Jupiter missiles from Turkey
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   so long as Khrushchev removed them from Cuba.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.160]   There were 13 men on the executive, on the end, what they call the ENCOD committee, which
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.960]   was the group of people who were deciding, you know, what the action was, what they were
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.360]   going to do to end the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:52.000]   And virtually, and of those men, 11 of them wanted to invade and wanted to bomb and invade.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.080]   And it was Jack and then later on my father and then Bob McNamara, who were the only people
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.600]   who were with him, because he was able to see the world from Khrushchev's point of
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.680]   view, he believed that there was another solution.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   And then he also had the moral courage.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:20.240]   So my father, you know, to get back to your question, famously said that moral courage
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.400]   is the most important quality and it's more rare than courage on the football field
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.640]   or courage in battle than physical courage.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   It's much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important quality in a human
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.280]   being.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.120]   And you think that kind of empathy that you referred to, that requires moral courage?
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:46.320]   It certainly requires moral courage to act on it, you know, and particularly, you know,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.760]   in, you know, anytime that a nation is at war, there's kind of a momentum or an inertia
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.520]   that says, okay, let's not look at this from the other person's point of view.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.400]   And that's the time we really need to do that.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.120]   - Well, if you're going to apply that style of empathy, style of curiosity to the current
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.720]   war in Ukraine, what is your understanding of why Russia invaded Ukraine in February
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.360]   2022?
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.440]   - Vladimir Putin could have avoided the war in the Ukraine.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.080]   His invasion was illegal.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.560]   It was unnecessary and it was brutal.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:33.840]   But I think it's important for us to move beyond these kind of comic book depictions
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:46.000]   of this insane, avaricious Russian leader who wants to restore the Soviet empire.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.800]   And that that's why, and it was, and who made it an un-provoked invasion of the Ukraine.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:01.840]   He was provoked and we were provoking him, and we were provoking him for, since 1997.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.880]   And it's not just me that's saying that.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:13.840]   I mean, when, and before Putin ever came in, we were provoking Russians in this way unnecessarily.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   And to go back to that time in 1992, when the Russians moved out of, when the Soviet
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.480]   Union was collapsing, the Russians moved out of East Germany and they did that, which was
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.600]   a huge concession to them.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.840]   They had 400,000 troops in East Germany at that time, and they were facing NATO troops
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.960]   on the other side of the wall.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.840]   So Gorbachev made this huge concession where he said to George Bush, "I'm going to
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.880]   move all of our troops out and you can then reunify Germany under NATO," which was a
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:51.360]   hostile army to the, to the Soviet, it was created to, you know, with hostile intent
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.560]   toward the Soviet Union.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.080]   And he said, "You can take Germany, but I want your promise that you will not move
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.040]   NATO to the East."
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   And James Baker, who was his Secretary of State, famously said, "I will not move
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.440]   NATO, we will not move NATO one inch to the East."
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.760]   So then five years later in 1997, this is a big Nobrizinski, who was kind of the father
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.480]   of the neocons, who was a Democrat at that time, served in the Carter administration.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:28.800]   He said, he published a paper, a blueprint for moving NATO right up to the Russian
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.880]   border, a thousand miles to the East, and taking over 14 nations.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:42.240]   And at that time, George Kennan, who was the, kind of the deity of American diplomats, he
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.040]   was probably, arguably, arguably the most important diplomat in American history.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.560]   He was the architect of the containment policy during World War II.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.440]   And he said, "This is insane, and it's unnecessary.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.280]   And if you do this, it's going to provoke the Soviet, I mean, the Russians to a violent
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.080]   response.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   And we should be making friends with the Russians.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.360]   They lost the Cold War.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.720]   We should be treating them the way that we treated our adversaries after World War II,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.280]   like with a Marshall Plan to try to help them incorporate into Europe and to be part of
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.800]   the brotherhood of, you know, of man and of Western nations.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   We shouldn't continue to be treating them as an enemy, and particularly surrounding
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.520]   them at their borders."
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   William Perry, who was then the Secretary of Defense under Bill Clinton, threatened
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.160]   to resign.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.120]   He was so upset by this plan to move NATO to the East.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.720]   And William Burns, who was then the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who's now,
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   at this moment, the head of the CIA, said at that time the same thing.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.240]   "If you do this, it is going to provoke the Russians toward a military response."
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   And we moved it.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   We moved all around Russia.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:03.200]   We moved to 14 nations, 1,000 miles to the East, and we put Aegis missile systems in
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.880]   two nations, in Romania and Poland.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.680]   So we did what, you know, what the Russians had done to us in 1962 that would have provoked
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.800]   an invasion of Cuba.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.120]   We put those missile systems back there, and then we walk away unilaterally, walk away
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.760]   from the two nuclear missile treaties, the intermediate nuclear missile treaties that
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.200]   we had with the Soviet Union, with Russia, when neither of us would put those missile
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   systems on the borders.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.280]   We walk away from that, and we put Aegis missile systems, which are nuclear-capable.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   They can carry the Tomahawk missiles, which have nuclear warheads.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   So the last country that they didn't take was the Ukraine, and the Russians said, and
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:51.760]   in fact Bill Perry said this, or William Byrne said it, so now the head of the CIA, "It
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.200]   is a red line.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.600]   If we go into, if we bring NATO into Ukraine, that is a red line for the Russians.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   They cannot live with it.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.400]   They cannot live with it.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.000]   Russia has been invaded three times through the Ukraine.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.120]   The last time it was invaded, we killed, or the Germans killed one out of every seven
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.600]   Russians.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:16.800]   They destroyed my uncle described what happened to Russia in his famous American University
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   speech in 1963, 60 years ago this month, or he said, or last month, 60 years ago in June,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.000]   June 10th, 1963.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.600]   He told, that speech was telling the American people, "Put yourself in the shoes of the
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   Russians."
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.680]   We need to do that if we're going to make peace.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.200]   And he said, "All of us have been taught that we won the war, but we didn't win the
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.520]   war.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.120]   The Russians, if anybody won the war against Hitler, it was the Russians.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.520]   Their country was destroyed.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:56.960]   All of their cities," and he said, "Imagine if all of the cities on the east coast of
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.080]   Chicago were reduced to rubble, and all of the fields burned, all of the forests burned.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.840]   That's what happened to Russia.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.600]   That's what they gave so that we could get rid of Adolf Hitler."
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.200]   And he had them put themselves in their position.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.360]   And today, there's none of that happening.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.280]   We have refused repeatedly to talk to the Russians.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.640]   We've broken up, there's two treaties, the Minsk Agreements, which the Russians were
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.440]   willing to sign, and they said, "We will stay out."
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.360]   The Russians didn't want the Ukraine.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:36.080]   They showed that when the Donbas region voted 90 to 10 to leave and go to Russia, Putin
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.680]   said, "No, we want Ukraine to stay intact, but we want you to sign the Minsk Accords."
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:48.960]   The Russians were very worried because of the U.S. involvement in the coup in Ukraine
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.920]   in 2014.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   And then the oppression and the killing of 14,000 ethnic Russians.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.920]   And Russia hasn't met the same way that if Mexico put Aegis missile systems from China
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.240]   or Russia on our border and then killed 14,000 expats American, we would go in there.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.800]   He does have a national security interest in the Ukraine.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.960]   He has an interest in protecting the Russian-speaking people of the Ukraine, the ethnic Russians.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.520]   And the Minsk Accords did that.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.600]   It left Ukraine as part of Russia.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.880]   It left them as a semi-autonomous region that could continue to use their own language,
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.600]   which is essentially banned by the coup, by the government we put in in 2014.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.040]   And we sabotaged that agreement.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   And we now know in April of 2022, Zelensky and Putin had inked a deal already to another
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.280]   peace agreement, and that the United States sent Boris Johnson, the neocons in the White
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.520]   House, sent Boris Johnson over to the Ukraine to sabotage that agreement.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.000]   So what do I think?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.520]   I think this is a proxy war.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.320]   I think this is a war that the neocons in the White House wanted.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.640]   They've said for two decades they wanted this war, and that they wanted to use Ukraine
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.880]   as a pawn in a proxy war between the United States and Russia, the same as we used Afghanistan.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.240]   And in fact, they say it, this is the model.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.920]   Let's use the Afghanistan model.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.200]   That was said again and again, and to get the Russians to overextend their troops and
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.440]   then fight them using local fighters and U.S. weapons.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.960]   And when President Biden was asked, why are we in the Ukraine, he was honest.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.360]   He says to depose Vladimir Putin, regime change for Vladimir Putin.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:56.080]   And when his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, in April 2022 was asked, you know, why are
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.680]   we there, he said to degrade the Russians' capacity to fight anywhere, to exhaust the
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.480]   Russian army and degrade its capacity to fight elsewhere in the world.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.680]   That's not a humanitarian mission.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.200]   That's not what we were told.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.040]   We were told this was an unprovoked invasion, but, and that we're there to bring humanitarian
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.480]   relief to the Ukrainians.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.920]   But that is the opposite.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.760]   That is a war of attrition that is designed to chew up, to turn this little nation into
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:32.720]   an abattoir of death for the flower of Ukrainian youth in order to advance a geopolitical ambition
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.880]   of certain people within the White House.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.360]   And, you know, I think that's wrong.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.120]   We should be talking to the Russians the way that, you know, Nixon talked to Brezhnev,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.440]   the way that Bush talked to Gorbachev, the way that my uncle talked to Khrushchev.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.920]   We need to be talking with the Russians, we should, and negotiating.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   And we need to be looking about how do we end this and preserve peace in Europe.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.880]   - Would you, as president, sit down and have a conversation with Vladimir Putin
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.440]   and Vladimir Zelensky separately and together to negotiate peace?
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.480]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.800]   - What about Vladimir Putin?
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.760]   He's been in power since 2000.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.200]   So as the old adage goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.720]   Do you think he has been corrupted by being in power for so long?
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.280]   If you think of the man, if you look at his mind?
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.080]   - Listen, I don't know exactly.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:37.280]   I can't say because I just, I don't know enough about him or about, you know,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:44.400]   I, my, the evidence that I've seen is that he is homicidal.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.120]   He kills his enemies or poisons them.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:54.000]   And, you know, the reaction I've seen to that, to those accusations from him,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.360]   have not been to deny that, but to kind of laugh it off.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.520]   I think he's a dangerous man and that, of course, you know,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.880]   there's probably corruption in his regime.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   But having said that, it's not our business to change the Russian government.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   And anybody who thinks it's a good idea to do regime change in Russia,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:22.320]   which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.080]   And, you know, Vladimir Putin himself has said, you know,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.720]   we will not live in a world without Russia.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.640]   And it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:40.640]   And he has his hand on a button that could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.480]   So why are we messing with this?
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.640]   It's not our job to change that regime.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.400]   And we should be making friends with the Russians.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.160]   We shouldn't be treating them as an enemy.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   Now we've pushed them into the camp with China.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.960]   That's not a good thing for our country.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.840]   And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.520]   Putin now, you know, if you believe the polls that are coming out of Russia,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.760]   they show him, you know, the most recent polls that I've seen,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:18.800]   show him with that 89% popularity that people in Russia support the war in Ukraine.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.120]   And that, and they support him as an individual.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.760]   So, and I understand there's problems with polling and, you know,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.440]   you don't know what to believe, but the polls consistently show that.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.000]   And, and I, you know, it's not America's business to be the policeman of the world
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.600]   and to be changing regimes in the world.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.120]   That's illegal or not.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.360]   We shouldn't be breaking international laws.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:51.840]   You know, we should actually be looking for ways to improve relationships with Russia,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.600]   not to, you know, not to destroy Russia, not to destroy and not to choose its leadership for them.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.920]   That's up to the Russian people, not us.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.360]   So step one is to sit down and empathize with the leaders of both nations to understand
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.200]   their history, their concerns, their hopes,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.960]   just to open the door for conversation.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.720]   So they're not back to the corner.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.520]   And I think the U.S. can play a really important role.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.960]   And a U.S. president can play a really important role by
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.640]   reassuring the Russians that we're not going to consider them an enemy anymore,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.760]   that we want to be friends.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.400]   And it doesn't mean that you have to let down your guard completely.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.440]   The way that you do it, which was the way President Kennedy did it,
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   is you do it one step at a time.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   You take baby steps.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:44.800]   We do a unilateral move to reduce our, you know, our hostility and aggression
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.120]   and see if the Russians reciprocate.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.240]   And that's the way that we should be doing it.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:56.400]   And, you know, we should be easing our way into a positive relationship with Russia.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.160]   We have a lot in common with Russia, and we should be friends with Russia
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.360]   and with the Russian people.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.920]   And, you know, apparently there's been 350,000 Ukrainians
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.440]   who have died, at least, in this war.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:16.240]   And there's probably been 60 or 80,000 Russians.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.480]   And that should not give us any joy.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.960]   It should not give us any, you know, I saw Lindsey Graham on TV saying,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.000]   you know, anything we can, something to the extent that anything we can do to kill Russians
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.280]   is a good use of our money.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.160]   That, it is not.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.240]   You know, those are somebody's children.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.320]   They're, you know, we should have compassion for them.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.120]   This war is an unnecessary war.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.360]   We should settle it through negotiation, through diplomacy, through statecraft,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.000]   and not through weapons.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.600]   Do you think this war can come to an end purely through military operations?
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.080]   No, I mean, I don't think there's any way in the world that the Ukrainians can beat the Russians.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.240]   I don't think there's any appetite in Europe.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.560]   I think Europe is now, you know, having severe problems in Germany, Italy, France.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.680]   You're seeing these riots.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   There's internal problems in those countries.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:19.440]   There is no appetite in Europe for sending men to die in Ukraine.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.920]   And the Ukrainians do not have anybody left.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:27.520]   The Ukrainians are using press gangs to, you know, to fill the ranks of their armies.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:33.760]   Men, military-age men, are trying as hard as they can to get out of the Ukraine right now,
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.120]   to avoid going to the front.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:41.040]   The front, you know, the Russians apparently have been killing Ukrainians at a seven to one ratio.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.920]   My son fought over there, and he told me it's, you know, artillery.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:54.080]   He had firefights with the Russians, mainly at night, but he said most of the battles were
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:03.120]   artillery wars during the day, and the Russians now outgun the NATO forces ten to one in artillery.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.800]   Oh, they're killing at a horrendous rate.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:14.240]   Now, you know, my interpretation of what's happened so far is that Putin actually went in early on
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.240]   with a small force because he expected to meet somebody on the other end of a negotiating table
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:29.280]   that once he went in, and that when that didn't happen, they did not have a large enough force
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.920]   to be able to mount an offensive.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.560]   And so they've been building up that force up till now, and they now have that force.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.400]   And even against this small original force, the Ukrainians have been helpless.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.360]   All of their offenses have died.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:52.240]   They've now killed, you know, the head of the Ukrainian Special Forces, which was probably,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:59.680]   arguably, by many accounts, the best elite military unit in all of Europe.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:11.200]   The commandant, the commander of that Special Forces group, gave a speech about four months
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.640]   ago saying that 86 percent of his men are dead or wounded and cannot return to the front.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.160]   He cannot rebuild that force.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:27.120]   And, you know, the troops that are now headed, that are now filling the gaps of all those
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:35.920]   350,000 men who've been lost are scantily trained, and they're arriving green at the front.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.520]   Many of them do not want to be there.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.400]   Many of them are giving up and going over the Russian side.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.800]   We've seen this again and again, including platoon-sized groups that are defecting to
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.440]   the Russians.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.520]   And I don't think it's possible to win.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.960]   And anybody, you know, I saw, of course, I've studied World War II history exhaustively,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:06.160]   but I saw a, there's a new, I think it's a Netflix series of documentaries that I highly
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.040]   recommend to people.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:14.400]   They're colorized versions of the black and white films from the battles of World War
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.160]   II, but it's all the battles of World War II.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:23.280]   So I watched Stalingrad the other night, and, you know, the willingness of the Russians
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:33.760]   to fight on against any kind of allies and to make huge sacrifices of Russians, the Russians
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.520]   themselves, who are making the sacrifice with their lives, the willingness of them to do
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.560]   that for their motherland is almost inexhaustible.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:48.240]   It is incomprehensible to think that Ukraine can beat Russia in a war.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.960]   It would be like Mexico beating the United States.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.480]   It's just, it's impossible to think that it can happen.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.040]   And, you know, Russia has deployed a tiny, tiny fraction of its military so far.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:08.000]   And, you know, now it has China with its mass production capacity supporting its war effort.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.680]   It's just, it's a, it's a hopeless situation.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.640]   And we've been lied to, you know, we're the press in our country and our government are
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.160]   just, are just, you know, promoting this lie that the Ukrainians are about to win and that
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.920]   everything's going great and that Putin's on the run.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.760]   And there's all this wishful thinking because of the, the Wagner group, you know, the, the
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.720]   Rogozhin and the Wagner group that this was an internal coup and it showed dissent and
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.600]   weakness of Putin.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.040]   And none of that is true.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:46.480]   I was a, that insurgency, which wasn't even an insurgency, only got 4,000 of his, of his
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.240]   men to follow him out of 20,000.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.840]   And they were quickly stopped and nobody in the Russian military, the oligarchy, the political
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.320]   system, nobody supported it, you know, and by we're being told, oh yeah, it's the beginning
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.760]   at the end for Putin.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.360]   He's weakened, he's wounded, he's on his way out.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.560]   And all of these things are just lies that we are being fed.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.600]   - So to push back on a small aspect of this that you kind of implied, so I've traveled
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:18.160]   to Ukraine and one thing that I should say, similar to the battle of Stalingrad, it is
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.680]   just not, it is not only the Russians that fight to the end.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.120]   I think the Ukrainians are very willing to fight to the end and the morale there is quite
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.320]   high.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.560]   I've talked to nobody, this was a year ago in August with Herson, everybody was proud
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.160]   to fight and die for their country.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.760]   And there's some aspect where this war unified the people to get, gave them a reason and
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   an understanding that this is what it means to be Ukrainian and I will fight to the death
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.640]   to defend this land.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.520]   - I would agree with that and I should have said that myself at the beginning.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.680]   That's one of the reasons my son went over there to fight because he was inspired by
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.080]   the valor of the Ukrainian people and this extraordinary willingness of them.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.480]   And I think Putin thought it would be much easier to sweep into Ukraine and he found
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:12.560]   a stone wall of Ukrainians where they're ready to put their lives and their bodies
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:12.960]   on the line.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:22.160]   But that to me makes the whole episode even more tragic is that I don't believe, I think
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:32.320]   that the US role in this has been, that there were many opportunities to settle this war
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.080]   and the Ukrainians wanted to settle it.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:41.120]   Vladimir Zelensky when he ran in 2019, here's a guy who's a comedian, he's an actor.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.800]   He had no political experience and yet he won this election with 70% of the vote.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.200]   Why?
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:54.240]   He won on a peace platform and he won promising to sign the Minsk Accords and yet something
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.680]   happened when he got in there that made him suddenly pivot.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.000]   And I think it's a good guess what happened.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.480]   I think he was, he came under threat by ultra-nationalist nationalists within his own administration
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.920]   and the insistence of neocons like Victoria Nuland in the White House that, you know,
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.040]   we don't want peace with Putin, we want a war.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.920]   Do you worry about a nuclear war?
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   Yeah, I worry about it.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.200]   It seems like a silly question but it's not.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.360]   It's a serious question.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.400]   Well, the reason it's not, you know, the reason it might, it's not, it's just because people
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:42.800]   seem to be in this kind of dream state about that it'll never happen and yet, you know,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.680]   it can happen very easily and it can happen at any time.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.880]   And, you know, if we push the Russians too far, you know, I don't doubt that Putin, if he felt
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:02.160]   like his regime was in, you know, or his nation was in danger, that the United States was going
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:11.920]   to be able to place, you know, a quizzling on, you know, into the Kremlin that he would use nuclear,
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:20.640]   you know, torpedoes and, you know, these strategic weapons that they have and that could be the
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.120]   be it.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.320]   Once you do that, nobody controls the trajectory.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:31.920]   By the way, you know, I have very strong memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis and those 13
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:38.720]   days when we came closer to nuclear war, you know, and particularly I think it was when the U-2 got
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:46.000]   shot down over Cuba, you know, and nobody in this country, there's a lot of people in Washington,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.400]   D.C. who at that point thought that they very well may wake up dead, that the world may end
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.120]   at night.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.160]   30 million Americans killed, 130 million Russians.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.680]   This is what our military brass wanted.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.840]   They saw a war with Russia, a nuclear exchange with Russia as not only inevitable but also
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:14.000]   desirable because they wanted to do it now while we still had superiority.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.840]   Can you actually go through the feelings you've had about the Cuban Missile Crisis?
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.440]   Like what are your memories of it?
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.720]   What are some interesting kind of--
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.320]   You know, in the middle of, I was going to school in Washington, D.C. to Sidwell, or to
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.680]   Our Lady of Victory, which is in Washington, D.C.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.160]   So we were, I lived in Virginia across the Potomac and we would cross the bridge every
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.120]   day into D.C.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:44.800]   And during the crisis, U.S. Marshals came to my house to take us, I think around day
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.300]   eight.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.320]   My father was spending the night at the White House.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.520]   He wasn't coming home.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.760]   He was staying with the ex-com committee and sleeping there and they were up, you know,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.960]   24 hours a day.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.760]   They were debating and trying to figure out what was happening.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.520]   And, but we had U.S. Marshals come to our house to take us down.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:13.200]   They were going to take us down to White Sulphur Springs in southern Virginia in the Blue Ridge
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:19.920]   Mountains where there was a, there was an underground city, essentially a bunker that
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:25.040]   was like a city and apparently it had McDonald's in it and a lot of other, you know, it was
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.080]   a full city for the U.S. government and their families.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.000]   U.S. Marshals came to our house to take us down there and I was very excited about doing
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.240]   that.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.000]   And this was at a time, you know, when we were doing the drills, we were doing the
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.480]   duck and cover drills once a week at our school where they would tell you if they, you know,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.560]   when the alarms go off, then you put your head onto the table, you take the, remove
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.840]   the sharps from your desk, put them inside your desk, you put your head onto the table
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.320]   and you wait and the initial blast will take the windows out of the school and then we
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.200]   all stand up and file in an orderly fashion into the basement where we're going to be
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.040]   for the next six or eight months or whatever.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:14.160]   But in the basement where, you know, we went occasionally in those corridors were lined
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.240]   with freeze-dried food canisters up to the ceiling, from floor to ceiling.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.840]   So people were, you know, we were all preparing for this and it was, you know, Bob Magnum
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.240]   Arrow, who was my, was a friend of mine and, you know, was my father, one of my father's
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.920]   close friends, the Secretary of Defense, he later called it mass psychosis.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.360]   And my father deeply regretted participating in the bomb shelter program because he said
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:46.720]   it was part of a, you know, a psychological psy-op trick to treat, to teach Americans
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   that nuclear war was acceptable, that it was survivable.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.360]   But my father, anyway, when the, when the Marshals came to our house to take me and
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:02.800]   my brother Joe away, and we were the ones who were home at that time, my father called
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.560]   and he talked to us on the phone and he said, "I don't want you going down there because,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:14.080]   because if you disappear from school, people are going to panic.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.400]   And I need you to be a good soldier and go to school."
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.600]   And he said something to me during that period, which was that if a nuclear war happened,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.720]   it would be better to be among the dead than the living, which I did not believe.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:36.480]   Okay, I mean, I had already prepared myself for the, you know, for the dystopian future.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:42.320]   And I knew I could, I spent every day in the woods, I knew that I could survive by catching
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.200]   crawfish and, you know, cooking mud puppies and do whatever I had to do.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.720]   But I felt like, okay, I can, I can handle this.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:57.040]   And I really wanted to see this set up down in, you know, this underground city.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.520]   But anyway, that was, you know, part of it for me.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.240]   My father was away and, you know, the last days of it,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.680]   my father got this idea because Khrushchev had sent two letters.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.960]   He sent one letter that was conciliatory.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:19.840]   And then he sent a letter that after his joint chiefs and the warmongers around him
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.280]   to solve that letter, and they disapproved of it, they sent another letter that was extremely
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:23.840]   belligerent.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:30.720]   And my father had the idea, let's just pretend we didn't get the second letter and reply to
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.360]   the first one.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:39.760]   And then he went down to Dobrynin, and who was, he met Dobrynin in the Justice Department.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.280]   And Dobrynin was the Soviet ambassador.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.840]   And they, you know, they proposed this settlement, which was a secret settlement
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.720]   where Khrushchev would withdraw the missiles from Cuba.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.200]   Khrushchev had put the missiles in Cuba because we had put missiles, you know, nuclear missiles
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.760]   in Turkey and Italy.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:06.320]   And my uncle's secret deal was that if he, if Khrushchev removed the missiles from Cuba,
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   within six months he would get rid of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.840]   But if Khrushchev told anybody about the deal, it was off.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:19.680]   So if news got out about that secret deal, it was off.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   But that was the actual deal.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   And Khrushchev complied with it, and then my uncle complied with it.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.840]   - How much of that part of human history turned on the decisions of one person?
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:35.840]   - I think that's one of the, you know, 'cause that, of course, the perennial question, right?
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:43.440]   But it is history kind of on an automatic pilot, and, you know, human decisions,
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:50.720]   decisions of leaders really only have, you know, a marginal or incremental bearing on what
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.760]   is gonna happen anyway.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.920]   But I think that is the, and historians argue about that all the time.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:04.720]   I think that that is a really good example of a place in human history that literally
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.480]   the world could have ended if we had a different leader in the White House.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:15.520]   And the reason for that is that there were, as I recall, 64 gun emplacements, you know,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.920]   missile emplacements.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:24.880]   Each one of those missile emplacements had a crew of about 100 men, and they were Soviets.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:34.320]   So they were, and they, we didn't know whether, we had a couple of questions that my uncle
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:42.640]   asked, or asked the CIA, and he asked, Dulles was already gone, but he asked the CIA, and he asked
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.320]   his military brass, 'cause they all wanted to go in.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.960]   Everybody wanted to go in, and my uncle said, my uncle asked to see the aerial photos,
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.520]   and he examined those personally.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.680]   And that's why it's important to have a leader in the White House who can push back on their
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.560]   bureaucracies.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:07.120]   And then he asked them, you know, are those, who's manning those missile sites?
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.360]   And are they Russians?
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.600]   And if they're Russians and we bomb them,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:18.640]   are they, isn't it gonna force Khrushchev to then go into Berlin?
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:25.520]   And that would be the beginning of a cascade of facts that would, you know, highly likely
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.120]   end in nuclear confrontation.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:34.240]   And the military brass said to my uncle, oh, we don't think he'll have the, you know, we
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.200]   don't think he'll have the guts to do that.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.840]   So he was, my uncle was like, that's what you're betting on?
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.520]   And, you know, they all wanted him to go in.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.320]   They wanted him to bomb the sites and then invade Cuba.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.920]   And he said, if we bomb those sites, we're gonna be killing Russians, and it's gonna
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.440]   force, it's gonna provoke Russia into some response.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.080]   And the obvious response is for them to go into Berlin.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   Oh, but the thing that we didn't know then, and we didn't find out until I think, you
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.280]   know, there was a, it was like a 30-year anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Havana.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:22.400]   And what we learned then was that from the Russians who came to that event, it was like
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.760]   a symposium where everybody on both sides talked about it.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.040]   And we learned a lot of stuff that nobody knew before.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:35.520]   One of the insane things, the most insane thing that we learned was that the weapons
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.120]   were already, the nuclear warheads were already in place.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.320]   They were ready to fire.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:51.680]   And that the authorization to fire was made, was delegated to each of the gun crew commanders.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:58.080]   So there were 60 people who had all had authorization to fire if they felt themselves under attack.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:03.440]   So you have to believe that at least one of them would have launched, and that would
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   have been the beginning of the end.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.080]   And, you know, if anybody had launched, you know, we knew what would happen.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:15.440]   My uncle knew what would happen, because he asked again and again, what's gonna happen?
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:23.600]   And they said, 30 million Americans will be killed, but we will kill 130 million Russians,
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.480]   so we will win.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.440]   And that was a victory for them.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:34.160]   And my uncle said, later said, he told Arthur Schlesinger and Kenny O'Donnell, he said,
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.320]   "Those guys," he called them the salad brass, the guys with all of this stuff on their chest.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:46.160]   And he said, "Those guys, they don't care, because they know that if it happens, that
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.080]   they're gonna be in the charge of everything.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.960]   They're the ones who are gonna be running the world after that."
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.000]   So for them, you know, it was, there was an incentive to kill 130 million Russians and
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.400]   30 million Americans, but my uncle, he had this correspondence with Khrushchev.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.160]   They were secretly corresponding with each other.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.040]   And that is what saved the world, is that they had, that both of them had been men of war.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   You know, Eisenhower famously said, "It will not be a man of war, it will not be a soldier
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.320]   who starts World War III, because a guy who's actually seen it knows how bad it is."
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.840]   And my uncle, you know, had been in the heat of the South Pacific.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.080]   His boat had been cut in two by a Japanese destroyer.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:32.960]   His, many of his, three of his crewmen had been killed, one of them badly burned.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:38.800]   He pulled that guy with a lanyard in his teeth, six miles to an island in the middle of the
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:44.640]   night, and then they hid out there for 10 days, you know, and, and, you know, he came back,
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:48.880]   like I said, he was the only president of the United States that earned the Purple Heart.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:56.080]   Meanwhile, Khrushchev had been at Stalingrad, which was the worst place to be on the planet,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:01.280]   you know, probably in the 20th century, other than, you know, in Auschwitz or one of the death
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:08.880]   camps. It was, you know, it was, it was the most ferocious, horrific war with people starving,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.680]   people, you know, committed cannibalism, you know, eating the dogs, the cats, eating their
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:21.360]   shoe leather, freezing to death by the thousands, etc. Khrushchev did not want, the last thing he
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:26.400]   wanted was a war, and the last thing my uncle wanted was a war, and they, but the CIA did not
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:33.120]   know anything about Khrushchev, and the reason for that is the, there was a mole at Langley,
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:42.000]   so that every time the CIA got a spy in the Kremlin, he would immediately be killed.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.600]   So, they had no eyes in the Kremlin, you know, there were literally hundreds of Russian,
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.800]   of Russian spies who had, who were, who had defected to the United States and were in the
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:58.320]   Kremlin who were killed during that period. They had no idea anything about Khrushchev,
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.880]   about how he saw the world, and they saw the Kremlin itself as a monolith, you know, that it is
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:10.160]   kind of, you know, the same way that we look at Putin today, that, you know, it's all, they have
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.880]   this ambition of world conquest, and that's, it's driving them, and there's nothing else they think
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.720]   about, they're absolutely single-minded about it. But actually, there was a big division
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:28.720]   between Khrushchev and his Joint Chiefs, and his intelligence apparatus, and they both at one point
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.920]   discovered they were both in the same situation. They were surrounded by spies and military
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.800]   personnel who were intent on going to war, and they were the two guys resisting it. So, when my
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:46.160]   uncle, my uncle had this idea of, you know, being the peace president from the beginning, he told
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.640]   Ben Bradley, his, one of his best friends, who, you know, was the publisher of the Washington Post,
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:58.720]   or the editor-in-chief at that time, he said, Ben Bradley asked him, "What is, what do you want on
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:05.040]   your gravestone?" And my uncle said, "He kept the peace." He said, "The principal job of the
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:13.200]   president of the United States is to keep the country out of war." And so, when he first became
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:21.920]   president, he anxiously agreed to meet Khrushchev in Geneva to do his summit. And by the way,
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:27.600]   Eisenhower had wanted to do the same thing. Eisenhower wanted peace, but his, and he was
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:34.720]   going to meet in Vienna. But that peace summit was blown up. He was going to try to do, you know,
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:41.600]   he was going to try to end the Cold War. Eisenhower was in the last year of his, in May of 1960.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:49.920]   But that was torpedoed by the CIA during the U-2 crash. You know, they sent a U-2 over the,
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.160]   over the Soviet Union, it got shot down, and then they told, and then Alan Dulles
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:59.440]   told Eisenhower to deny that we had a program. They didn't know that the Russians had captured
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.520]   Gary Francis Powers. And so, when, and that blew up the peace talks between Eisenhower and Khrushchev.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:15.120]   And so, you know, and the, there was a lot of tension. My uncle wanted to break that tension.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:23.040]   He agreed to meet with Khrushchev in Vienna early on in his term. He went over there and
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:32.080]   Khrushchev snubbed him. Khrushchev lectured him imperiously about the, you know, the terror of
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:39.280]   American imperialism and rebuffed any, you know, they did agree not to go into Laos. They made an
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:46.080]   agreement that kept the United States, kept my uncle from sending troops to Laos. But it had
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.960]   been a disaster, Vienna. So then we had a spy that used to come to our house all the time,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:00.320]   a guy called Georgi Bolshevoy. He was this Russian spy my parents had met at the embassy.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.000]   They had gone to a party or a reception at the Russian embassy and he had approached them and
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.520]   they knew he was a, he was a GRU agent and KGB. He was both. Oh, he used to come to our house.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   They really liked him. He was very attractive. He was always laughing and joking. He would do rope
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.400]   climbing contests with my father. He would do pushup contests with my father. He was,
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.560]   he could do the Russian dancing, the Cossack dancing. And he would do that for us and teach
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.840]   us that. And we knew he was a spy too. And this was at the time of, you know, the James Bond films
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.720]   were first coming out. So it was really exciting for us to have an actual Russian spy in our house.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:48.160]   The state department was horrified by it. But anyway, when Khrushchev, after Vienna
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:58.720]   and after, you know, the bigs, Khrushchev had second thoughts. And he sent this long letter
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:07.040]   to my uncle and he didn't want to go through his state department or his embassy. He wanted to
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:15.040]   enron them. And he was friends with Bolshevik. So he gave Georgie the letter and Georgie brought
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.200]   it and handed it to Pierre Salinger, folded in the New York Times. And he gave it to my uncle.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.080]   And it was this beautiful letter, which he said, you know, my uncle had talked to him about the
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.640]   children who were played, you know, we played 29 grandchildren who were playing in his yard. And
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.160]   he's saying, what is our moral basis for making a decision that could kill these children so they'll
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:43.120]   never write a poem, they'll never participate in an election, they'll never run for office?
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.040]   How can we make, how can we morally make a decision that is going to eliminate
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.960]   life for these beautiful kids? And he had said that to Khrushchev. And Khrushchev wrote them
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:04.880]   this letter back saying that he was now sitting as this dacha on the Black Sea. And that he was
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:10.160]   thinking about what my uncle Jack had said to him at Vienna. And he regretted very deeply not having
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.320]   taken the olive leaf that Jack had offered him. And then he said, you know, it occurs to me now
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:23.040]   that we're all on an arc and that there is not another one. And that the entire fate of the
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:29.200]   planet and all of its creatures and all of the children are dependent on the decisions we make.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.920]   And you and I have a moral obligation to go forward with each other as friends. And immediately after
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:43.040]   that, this was, you know, he said that right after the Berlin crisis in 1962, General Curtis LeMay
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:52.480]   tried to, had tried to provoke a war with an incident at Checkpoint Charlie, which was
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:04:03.040]   the entrance and exit through the Berlin Wall in Berlin. And the Russian tanks had come to the
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.480]   wall, the US tanks had come to the wall, and there was a standoff. And my uncle had sent a message to
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.040]   Khrushchev then through Dobrynin saying, "My back is at the wall. I cannot, I have no place to back,
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.760]   to please back off. And then we will back off." And Khrushchev took his word,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:30.000]   backed his tanks off first. And then my uncle ordered LeMay to back, he had, LeMay had mounted
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.800]   bulldozer plows on the front of the tanks to plow down the Berlin Wall. And that, and the Russians
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.200]   had come, so it was just, you know, it was the, it was his generals trying to provoke a war.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:49.040]   And, but they started talking to each other then. And then when he, after he wrote that letter,
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.560]   they agreed that they would install a hotline so they could talk to each other and they wouldn't
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:02.320]   have to go through intermediaries. And so at Jack's house in the Cape, there was a red phone
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.920]   that we knew if we picked it up, Khrushchev would answer. And there was another one in the White
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:14.080]   House. And that, but they knew it was important to talk to each other, you know, and you just
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:21.040]   wish that we had that kind of leadership today. That can, you know, that just understands our job.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.440]   Look, I know you know a lot about AI, right? And you know how dangerous it is potentially
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:35.280]   to humanity and what opportunities it also, you know, offers. But it could kill us all. I mean,
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.800]   Elon said, first it's going to steal our job, then it's going to kill us, right?
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:45.360]   And it's probably not hyperbole. It actually, you know, if it follows the laws of biological
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.080]   evolution, which are just the laws of mathematics, that's probably a good end point for it,
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:59.360]   you know, a potential end point. So we need, it's going to happen, but we need to make sure
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:07.600]   it's regulated and it's regulated properly for safety in every country. And that includes Russia
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:14.080]   and China and Iran. Right now, we should be putting all the weapons of war aside and sitting
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.360]   down with those guys and say, how are we going to do this? There's much more important things to do
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.240]   we're going to, this stuff is going to kill us if we don't figure out how to regulate it.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:31.840]   And leadership needs to look down the road at what is the real risk here. And the real risk
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:40.960]   is that, you know, AI will, you know, enslave us for one thing and, you know, and then destroy us
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.680]   and do all this other stuff. And how about biological weapons? We're now all working on
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:53.920]   these biological weapons and we're doing biological weapons from Ebola and, you know, dengue fever and,
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.880]   you know, all of these other bad things. And we're making ethnic bioweapons,
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:05.680]   bioweapons that can only kill Russians, bioweapons that the Chinese are making that, you know,
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   can kill people who don't have Chinese genes. So all of this is now within reach, we're actively
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:20.800]   doing it and we need to stop it. And we can easily, a biological weapons treaty is the easiest thing
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.360]   in the world to do. We can verify it, we can enforce it and everybody wants to agree to it.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:33.040]   It's only insane people do not want to continue this kind of research. There's no reason to do it.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:39.440]   So there are these existential threats to all of humanity now out there, like AI and biological
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:47.360]   weapons. We need to stop fighting each other, start competing on economic game fields,
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.880]   playing fields instead of military playing fields, which will be good for all of humanity. And that
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:59.920]   we need to sit down with each other and negotiate reasonable treaties on how we regulate AI and
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.880]   biological weapons. And nobody's talking about this in this political race right now. Nobody's
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.240]   talking about it in a government. They get fixated on these little wars and, you know,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.400]   and these comic book depictions of good versus evil and, you know, and we all go, you know,
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:22.800]   and go off and give them the weapons and enrich, you know, the military and
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.080]   complex, but we're on the road to perdition if we don't end this.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:35.040]   - And some of this requires to have this kind of phone that connects Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:40.800]   that cuts through all the bureaucracy to have this communication between heads of state and in the
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.360]   case of AI, perhaps heads of tech companies, where you can just pick up the phone and have a
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.880]   conversation. Because a lot of it, a lot of the existential threats of artificial intelligence,
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.600]   perhaps even bioweapons is unintentional. It's not even strategic intentional effects. So you have
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.920]   to be transparent and honest about, especially with AI, that people might not know what's the
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.920]   worst that's going to happen once you release it out into the wild. And you have to have an honest
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.720]   communication about how to do it so that companies are not terrified of regulation,
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:21.840]   overreach regulation, and then government is not terrified of tech companies, of manipulating them
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.720]   in some direct or indirect ways. So like there's a trust that builds versus a distrust.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:33.840]   So basically that old phone where Khrushchev can call John F. Kennedy is needed.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:42.240]   - Yeah, and you know, I don't think, listen, I don't understand AI, okay? I do know, I can see
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:50.000]   from all this technology how it's this kind of turnkey totalitarianism that once you put these
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:59.520]   systems in place, they can be misused to enslave people and they can be misused in wars and to
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:06.240]   subjugate, to kill, to do all of these bad things. And I don't think there's anybody on Capitol Hill
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.640]   who understands this. We need to bring in the tech community and say, tell us what these regulations
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:20.160]   need to look like, so that there can be freedom to innovate, so that we can milk AI for all of
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.360]   the good things, but not fall into these traps that are gonna, that are these existential threats
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:33.680]   to, that pose existential threats to humanity. - It seems like John F. Kennedy is a singular
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.760]   figure in that he was able to have the humility to reach out to Khrushchev and also the strength
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.880]   and integrity to resist the, what did you call them, the salad brass and institutions like the
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:55.760]   CIA. So that makes it particularly tragic that he was killed. To what degree was CIA involved
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:03.600]   or the various bureaucracy involved in his death? - The evidence that the CIA was involved in my
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:12.720]   uncle's murder and that they were subsequently involved in the coverup and continue to be
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.240]   involved in the coverup. I mean, there's still 5,000 documents that they won't release 60 years
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:28.960]   later, is I think so insurmountable and so mountainous and overwhelming that it's beyond
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:35.600]   any reasonable doubt, including dozens of confessions of people who were involved in the
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:48.400]   assassination, but every kind of document. And I mean, it came as a surprise recently to most
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:57.120]   Americans, I think, the release of these documents in which the press, the American media finally
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:07.200]   acknowledged that, yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset and he was recruited in 1957. He was a
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:15.120]   Marine working at the Atatuzi Air Force Base, which was the CIA Air Force Base with the U-2
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.320]   flights, which was a CIA program. And that he was recruited by James Jesus Angleton,
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:29.360]   who was the director of counterintelligence and then sent on a fake defection to Russia
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:37.680]   and then brought back to Dallas. And people didn't know that, even though it's been known
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.520]   for decades, it never percolated into the mainstream media because they have such an
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.240]   allergy to anything that challenges the Warren Report.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:13:04.080]   When Congress investigated my uncle's murder in the 1970s, the Church Committee did, and they did
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.440]   two and a half year investigation, and they had many, many more documents and much more testimony
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:16.160]   available to them than the Warren Commission had. And this was a decade after the Warren
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.920]   Commission, they came to the conclusion that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:27.280]   And there was a division where essentially one guy on that committee believed it was
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.320]   primarily the mafia. But Richard Schweitzer, the senator who was head of the committee,
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:39.520]   said straight out the CIA was involved in the murder of the President of the United States.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.800]   I've talked to most of the staff on that committee, and they said, "Yeah,
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.080]   and the CIA was stonewalling us the whole way through."
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:55.440]   And the actual people that the CIA appointed, George Johannides, who the CIA appointed as
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.320]   a liaison to the committee, they brought him out of retirement. He had been one of the masterminds
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:11.200]   of the assassination. I mean, it's impossible to even talk about a tiny fraction of the evidence
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:17.920]   here. What I suggest to people, there are hundreds of books written about this that assemble this
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:25.440]   evidence and mobilize the evidence. The best book to me for people to read is James Douglas's book,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:31.840]   which is called The Unspeakable. And Douglas does this extraordinary, he's an extraordinary scholar,
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:40.480]   and he does this amazing job of digesting and summarizing and mobilizing all of the
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.240]   probably a million documents and the evidence from all these confessions that have come out
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:54.960]   into a coherent story. And it's riveting to read, and I recommend people who do not take my word for
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.000]   it, and don't take anybody else's word for it. Go ahead and do the research yourself. And one way
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.200]   to do that is probably the most efficient way is to read Douglas's book, because he has all
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:14.320]   the references there. - So if it's true that CIA had a hand in this assassination, how is it possible
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.120]   for them to amass so much power? How is it possible for them to become corrupt? And is it
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   individuals, or is it the entire institution? - No, it's not the entire institution. My daughter-in-law,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:33.680]   who's helping to run my campaign, was a CIA, you know, in the clandestine services
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.280]   for all of her career. She was a spy in the weapons of mass destruction program in the
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.480]   Mideast and in China. And there's 22,000 people who work for the CIA. Probably 20,000 of those
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:52.640]   are patriotic Americans and really good public servants, and they're doing important work for
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:59.840]   our country. But the institution is corrupt, and because the higher ranks of the institution.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.080]   And in fact, Mike Pompeo said something like this to me the other day. He was the director of the
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.040]   CIA. He said, "When I was there, I did not do a good job of cleaning up that agency." And he said,
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:18.400]   "The entire upper bureaucracy of that agency are people who do not believe in the institutions of
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:25.520]   democracy." This is what he said to me. So I don't know if that's true, but I know that, you know,
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.640]   that's significant. He's a smart person, and he ran the agency, and he was the Secretary of State.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:38.400]   But it's no mystery how that happened. We know the history. The CIA was originally,
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.560]   first of all, there was great reluctance in 1947. We had, for the first time, we had a secret
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:51.760]   spy agency in this country during World War II called the OSS. That was disbanded after the war,
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:58.720]   because Congress said, "Having a secret spy agency is incompatible with a democracy."
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.600]   The secret spy agencies are things like the KGB, the Stasi in East Germany, the SAVAK in Iran,
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:12.080]   and PEEP in Chile, whatever, you know, all over the world. They all have to do with totalitarian
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:18.880]   governments. They're not something that you can have. It's antithetical to democracy to have that.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:31.920]   In 1947, we created it. Truman signed it in, but it was initially an espionage agency,
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.560]   which means information gathering, which is important. It's to gather and consolidate
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:44.160]   information from many, many different sources from all over the world and then put those in reports
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.880]   so the White House, the president, can make good decisions based upon
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:18:00.720]   valid information, evidence-based decision making. But Alan Dulles, who was essentially the first
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:08.400]   head of the agency, made a series of legislative machinations and political machinations that gave
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   additional powers to the agency and opened up what they called then the plans division,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.040]   which is the plans division is the dirty tricks, it's the black ops, fixing elections,
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:30.000]   murdering what they call executive action, which means killing foreign leaders and, you know,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.600]   making small wars and bribing and blackmailing people, stealing elections, that kind of thing.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.760]   The reason at that time, you know, we were in the middle of the Cold War,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.160]   and Truman and Eisenhower did not want to go to war, they didn't want to commit troops.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:55.920]   And it seemed to them that, you know, this was a way of kind of fighting the Cold War secretly
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:05.360]   without and doing it at minimal cost by changing events sort of invisibly.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:12.240]   And so it was seductive to them. But everybody, you know, Congress, when they first voted in place,
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.520]   Congress, both political parties said, if we create this thing, it could turn into a monster,
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.560]   and it could undermine our, you know, our values. And today, it's so powerful,
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.280]   and nobody knows what its budget is. Plus, it has its own investment fund,
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:33.600]   In-Q-Tel, which has invested, you know, made, I think, 2000 investments in Silicon Valley.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.080]   Oh, it has ownership of a lot of these tech companies, and, you know, and the, a lot of the
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.920]   CEOs of those tech companies have signed state secrecy agreements with the CIA, which if they
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   even reveal that they have signed that, they can go to jail for 20 years and have their assets
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.400]   removed, etc. The influence that the agency has, the capacity to influence events at every level
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:09.200]   in our country, is really frightening. And then for most of its, for most of its life, the CIA was
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:16.320]   banned from propagandizing Americans. But we learned that they were doing it anyway. So in 1973,
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.560]   during the Church Committee hearings, we learned that the CIA had a program called Operation
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.200]   Mockingbird, where they had at least 400 members, leading members of the United States Press Corps,
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:37.920]   and the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc., who were secretly working for the
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:49.600]   agency and steering news coverage to support CIA priorities. And they agreed at that time to disband
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:56.640]   Operation Mockingbird in '73. But there's, there's indications they didn't do that. And they still,
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:03.920]   the CIA today is the biggest funder of journalism around the world. The biggest funder is through
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:11.520]   USAID. The USA, the United States funds journalism in almost every country in the world. You know,
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:17.680]   it owns newspapers, it has journalists, hundreds of thousands of journalists on its payroll.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.160]   They're not supposed to be doing that in the United States. But, you know, in 2016,
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:31.520]   President Obama changed the law to make it legal now for the CIA to propagandize Americans. And I
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.840]   think, you know, we can't look at the Ukraine war and how that was, you know, has been, how the
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:45.600]   narrative has been formed in the, in the minds of Americans, and say that the CIA had nothing to do
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.560]   with that. What is the mechanism by which the CIA influences the narrative? Do you think it's
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.680]   indirectly? Through the press. Indirectly through the press or directly by funding the press?
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.080]   Directly through, I mean, there's certain press organs that have been linked, you know,
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:08.640]   to the agency that the people who run those organs, things like the Daily Beast, now Rolling Stone,
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:14.000]   you know, editor of Rolling Stone, Noah Schlachman, has deep relationships with the
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:22.480]   intelligence community, Salon, Daily Kos. But I wonder why they would do it. So from my perspective,
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:27.120]   it just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity where your opinion cannot be
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:34.000]   influenced or bought. I agree with you. But I actually think that the entire field of journalism
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:44.960]   has, you know, really ashamed itself in recent years because it's become, you know, the principal
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:51.840]   newspapers in this country and the television station, the legacy media have abandoned their
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:59.680]   traditional, their tradition of, you know, which was when I was a kid, listen, my house was filled
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.480]   with the greatest journalists alive at that time. People like Ben Bradley, like Anthony Lewis,
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:14.160]   Mary McClory, Pete Hamill, Jack Newfield, Jimmy Breslin, and many, many others. And after my
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:22.800]   father, after my father died, they started the RFK Journalism Awards to recognize integrity and
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:27.440]   courage, you know, journalistic integrity and courage. And for that generation of journalism,
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:36.880]   they thought, they believed that the function of a journalist was to maintain this posture of
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.840]   fear, skepticism toward any aggregation of power, including government authority.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:48.640]   That you always, that people in authority lie and that they always have to be questioned. And that
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.680]   their job was to speak truth to power and to be guardians of the First Amendment right to
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.720]   free expression. But if you look what happened during the pandemic,
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:05.840]   it was the inverse of that kind of journalism where the major press organs in this country
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:11.760]   were, instead of speaking truth to power, they were doing the opposite. They were broadcasting
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:18.400]   propaganda. They became propaganda organs for the government agencies. And they were actually
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:26.720]   censoring the speech of anybody who dissents of the powerless. And in fact, it was an organized
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.120]   conspiracy. And it was the name of, it was the Trusted News Initiative. And some of the major
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:40.640]   press organs in our country signed onto it and they agreed not to print stories or facts that
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.840]   departed from government orthodoxy. So the Washington Post was the signature, the UPI,
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:54.320]   the AP, and then the four media or the four social media groups, Microsoft, Twitter,
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:01.680]   Facebook, and Google all signed onto the Trusted News Initiative. It was started by the BBC,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.760]   organized by them. And the purpose of it was to make sure nobody could print anything about
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.520]   government that departed from government orthodoxy. The way it worked is the UPI and the AP,
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.880]   which are the news services that provide most of the news around the country,
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.600]   and the Washington Post would decide what news was permissible to print.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:31.120]   And a lot of it was about COVID, but also on Biden's laptops, where it was impermissible
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.640]   to suggest that those were real or that they had stuff on there that was compromising.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:47.360]   And by the way, what I'm telling you now is all well documented and I'm litigating on it right
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.200]   now. So I'm part of a lawsuit against the DNI. And so I know a lot about what happened and I
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.680]   have all this documented and people can go to our website. There's a letter on my sub stack now to
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.200]   Michael Scherer of the Washington Post that outlines all this and gives all my sources.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.080]   Because Michael Scherer accused me of being a conspiracy theorist when he was actually part
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:19.920]   of a conspiracy, a true conspiracy, to suppress anybody who was departing from government
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.440]   orthodoxies by either censoring them completely or labeling them conspiracy theorists.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.320]   I mean, you can understand the intention and the action, the difference between this,
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.120]   we talked about. You can understand the intention of such a thing,
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:41.840]   being good, that in a time of a catastrophe, in a time of a pandemic, there's a lot of risk to saying
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:50.240]   untrue things. But that's a slippery slope that leads into a place where the journalistic
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.800]   integrity that we talked about is completely sacrificed. And then you can deviate from truth.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.400]   If you read their internal memorandum, including the statements of the leader of the
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:08.960]   Trusted News Initiative, I think her name's Jennifer Cecil. And you can go on our website
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:17.200]   and see her statement. She says, "The purpose of this is that we're now," she says, "When people
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.680]   look at us, they think we're competitors, but we're not. The real competitors are coming from
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:28.160]   all these alternative news sources now all over the network. And they're hurting public trust in
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.800]   us, and they're hurting our economic model. And they have to be choked off and crushed.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.840]   And the way that we're going to do that is to make an agreement with the social media sites that if
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:46.800]   we label their information misinformation, the social media sites will de-platform it,
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:53.920]   or they will throttle it, or they will shadow ban it, which destroys the economic model of those
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:00.320]   alternative competitive sources of information." So that's true. But the point you make is an
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:08.640]   important point, that the journalists themselves, who probably didn't know about the TNI agreement,
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.640]   certainly I'm sure they didn't, they believe that they're doing the right thing by suppressing
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:20.960]   information that may challenge government proclamations on COVID. But I mean, there's
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:28.080]   a danger to that. And the danger is that once you appoint yourself an arbiter of what's true
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:36.880]   and what's not true, then there's really no end to the power that you have now assumed for yourself.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:44.400]   Because now your job is no longer to inform the public. Your job now is to manipulate the public.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:52.560]   And if you end up manipulating the public in collusion with powerful entities, then you become
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:01.920]   the instrument of authoritarian rule rather than the opponent of it. And it becomes the inverse of
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:09.600]   journalism in a democracy. You're running for president as a Democrat. What to you are the
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.920]   strongest values that represent the left-wing politics of this country?
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:23.840]   I would say protection of the environment and the commons, the air, the water, wildlife,
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.760]   fisheries, public lands, those assets that cannot be reduced to private property ownership,
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:37.040]   the landscapes, our Purple Mountain majesty, the protection of the most vulnerable people
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:47.520]   in our society, people who, which would include children and minorities, the restoration of the
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:30:01.840]   middle class, and protection of labor, dignity, and decent pay for labor, bodily autonomy,
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:10.000]   a woman's right to choose, or an individual's right to endure unwanted medical procedures,
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.560]   peace. You know, the Democrats have always been anti-war. The refusal to use fear as a governing
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:26.400]   tool. FDR said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself because he recognized that
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:31.680]   tyrants and dictators could use fear to disable critical thinking and
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:47.440]   overwhelm the desire for personal liberty. The freedom of government from untoward influence
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:55.920]   by corrupt corporate power. The end of this corrupt merger of state and corporate power that
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:03.680]   is now, I think, dominating our democracy. What Eisenhower warned about when he warned
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:09.200]   against the emergence of the military-industrial complex. And then I prefer to talk about kind of
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:16.400]   the positive vision of what we should be doing in our country and globally, which is, you know,
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:22.880]   I see that the corporations are commoditizing us, are poisoning our children, are
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:33.600]   strip mining the wealth from our middle class, and treating America as if it were a business
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:40.640]   in liquidation, converting assets to cash as quickly as possible, and creating or exacerbating
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:47.840]   this huge disparity in wealth in our country, which is eliminating the middle class
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:53.360]   and creating, you know, kind of a Latin American-style feudal model. There's
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:59.440]   these huge aggregations of wealth above and widespread poverty below,
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:05.920]   and that's a configuration that is too unstable to support democracy sustainably,
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.280]   you know, and we're supposed to be modeling democracy, but we're losing it.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:17.520]   And, you know, I think we ought to have a foreign policy that restores our moral authority around
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:25.760]   the world, restores America as the embodiment of moral authority, which it was when my uncle was
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:34.720]   president, and as a purveyor of peace rather than, you know, a war-like nation. My uncle said he
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:41.200]   didn't want people in Africa and Latin America and Asia to think of, when they think of America,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.640]   to picture a man with a gun and a bayonet. He wanted them to think of a Peace Corps volunteer,
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.040]   and he refused to send combat veterans abroad, combat soldiers abroad. He never
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:33:03.840]   sent a single soldier to his death abroad, and, you know, into combat. He sent 16,000. He resisted
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:15.040]   in Berlin in '62. He resisted in Laos in '61. He resisted in Vietnam. You know, in Vietnam,
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:21.680]   they wanted him to put 250,000 troops. He only put 16,000 advisors, which was fewer troops,
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:29.200]   and he sent to get James Meredith into the universe, to Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi,
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   one Black man. He sent 16,000, and a month before he died, he ordered them all home. He actually,
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:46.480]   I think it was October 2nd of 1963, he heard that a Green Beret had died, and he asked his aide for a
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:52.560]   combat, for a list of combat fatalities, and the aide came back, and there were 75 men had died
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.520]   in Vietnam at that point, and he said, "That's too many. We're going to have no more." And he
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:05.040]   ordered, he signed a national security order, 263, and ordered all of those men, all Americans,
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:12.000]   home from Vietnam by 1965, with the first thousand coming home by December '63.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.560]   And then in November, he, of course, just before that evacuation began, he was killed. And a week
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.640]   later, President Johnson remanded that order, and then a year after that, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.920]   we sent 250,000, which is what they wanted my uncle to do, which he refused,
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:38.400]   and then, and it became an American war. And then Nixon, you know, topped it off at 560,000.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.280]   56,000 Americans never came home, including my cousin, George Skakel, who died at the Tet Offensive,
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.640]   and we killed a million Vietnamese, and we got nothing for it.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.160]   So America should be the symbol of peace.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:01.520]   And, you know, today, my uncle, you know, really focused on putting America on the side of the poor
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:10.640]   instead of our tradition of, you know, of fortifying oligarchies that were anti-communism.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:14.960]   That was our, you know, our major criteria. If you said you were against communists, and of course
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.760]   the people were, were the rich people. Our aid was going to the rich people in those countries,
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.560]   and they were going to the military juntas, our weapons were going to the juntas to fight against
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.120]   the poor. And my uncle said, no, you know, America should be on the side of the poor. And so he
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:38.080]   launched the Alliance for Progress and USAID, which were intended to bring aid to the poorest
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:45.200]   people in those and build middle classes and, and take ourselves away. In fact, his most,
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.840]   his favorite trip, his two favorite trips while he was president, his most favorite trip was to
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:36:00.960]   Ireland. Just incredible emotional homecoming for all of the people of Ireland. But his second
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.840]   favorite trip was when he went to Colombia. He went to Latin America, but Colombia was his favorite
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.880]   country. And I think there were 2 million people came into Bogota to see him, this vast crowd,
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:19.040]   and they were just delirious cheering for him. And the president of Colombia, Jerez Carmargo,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.480]   said to him, do you know why they love you? And my uncle said, why? And he said,
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.520]   because they think you've put America on the side of the poor against the oligarchs.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:39.760]   And, you know, when my uncle, after he died, today, there are more avenues and boulevards
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.480]   and hospitals and schools named and statues named after and commemorating in parks,
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:53.200]   commemorating John Kennedy in Africa and Latin America than any other president in the United
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.840]   States, and probably more than all the other presidents combined. And it's because, you know,
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.720]   he put America on the side of the poor, and that's what we ought to be doing. We ought to be projecting
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:10.880]   economic power abroad. The Chinese have essentially stolen his playbook. And, you know,
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.520]   we've spent $8 trillion on the Iraq war and its aftermath, the wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya,
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.840]   you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan. And what do we get for that? We got nothing for that money,
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:33.760]   $8 trillion. We got, we killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein. Iraq today is a much worse off
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:40.000]   than it was when Saddam was there. It's an incoherent, violent war between Shia and Sunni
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.640]   death squads. We pushed Iraq into the embrace of Iran, which has now become essentially a proxy
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.280]   for Iran, which is exactly the outcome that we were trying to prevent for the past, you know,
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:38:03.360]   20 or 30 years. We created ISIS. We sent 2 million refugees into Europe, destabilizing all of the
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:10.240]   nations in Europe for generations. And we're now seeing these riots in France, and that's a direct
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:18.960]   result from the Syrian war that we created and our creation of ISIS. Brexit is another, you know,
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:27.040]   result of that. So we, for $8 trillion, we wrecked the world. And during that same period that we
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:35.760]   spent $8.1 trillion bombing bridges, ports, schools, hospitals, the Chinese spent $8.1 trillion
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:44.720]   building schools, ports, hospitals, bridges, and universities. And now, you know, the Chinese are
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.160]   out-competing us everywhere in the world. Everybody wants to deal with the Chinese because they,
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.320]   you know, they come in, they build nice things for you, and there's no strings attached,
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.480]   and they're pleasant to deal with. And, you know, as a result of that, Brazil is switching
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:09.200]   the Chinese currency. Argentina is switching. Saudi Arabia, our greatest partner, you know,
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.960]   we put trillions of dollars into protecting our oil pipelines there, and now they're saying,
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:21.040]   you know, we don't care what the United States thinks. That's what Amin bin Salim said.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:31.520]   He said, we don't, you know, he dropped oil production in Saudi Arabia in the middle of a U.S.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:38.800]   inflation spiral. They've never done that to us before, to aggravate the inflation spiral.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:45.040]   And two weeks later, and then they signed a deal, a unilateral peace deal with Iran,
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.880]   which has been the enemy that we've been telling them to, you know,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.640]   be a bulwark against for 20 years. And two weeks after that, he said, we don't care what the United
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.280]   States thinks anymore. So that's what we got for spending all those trillions of dollars there. We
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   got short-term friends. And the United States, you know, policy abroad, and we have not made
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.960]   ourselves safer. We've made Americans, we've put Americans in more jeopardy all over the world.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:17.040]   You know, you have to wait in lines to get through the airport. You have to, you know,
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:25.280]   the security state is now costing us $1.3 trillion. And America is unsafer and poorer
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.560]   than it's ever been. So, you know, we're not getting, we should be doing what President
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:37.520]   Kennedy said we ought to do and what China, the policy that China has now adopted.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:43.520]   So that's a really eloquent and clear and powerful description of the way you see U.S.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:48.080]   should be doing geopolitics and the way you see U.S. should be taking care of the poor in this
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:55.760]   country. Let me ask you a question from Jordan Peterson that he asked when I told him that I'm
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:04.560]   speaking with you. Given everything you've said, when does the left go too far? I suppose he's
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:13.280]   referring to cultural issues, identity politics. Well, you know, Jordan trying
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.080]   to get me to bad mouth the left the whole time I was in. I really enjoyed my talk with him.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.840]   But he seemed to have that agenda where he wanted me to, you know, say bad things about the left.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.200]   And I just don't, you know, that's not what my campaign is about. I want to do the opposite.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:37.920]   Oh, I'm not going to bad mouth the left. They try, you know, I was on a show this week with
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:44.240]   David Remnick from The New Yorker, and he tried to get me to bad mouth Donald Trump and, you know,
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.840]   and Alex Jones and a lot of other people just and baiting me to do it. And of course,
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.000]   there's a lot of bad things I could say about all those people, but it doesn't, you know,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.280]   I'm trying to find, I'm trying to find values that hold us together, that we can share in common
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:08.160]   rather than to focus constantly on these disputes and these issues that drive us apart. So me
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:14.240]   sitting here bad mouthing the left or bad mouthing the right is not going to advance the ball. I
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:20.400]   really want to figure out ways that, you know, what do these groups hold in common that we can all,
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.040]   you know, have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:30.560]   Well, that's music to my ears. But in that spirit, let me ask you a difficult question then.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.600]   You wrote a book harshly criticizing Anthony Fauci. Let me ask you to steel man the case for
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.960]   the people who support him. What is the biggest positive thing you think Anthony Fauci did
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:48.160]   for the world? What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.840]   You know, I don't want to sit here and speak on Charlie by saying the guy
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:43:01.360]   didn't do anything, but I, I don't, I can't think of anything. I mean, if you,
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.560]   if you tell me something that you think he did, you know, maybe there was a drug that got licensed
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.360]   while he was at NIH that, you know, benefited people. That's certainly possible. He was there
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:22.640]   for 50 years. And I, I, in terms of his, um, of his principal programs of the AIDS programs and
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:28.560]   his COVID programs. And I think that the harm that he did vastly outweigh the, you know, the,
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.880]   the benefits. Do you think he believes he's doing good for the world? I don't know what he believes
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:41.120]   in fact, in that book, which is I think 250,000 words, I never tried to look inside of his head.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:46.560]   I did. I deal with facts. I deal with science. So, and I have every, every factual assertion
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:52.160]   in that book is cited in sores to government databases or peer reviewed publications.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:58.320]   And I don't, I try not to speculate about things that I don't know about, or I can't prove. And I
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:05.920]   do, I cannot tell you what his motivations were. I mean, all of us, he's done a thing, a lot of
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:13.440]   things that I think are really very, very bad things for humanity, very deceptive. But we all
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.720]   have this, this capacity for self-deception. As I said at the beginning of this podcast, we,
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.480]   we judge ourselves on our intentions rather than our actions. And we all
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:30.880]   have an almost infinite capacity to convince ourselves that what we're doing is, is right.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:38.800]   And you know, not everybody kind of lives an examined life and is examining their motivations
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.680]   and the way that the world might experience their professions of goodness.
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.520]   Let me ask about the difficulty of the job he had. Do you think it's possible to do that kind
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:56.000]   of job well, or is it also a fundamental flaw of the job of being the central centralized figure
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.240]   that's supposed to have scientific policy? No, I think he was a genuinely bad human being
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:08.160]   and that there were many, many good people in that department over the years.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:16.640]   Bernice Eddy is a really good example. John Anthony Morris, many people whose careers he
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:22.560]   destroyed because they were trying to tell the truth. One after the other, the greatest scientists
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:29.360]   in the history of NIH were run out of that organization, out of that agency. But you know,
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:37.360]   people listening to this, you know, probably, you know, will, in hearing me say that, will think
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:44.240]   that I'm bitter or that I, I'm doctrinaire about him. But you know, you should really go and read
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.920]   my book. And I, it's hard to summarize a, you know, I tried to be really methodical
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:58.560]   to not call names, to just say what happened. You are, the bigger picture of this is you're
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:05.040]   an outspoken critic of pharmaceutical companies, Big Pharma. What is the biggest problem with Big
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:10.960]   Pharma and how can it be fixed? Well, the problem could be fixed through regulation, you know,
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:23.440]   the problems, but the pharmaceutical industry is, is, I mean, I don't want to say because this is
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.600]   going to seem extreme that a criminal enterprise, but if you look at the history, that is an
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:36.880]   applicable descriptor or characterization. For example, the four biggest vaccine makers,
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.240]   Sanofi, Merck, Pfizer, and Glaxo, four companies that make all of the 72 vaccines that are now
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.960]   mandated for America, effectively mandated for American children. Collectively, those companies
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:47:01.120]   have paid $35 billion in criminal penalties and damages in the last decade. And I think
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:07.520]   since 2000, about 79 billion. So, these are the most corrupt companies in the world.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:15.280]   And the problem is that they're serial felons. They, you know, they do this again and again
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:23.360]   and again. So, they did, you know, Merck did Vioxx, which, Vioxx, they, you know, they killed
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.040]   people by falsifying science. And they did it, they lied to the public. They said, this is a
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:36.000]   headache medicine and an arthritis painkiller. But they didn't tell people that it also gave
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.960]   you heart attacks. And they knew, you know, we've found when we sued them, you know, the memos from
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.600]   their bean counters saying, we're going to kill this many people, but we're still going to make
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.880]   money. So, they make those calculations and those calculations are made very, very regularly.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.680]   And then, you know, when they get caught, they pay a penalty. And I think they paid about $7
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:08.560]   billion for Vioxx. But then they went right back that same year that they paid that penalty,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.680]   they went back into the same thing again with Gardasil and with a whole lot of other
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:20.240]   drugs. So, the way that the system is set up, the way that it's sold to doctors, the way that
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:29.120]   nobody ever goes to jail. So, there's really no penalty that it all becomes part of the cost of
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.200]   doing business. And, you know, you can see other businesses that if they're not, if they don't,
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.560]   if there's no penalty, if there's no real, I mean, look, these are the companies that gave us the
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.560]   opioid epidemic, right? So, they knew what was going to happen. And we, you know, you go and
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:53.040]   see there's a documentary, I forget what the name of it is, but it shows exactly what happened. And,
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:49:01.200]   you know, they corrupted FDA. They knew that oxycodone was addictive. They got FDA to tell
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:08.880]   doctors that it wasn't addictive. They pressured FDA to lie and they got their way. And they've,
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.800]   so far, they've had this year, you know, those, they got a whole generation addicted to oxycodone.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.600]   And now, you know, when they got caught and they made it, we made it harder to get oxycodone. And
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:27.840]   now all those addicted kids are going to fentanyl and dying. And this year it killed 106,000.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:35.200]   That's twice as many people who were killed during the 20-year Vietnam War, but in one year,
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:41.920]   twice as many American kids. And they knew it was going to happen. And they did it to make money.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:46.640]   So I don't know what you call that other than saying that's, you know, a criminal enterprise.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:52.480]   - Or is it possible to have, within a capitalist system, to produce medication,
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:55.600]   to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt?
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.440]   - Of course it is.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.160]   - How?
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:05.120]   - Through, you know, through a solid regulatory regimen, you know, where drugs are actually tested.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:12.560]   You know, I mean, the problem is not the capitalist system. The capitalist system, I, you know, I
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:17.040]   have great admiration for the thing that love for the capitalist system is the greatest economic
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:24.560]   engine ever devised. But it has to be harnessed to a social purpose. Otherwise it's going to,
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:32.560]   it leads us, you know, down the trail of oligarchy, environmental destruction, and, you know, and
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.200]   commoditizing, poisoning, and killing human beings. That's what it will do in the end.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:53.520]   You need a regulatory structure that is not corrupted by entanglements, financial entanglements
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:59.680]   with the industry. And we've set this up the way that this is, that the system is set up today
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:09.920]   has created this system of regulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget comes from
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.080]   pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, you know, their money is coming,
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.600]   their salaries are coming from pharma, half their salaries. So they're, you know, they know who their
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:27.280]   bosses are. And that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved as
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.640]   quickly as possible. It's called fast track approval. And they pay 50% of FDA's budget.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:37.840]   It goes about 45% actually goes to fast track approval.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.920]   Do you think money can buy integrity?
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:47.200]   Oh yeah, of course it can. Yeah, I mean, there's, that's not something that is controversial. Of
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.760]   course it will. So, and then-
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.880]   It's slightly controversial to me. I would like to think that scientists that work at FDA-
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.640]   Well, it may not be able to buy your integrity. I'm talking about population-wide. I'm not
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.160]   talking about the individual.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:05.760]   But I'd like to believe that scientists, I mean, in general, a career of a scientist is not a very
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.440]   high paying job. I'd like to believe that people that go into science that work at FDA, that work
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:17.200]   at NIH are doing it for a reason that's not even correlated with money really.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:22.720]   Yeah. And I think probably that's why they go in there, but scientists are corruptible. And,
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:30.400]   you know, the way that I can tell you that is that I've brought over 500 lawsuits and almost
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.600]   all of them involve scientific controversies. And there are scientists on both sides in every one.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:42.160]   When we sued Monsanto, there was on the Monsanto side, there was a Yale scientist,
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:46.480]   a Stanford scientist, and a Harvard scientist. And on our side, there was a Yale, Stanford,
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.320]   and Harvard scientist. And they were saying exactly the opposite things.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.000]   In fact, there's a word for those kind of scientists who take money for their opinion,
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.800]   and the word is by "ostitutes." And they are very, very common. And, you know, and I've been
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.640]   dealing with them my whole career. You know, I think it was Upton Sinclair who said that it's
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:16.000]   very difficult to persuade a man of a fact if the existence of that fact will diminish his salary.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:22.000]   And I think that's true for all of us. If they, you know, we find a way of reconciling ourselves
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:32.320]   to things that are, to truths that actually, and worldviews, that actually benefit our salaries.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:40.160]   Now, NIH, NIH has probably the worst system, which is that scientists who work for NIH,
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:46.320]   NIH itself, which used to be the premier gold standard scientific agency in the world,
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:54.240]   everybody looked at NIH, that today it's just an incubator for pharmaceutical drugs. And, you know,
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:02.560]   that is that gravity of economic self-interest. Because if you're, if NIH itself collects
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:07.520]   royalties, they have margin rights for the patents on all the drugs that they work on.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:12.480]   So, with the Moderna vaccine, which they promoted incessantly and aggressively,
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.760]   NIH owned 50% of that vaccine and is making billions and billions of dollars on it.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:23.280]   And there are four, at least four scientists that we know of, and probably at least six
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.600]   at NIH who themselves have margin rights for those patents. So, if you are a scientist who
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:35.360]   work at NIH, you work on a new drug, you then get margin rights and you're entitled to royalties
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:41.120]   of $150,000 a year forever from that, forever. Your children, your children's children, as long
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:47.440]   as that product's on the market, you can collect royalties. So, you have, you know, the Moderna
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:54.560]   vaccine is paying for the top people at NIH, you know, some of the top regulators, it's paying
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.880]   for their boats, it's paying for their mortgages, it's paying for their children's education.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:10.560]   And, you know, you have to expect that in those kinds of situations, the regulatory function would
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:19.360]   be subsumed beneath the mercantile ambitions of the agency itself and the individuals who stand
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.680]   to profit enormously from getting a drug to market. Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer,
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.800]   to find problems with those drugs before they get to market. But if you know that drug is going to
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:36.400]   pay for your mortgage, you may overlook a little problem, and that worry even a very big one,
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.480]   and that's the problem. - You've talked about that the media
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:46.800]   slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer, and you've said that you're not anti-vaccine,
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:53.840]   you're pro-safe vaccine. Difficult question. Can you name any vaccines that you think are good?
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:58.480]   - I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:07.680]   averting more problems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is, you know, safe and
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:10.400]   effective. - Those are big words.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.840]   - Those are big words. - What about the polio?
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.880]   Can we talk about the polio? - Here's the problem.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.200]   - Yes. - Yeah, here's the problem.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:26.640]   The polio vaccine contained a virus called simian virus 40, SV40. It's one of the most
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.160]   carcinogenic materials that is known to man. In fact, it's used now by scientists around
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:38.480]   the world to induce tumors in rats and guinea pigs in labs. But it was in that vaccine,
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.120]   98 million people who got that vaccine in my generation got it, and now you've had this
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.040]   explosion of soft tissue cancers in our generation that kill many, many, many, many, many more people
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:55.120]   than polio ever did. So if you say to me, did the polio vaccine, was it effective against polio?
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:02.000]   I'm gonna say yes. If you say to me, did it kill more people, did it cause more deaths than I've
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.240]   heard? I would say, I don't know, because we don't have the data on that. So--
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:11.440]   - But let's talk, well, you know, we kind of have to narrow in on, is it effective against the thing
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:14.640]   it's supposed to fight? - Oh, well, a lot of them are. And let me give you an example.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.240]   The most popular vaccine in the world is the DTP vaccine, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:28.000]   It was used in this, introduced in this country around 1980. That vaccine caused so many injuries
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.160]   that Wyatt, which was the manufacturer, was said to the Reagan administration, we are now paying
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:40.480]   $20 in downstream liabilities for every dollar that we're making in profits, and we are getting
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:46.960]   out of the business unless you give us permanent immunity from liability. So the vaccine companies
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:52.640]   then were given, and by the way, Reagan said at that time, why don't you just make the vaccine safe?
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:59.920]   And Wyatt said, because vaccines are inherently unsafe, they said unavoidably unsafe,
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:06.640]   you cannot make them safe. And so when Reagan wrote the bill and passed it, the bill says
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:12.560]   in its preambles, because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe. And the Brucewitz case, which was a
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.640]   Supreme Court case that upheld that bill, used that same language, vaccines cannot be made safe,
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.680]   they're unavoidably unsafe. So this is what the law says. Now, I just want to finish this story,
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:31.760]   because this illustrates very well your question. The DTP vaccine was discontinued in this country,
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:38.640]   and it was discontinued in Europe, because so many kids were being injured by it. However,
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:44.240]   the WHO and Bill Gates gives it to 161 million African children every year.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:53.280]   And Bill Gates went to the Danish government and asked them to support this program, saying we've
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:59.920]   saved 30 million kids from dying from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The Danish government
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:06.240]   said, can you show us the data? And he couldn't. So the Danish government paid for a big study
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:13.760]   with Novo Nordisk, which is a Scandinavian vaccine company in West Africa. And they went to West
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:20.640]   Africa, and they looked at the DTP vaccine for 30 years of data. And they hired, they retained the
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:25.920]   best vaccine scientists in the world, these kind of deities of African vaccine program, Peter AAB,
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:32.160]   Sigrid Morgensen, and a bunch of others. And they looked at 30 years of data for the DTP vaccine,
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:37.760]   and they came back, and they were shocked by what they found. They found that the vaccine was
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:43.120]   preventing kids from getting diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. But the girls who got that vaccine
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:50.160]   were 10 times more likely to die over the next six months than children who didn't. Why is that?
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:54.800]   And they weren't dying from anything, anybody ever associated with the vaccine. They were dying of
[01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:02.720]   anemia, heart disease, malaria, sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease, pneumonia.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:13.280]   And it turns out this is what the researchers found, who were all pro-vaccine, by the way,
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:20.640]   they said that this vaccine is killing more children than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.800]   prior to the introduction of the vaccine. And for 30 years, nobody ever noticed it.
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.920]   The vaccine was providing protection against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:34.880]   children's immune systems, and they could not defend themselves against random infections that
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:38.560]   were harmless to most children. - But isn't that nearly impossible to
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.560]   prove that link? - You can't prove the link. All you can do is,
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:48.400]   for any particular interest, you can't. Illness or death, you can't prove the link. But you can
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:54.960]   show statistically that if you get that vaccine, you're more likely to die over the next six months
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.520]   than if you don't. And those studies, unfortunately, are not done for any other vaccines.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:05.760]   So for every other medicine, in order to get approval from the FDA, you have to do a placebo
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:13.680]   control trial prior to licensure, where you look at health outcomes among an exposed group,
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:20.160]   a group that gets it, and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets a placebo.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:29.120]   The only medical intervention that does not undergo placebo control trials prior to licensure
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:35.360]   are vaccines. Not one of the 72 vaccines that are now mandated for our children have ever undergone
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:41.280]   a placebo control trial prior to licensure. - So I should say that there's a bunch, on that point,
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.000]   I've heard from a bunch of folks that disagree with you, including polio. I mean,
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.160]   testing is a really important point. Before licensure, placebo control, randomized trials,
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:02:00.080]   polio received just that against the saline placebo control.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:07.120]   So it seems unclear to me, I'm confused why you say that they don't go through that process. It
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:15.840]   seems like a lot of them do. - Here's the thing, is that I was saying that for many years, 'cause
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:24.160]   we couldn't find any. And then in 2016, in March, I met, President Trump ordered Dr. Fauci to meet
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:33.280]   with me, and Dr. Fauci and Francis Collins, and I said to them during that meeting, "You have been
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:39.520]   saying that I'm not telling the truth when I said not one of these has undergone a prior, pre-licensure
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:45.120]   placebo control. And the polio may have had one post-licensure, most of them haven't.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:53.120]   The polio may have, I don't know. But I said, our question was, prior to licensure, do you ever
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:03:04.400]   test these for safety? And by the way, I think the polio vaccine did undergo a saline placebo
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:14.000]   trial prior to licensure, but not for safety, only for efficacy. So I'm talking about safety trials.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:22.800]   Now, Fauci told me that he said, "I can't find one now." He had a whole tray of files there.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.480]   He said, "I can't find one now, but I'll send you one." I said, "Just for any vaccines, send me one,
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:36.960]   for any of the 72 vaccines." He never did. So we sued the HHS. And after a year of stonewalling us,
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:44.320]   HHS came back and they gave us a letter saying we have no pre-licensing safety trial for any of the
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:52.080]   72 vaccines. And that letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit against them, because we
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:58.480]   had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is posted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it.
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:06.960]   So if HHS had any study, I assume they would have given it to us and they can't find one.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:12.480]   Well, let me zoom out because a lot of the details matter here. Pre-licensure,
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:20.800]   what does placebo-controlled mean? So this probably requires a rigorous analysis. And
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.160]   actually at this point, it would be nice for me just to give the shout out to other people,
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:32.160]   much smarter than me, that people should follow along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:38.720]   Use their mind, learn, and think. So one really awesome creator, I really recommend him,
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:45.680]   is Dr. Dan Wilson. He hosts the Debunk the Funk podcast. Vincent Recaniello, who hosts This Week
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.160]   in Virology, brilliant guy, I've had him on the podcast. Somebody you've been battling with
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:56.480]   is Paul Offit. Interesting Twitter, interesting books, people should read and understand and read
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:02.080]   your books as well. And Eric Topol has a good Twitter and good books, and even Peter Hotez,
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:06.720]   I'll ask you about him. And people should, because Paul Offit
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:20.560]   published a sub-stack recently debunking, I think, my discussion with Joe Rogan.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:30.000]   And we have published a debunk of his debunking. So if you read his stuff, you should read both.
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:30.960]   Read both, yes.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.160]   You should read. And I would love to debate any of these guys.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:43.280]   So Joe Rogan proposed just such a debate, which is quite fascinating to see how much attention
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:49.280]   and how much funding it garnered, the debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do you think
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:50.560]   Peter rejected the offer?
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:55.360]   I think it's, you know, again, I'm not going to look into his head,
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:02.880]   but what I will say is if you're a scientist and you're making public recommendations based upon
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:08.640]   what you say is evidence-based science, you ought to be able to defend that. You ought to be able
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:13.280]   to defend it in a public forum, and you ought to be able to defend it against all commerce.
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:21.040]   And, you know, so I, you know, if you're a scientist, science is based on,
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:27.520]   is rooted in logic and reason. And if you can't use logic and reason to defend your position,
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:35.280]   and by the way, I know almost all of the studies. I've written books on them, and
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.600]   we've made a big effort to assemble all the studies on both sides.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:45.200]   And so I'm prepared to talk about those studies, and I'm prepared to submit them in advance,
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:52.000]   you know, and for each of the points. And by the way, I've done that with Peter Hotez.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.600]   You know, I've actually, because I had this kind of informal debate with him,
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:07.040]   several years ago with a referee at that time, and we were debating not only by phone, but by email.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:11.920]   And on those emails, every point that he would make, I would cite science, and he could never
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:17.840]   come back with science. He could never come back with publications. He would give publications
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:22.880]   that had nothing to do with, for example, thimerosal vaccines, mercury-based vaccines.
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:30.320]   He sent me one time 16 studies to rebut something I'd said about thimerosal, and not one of those
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:35.440]   studies, they were all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain thimerosal. So it wasn't
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:42.880]   like a real debate where you're, you know, you're using reason and isolating points and having a,
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:49.360]   you know, a rational discourse. I don't think that he, I don't blame him for not debating me,
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:57.520]   because I don't think he has the science. - Are there aspects of all the work you've
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:03.280]   done on vaccines, all the advocacy you've done, that you found out that you were not correct on,
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:07.200]   that you were wrong on, that you've changed your mind on?
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:14.560]   - Yeah, there are many times over time that I, you know, I found that I've made mistakes,
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:21.040]   and we correct those mistakes. You know, I run a big organization, and I do a lot of tweets. You
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:27.520]   know, I'm very careful. For example, my Instagram, I was taken down for misinformation, but there was
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:32.400]   no misinformation on my Instagram. Everything that I cited on Instagram was cited or sourced
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:38.000]   to a government database or to peer-reviewed science. But for example, The Defender, which was
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:46.320]   our organization's newsletter, we summarize scientific reports all the time. That's one
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:51.760]   of the things, the services that we provide. We watch the, you know, PubMed, and we watch the
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.440]   peer-reviewed publications, and we summarize them when they come out. We have made mistakes. When we
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:03.360]   make a mistake, we are rigorous about acknowledging it, apologizing for it, and changing it. That's
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:08.320]   what we do. I think we have one of the most robust fact-checking operations anywhere in journalism
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:15.680]   today. We actually do real science, and you know, there—listen, I've put up on my Twitter account,
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.880]   and there are numerous times that I've made mistakes on Twitter, and I apologize for it.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:27.680]   And people say to me, you know, "Oh, that's weird. I've never seen anybody apologize on Twitter."
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:34.560]   And I think it's really important, of course, human beings make mistakes. My book is, you know,
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:40.960]   230,000, or 40,000, or 50,000 words. There's going to be a mistake in there. But you know,
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.920]   what I say at the beginning of the book, if you see a mistake in here, please notify me. I give
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:51.440]   a way that people can notify me. And if somebody points out a mistake, I'm going to change it. I'm
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:56.240]   not going to dig my feet in and say, you know, I'm not going to acknowledge this.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:02.480]   So some of the things we've been talking about, you've been an outspoken contrarian on some
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:09.680]   very controversial topics. This has garnered some fame and recognition,
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:15.680]   in part for being attacked and standing strong against those attacks. If I may say,
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:22.000]   for being a martyr, do you worry about this drug of martyrdom that might cloud your judgment?
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.040]   First of all, yeah, I don't consider myself a martyr, and I've never considered myself a
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:32.560]   victim. I make choices about my life, and I, you know, and I'm content with those choices and
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:38.640]   peaceful with them. I'm not trying to be a martyr or a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:48.720]   is right, because I want to be peaceful inside of myself. But the only guard I have is, you know,
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:57.520]   fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong, for example,
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:05.680]   if you come back and say, look, Bobby, here's a polio, here's a safety study on polio that was
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:10.800]   done pre-licensure and used a real salient solution, I'm going to put that on my Twitter,
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:16.800]   and I'm going to say I was wrong. There is one out there. So, you know, but that's all I can do.
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.600]   All right, I have to ask, you are in great shape. Can you go through your diet and exercise routine?
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:34.560]   I do intermittent fasting. So, I eat between, I start at my first meal at around noon,
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:45.600]   and then I try to stop eating at six or seven. And then I hike every day.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.440]   Morning, evening?
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.200]   In the morning. I go to a meeting first thing in the morning, 12-7 meeting, and I go hike,
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.480]   and I hike uphill for a mile and a half up and a mile and a half down with my dogs,
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.800]   and I do my meditations. And then I go to the gym, and I go to the gym for 35 minutes.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:13.520]   I don't, I do it short time. I've been exercising for 50 years, and what I found is it's sustainable
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.880]   if I do just the short periods. And I do four different routines at the gym,
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:26.960]   and I never relax at the gym. I go in there, and I have a very intense exercise. I could tell you
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:36.000]   what my routine is, but I do backs one day, chest one day, legs, and then a miscellaneous. And I do
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:44.560]   12. My first set of everything is I try to reach failure at 12 reps, and then my fourth set of
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:53.600]   everything is a strip set. I do, I take a lot of vitamins. I can't even list them to you here,
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.920]   because I, you know, I couldn't even remember them all, but I take a ton of vitamins and nutrients.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:11.120]   I'm on an anti-aging protocol from my doctor that includes testosterone replacement,
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:19.120]   but I don't take any steroids. I don't take any anabolic steroids or anything like that. And the
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.960]   DRT I use is bio-identical to what my body produced.
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:27.840]   - What are your thoughts on hormone therapy in general?
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.600]   - I talk to a lot of doctors about that stuff, you know, because I'm interested in health.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.640]   And I, you know, I've heard really good things about it, but I don't know.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.720]   I'm definitely not an expert on it.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:47.840]   - "About God," you wrote, "God talks to human beings through many vectors, wise people,
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:53.040]   organized religion, the great books of religions, through art, music, and poetry,
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:58.400]   but nowhere with such detail and grace and joy as through creation. When we destroy nature,
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:02.800]   we diminish our capacity to sense the divine. What is your relationship,
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.680]   and what is your understanding of God? Who is God?"
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:15.520]   - Well, I mean, God is incomprehensible, you know? I mean, I guess most philosophers would say we're,
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:22.640]   you know, we're inside the mind of God, and so it would be impossible for us Sunders,
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:29.680]   and, you know, what actually what, you know, what God's form is. But I mean, for me, I have a,
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:41.120]   let's say this, I had, when I was, I was raised in a very, very deeply religious setting.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:48.080]   So we went to church in the summer, oftentimes twice a day,
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:56.400]   morning mass, and we went to, we definitely went every Sunday, and I went,
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:02.960]   we prayed in the morning, we prayed before and after every meal, we prayed at night, we said a
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:10.640]   rosary, sometimes three rosaries a night, and my father read us the Bible whenever he was home. He
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:16.000]   would read us, you know, we'd all get in the bed, and he'd read us the Bible stories. And I went to
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.280]   Catholic schools, I went to Jesuit schools, I went to the nuns, and I went to a Quaker school at one
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:28.240]   point. When I, I became a drug addict when I was about 15 years old, about a year after my dad
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.680]   died, and I was addicted to drugs for 14 years. During that time, when you're an addict, you're
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.120]   living against conscience, and when you're living, and I never, you know, I was always trying to get
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:48.240]   off of drugs, never able to, but I never felt good about what I was doing. And when you're living
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:55.920]   against conscience, you kind of push God to the peripheries of your life. So I'll call me He,
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:06.160]   gets, recedes and gets smaller. And then when I, when I got sober,
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:14.080]   I knew that I had a couple of experiences. One is that I had a friend of my brother's,
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:21.440]   one of my brothers who died of this disease of addiction, had a good friend who had used to
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:30.080]   take drugs with us, and he became a Mooney, so he became a follower of Reverend Sun, Sun Young Moon,
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:37.200]   and he, at that point, his compulsion, he had the same kind of compulsion that I had,
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:44.080]   and yet it was completely removed from him. And so, and he used to come and hang out with us,
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:49.920]   but he would not want to take drugs, even if I was taking them right in front of him. He was,
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:58.080]   he was immune to it. He'd become impervious to that impulse. And I, when I was in the,
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:05.440]   when I first got sober, I was, I knew that I did not want to be the kind of person who was,
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:11.040]   you know, waking up every day in white-knuckling sobriety and just, you know, trying to resist,
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:17.920]   resist through willpower. And by the way, I had, I had iron willpower as a kid. I gave up candy
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:24.240]   for Lent when I was 12, and I didn't eat it again until I was in college. I gave up, I gave up
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.880]   desserts the next year for Lent, and I didn't ever eat another dessert until I was in college,
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:35.840]   and I was trying to bulk up for rugby and for sports. So, I felt like I could do anything with
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:44.480]   my willpower, but somehow, this particular thing, you know, the addiction, was completely impervious
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:50.960]   to it. And it was cunning, baffling, incomprehensible. I could not understand why I
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:55.120]   couldn't just say no and then never do it again, like I did with everything else.
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:05.120]   And so, I was living against conscience, and I thought about this guy, and I, you know,
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:11.520]   reflecting my own prejudices at that time in my life, I said to myself, I didn't want to be,
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:17.680]   I didn't want to be like a drug addict who was wanting a drug all the time and just not being
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:26.880]   able to do it. I wanted to completely realign my, my, myself so that I was somebody who got
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:32.000]   up every day and just didn't want to take drugs, never thought of them, you know, kissed the wife
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:38.800]   and children and went to work and was never thought about drugs the whole day. And I knew that people
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:43.200]   throughout history had done that. You know, I'd read the lives of the Saints. I knew St. Augustine
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:50.160]   had met a very, very dissolute youth, and, you know, had this spiritual realignment transformation.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:54.320]   I knew the same thing had happened to St. Paul, you know, at Damascus. The same thing had happened
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.120]   to St. Francis. St. Francis also had a, had a dissolute and fun-loving youth and had, you know,
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:06.480]   had this deep spiritual realignment. And I knew that that had happened to people throughout history,
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:13.680]   and I thought that's what I needed, you know, something like that. I had the example of this
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:19.360]   friend of mine, and I used to think about him, and I would think, and this again reflects the
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.280]   bias and the, you know, probably the meanness of myself at that time, but I said I'd rather be dead
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:34.320]   than be a Mooney. But I wish I somehow could distill that power that he got without becoming
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:43.360]   a religious nuisance. And at that time, I picked up a book by Carl Jung called "Synchronicity."
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:48.640]   And Jung, he was a psychiatrist. He was a contemporary of Freud's. He was a,
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:55.120]   Freud was his mentor, and Freud wanted him to be his replacement, but Freud was an avowed atheist.
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:20:01.120]   And Jung was a deeply spiritual man. He had these very intense and genuine spiritual experiences
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.880]   from when he was a little boy, from when he was three years old, that he remembers. His biography
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:14.480]   is fascinating about him because he remembers them with such detail. And he had written,
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:19.200]   he was always, he was interesting to me because he was a very faithful scientist, and I considered
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:25.280]   myself a science-based person from when I was little. And yet, he had this spiritual dimension
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:30.720]   to him which infused all of his thinking and really, I think, made him, you know, it is,
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:42.160]   branded his form of recovery or of treatment. And he thought that he had this experience that
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:47.520]   he describes in this book where he's sitting up on the third, he ran one of the biggest sanitariums
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:53.920]   in Europe, in Zurich, and he was sitting up on the third floor of this building,
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:21:03.200]   and he's talking to a patient who was describing her dream to him, and the fulcrum of that dream
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:11.200]   was a scarab beetle, which was an insect that is very, very uncommon, if at all, in Northern Europe,
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:18.320]   but it's a common figure in the iconography of Egypt and the hieroglyphics on the walls of the
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:27.360]   pyramids, etc. And while he was talking to her, he heard this "bing, bing, bing" on the window
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:32.000]   behind him, and he didn't want to turn around to take his attention off her, but finally he does
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.440]   it. In exasperation, he turns around, he throws up the window, and a scarab beetle flies in and
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:42.000]   lands in his hand, and he shows it to the woman, and he says, "Is this what you were thinking of?
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:48.080]   Is this what you were dreaming about?" And he was struck by that experience, which was similar to
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:54.400]   other experiences he's had like that, and that's what synchronicity means. It's an incident,
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:02.960]   a coincidence, you know? And like, if you're talking with somebody that you haven't thought
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:09.120]   about in 20 years, and that person calls on the phone, that's synchronicity. And he believed it
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:15.520]   was a way that God intervened in our lives that broke all the rules of nature that he had set up,
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:21.760]   the rules of physics, the rules of mathematics, you know, to reach in and sort of tap us on the
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:28.320]   shoulder and say, "I'm here." And so he tried to reproduce that in a clinical setting,
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:34.000]   and he would put one guy in one room and another guy in another room and have them flip cards and
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.040]   guess what the other guy had flipped. And he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance,
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:44.960]   laws of mathematics, that he would approve the existence of an unnatural law, a supernatural
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:50.480]   law, and that was the first step to proving the existence of a God. He never succeeds in doing it,
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.920]   but he says in the book, "Even though I can't prove using empirical and scientific tools the
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:03.120]   existence of a God, I can show through anecdotal evidence, having seen thousands of patients come
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:08.080]   through this institution, that people who believe in God get better faster and that the recovery is
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:14.480]   more enduring than people who don't." And for me, hearing that was more impactful than if he
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:19.200]   had claimed that he had proved the existence of a God, because I would not believe that.
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:26.640]   But I was already at a mindset where I would have done anything I could to improve my chances of
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:33.600]   never having to take drugs again by even 1%. And if believing in God was going to help me,
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:39.920]   whether there's a God up there or not, believing in one itself had the power to help me, I was
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:44.080]   going to do that. So then the question is, how do you start believing in something that you can't
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:51.520]   see or smell or hear or touch or taste or acquire with your senses? And Jung provides the formula
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:57.680]   for that, and he says, "Act as if. You fake it till you make it." And so that's what I started
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:03.680]   doing. I just started pretending there was a God watching me all the time, and life was a series
[02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:08.800]   of tests, and there was a bunch of moral decisions that I had to make every day. And each one,
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.600]   these were all just little things that I did, but each one now, for me, had a moral dimension.
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:21.440]   When the alarm goes off, do I lay in bed for an extra 10 minutes with my indolent thoughts,
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:29.280]   or do I jump right out of bed? Do I make my most important decision of the day? Do I hang up the
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:38.400]   towels? When I go into the closet and pull out my blue jeans and a bunch of those wire hangers
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:44.240]   fall on the ground, do I shut the door and say, "I'm too important to do that, that somebody else's
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:51.040]   job," or not? And so, do I put the water in the ice tray before I put it in the freezer? Do I put
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:57.200]   the shopping cart back in the place that it's supposed to go, in the parking lot of the Safeway?
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.480]   And if I make a whole bunch of those choices right,
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:10.560]   that I maintain myself in a posture of surrender, which keeps me open to the power of, to my higher
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:18.400]   power, to my God. And when I do those things right, when I, you know, so much about addiction
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:26.240]   is about abuse of power, abuse of, all of us have some power, whether it's our good looks, or whether
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:36.240]   it's, you know, connections, or education, or family, or whatever. And there's always a temptation
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:43.040]   to use those to fulfill self-will. And the challenge is, how do you use those always to
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:50.400]   serve instead God's will and, you know, the good of our community? And that, to me, is kind of the
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:26:00.240]   struggle. And when I do that, I feel God's power coming through me, and that I can do things. I'm
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:09.040]   much more effective as a human being. That gnawing, you know, anxiety that I lived with for so many
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:17.600]   years, and my God, that, it's gone. And that I can kind of, like, put down the oars and hoist the
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:23.760]   sail, and you know, and the wind takes me. And I can see the evidence of it in my life.
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:32.960]   And you know, the big thing, the temptation for me is that when all these good things start
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:38.960]   happening in my life, and the cash and prizes start flowing in, you know, how do I maintain
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:44.480]   that posture of surrender? How do I stay surrendered then when my inclination is to say to God,
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:51.280]   "Thanks, God, I got it from here," and drive the car off the cliff again? And so, you know,
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:57.440]   I had a spiritual awakening, and my desire for drugs and alcohol was lifted miraculously.
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:05.360]   And to me, it was as much a miracle as if I'd been able to walk on water. Because I had tried
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:11.760]   everything earnestly, sincerely, and honestly for a decade to try to stop, and I could not do it
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:18.160]   under my own power. And then all of a sudden, it was lifted effortlessly. And you know, so I saw
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:27.760]   that evidence, early evidence of God in my life, and of the power. And I see it now, you know,
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:30.640]   every day of my life. - So adding that
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:36.160]   moral dimension to all of your actions is how you were able to win that Camus battle against
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:38.480]   the absurd. - Exactly.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.800]   - Sisyphus with the bull. - It's all the same thing.
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.920]   It's the battle to just do the right thing. - And now Sisyphus was able to find somehow
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:46.640]   happiness. - Yeah.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:52.160]   - (laughs) Well, Bobby, thank you for the stroll through some of the most important moments in
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:58.640]   recent human history, and for running for president. And thank you for talking today.
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.000]   - Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:07.120]   conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:13.040]   description. And now let me leave you with some words from John F. Kennedy. "Let us not seek the
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:18.880]   Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:25.840]   for the past. Instead, let us accept our own responsibility for the future." Thank you for
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:28.240]   listening, and hope to see you next time.
