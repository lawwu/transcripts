I suppose he's referring to cultural issues, identity politics. Well, you know, Jordan trying to get me to badmouth the left the whole time. I really enjoyed my talk with him.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:48.480]   and I talk with him. Yeah. He seemed to have that agenda where he wanted me to, you know, say bad things about the left. I just don't, you know, that's not what my campaign is about. I want to do the opposite. I'm not going to badmouth the left. They try. I, you know, I was on a show this week with David Remnick from the New Yorker, and he tried to get me to badmouth Donald Trump and, you know, and Alex Jones and a lot of other people just and and dating me to do it.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:42:17.540]  , and of course, there's a lot of bad things I could say about all those people, but it doesn't, you know, I'm trying to find I'm trying to find values that hold us together and we can share in common rather than to focus constantly on these disputes and these issues that drive us apart. So me sitting here bad mouthing the left or bad mouthing the right is not going to advance the ball. I really want to figure out ways that, you know, what do these groups do?
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:46.600]   What do these groups hold in common that we can all, you know, have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like? Well, that's music to my ears. But in that spirit, let me ask you a difficult question. Then you wrote a book harshly criticizing Anthony Fauci. Let me ask you to steal me on the case for the people who support him. What is the biggest positive thing you think Anthony Fauci did for the world? What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:46.600]   The first thing I want to ask you is, what is the biggest positive thing you think Anthony Fauci did for the world? What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:46.600]   What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:46.600]   What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:43:15.660]  , I don't want to sit here and speak uncharitably by saying the guy didn't do anything, but I don't, I can't think of anything. I mean, if you, if you tell me something that you think he did, maybe there was a drug that got licensed while he was at NIH that benefited people, that's certainly possible. He was there for 50 years.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.640]   What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?

[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.100]   What was it possible to have within a capitalist system to produce medication, to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt?
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:56.600]   Yeah, of course.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.120]   Yeah, of course.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:57.120]   Yeah, of course. Yeah.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:27.080]   I mean, it's a big problem. Of course it is. through a solid regulatory regimen where drugs are actually tested. The problem is not the capitalist system. The capitalist system I have great admiration for and I love the capitalist system. It's the greatest economic engine ever devised, but it has to be harnessed to a social purpose. Otherwise, it leads us down the road.

[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:11.400]   So almost 50% of FDA's budget comes from pharmaceutical companies.

[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:51.620]   In fact, there's a word for those kind of scientists who take money for their opinion, and the word is by "ostitutes."

[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:42.140]   There are numerous times that I've made mistakes on Twitter, and I apologize for it.
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:42.140]   People say to me, "Oh, that's weird. I've never seen anybody apologize on Twitter."
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:42.140]   I think it's really important. Of course human beings make mistakes. My book is 230,000, 40,000, 50,000 words. There's going to be a mistake in there.
