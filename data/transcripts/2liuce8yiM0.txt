[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Countries that are getting ready to join the EU, they improve their economic
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.080]   freedom scores, their sort of laissez-fairness on the path to getting
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.360]   ready for joining the EU, and then they may increase it a little bit
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.040]   afterwards once they join, but basically it's like when you're deciding to join
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120]   the EU, it's like you decided you have your Rocky training montage and get more
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.760]   laissez-faire and so the EU on net is a mess, it pulls in the direction of markets
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.720]   compared to where Europe would be otherwise.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480]   I mean, look at the nations that are in the EU now, right?
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.120]   A lot of them are east of Germany, right?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.600]   And so those are countries that don't have this great history of being market
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   friendly and a lot of parties aren't that market friendly, and yet the EU sort of
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.320]   nags them into their version, like as much markets as they can handle.
