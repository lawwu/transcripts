[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.920]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.000]   My name is Josh Rashids. I'm your host. Today we continue our series on how to invest into
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.640]   your children effectively at a very young age. Today we're going to continue talking about how
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.520]   to make your children smarter. By way of review very quickly, in episode one we talked about the
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.280]   importance of being careful who you choose to mate with, because the person that you choose to mate
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.400]   with is going to fundamentally drive the genetic potential of your children. In episode two,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.240]   we talked about the importance of ensuring a good, strong, healthy pregnancy and a successful
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.280]   childbirth. In episode three, we talked about helping your children to develop their bodies.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120]   You want to invest into helping your children develop strong bodies. We talked about nutrition,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.240]   sleep, movement, sunshine, etc. In episode four of this series, we talked about giving your children
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.640]   words and background knowledge. I explained that if you're going to invest into your children's
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.400]   minds, you begin with physicality, making sure they have good nutrition, no toxins, lots of
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.080]   exercise, etc. And then you need to start to build the mind. And when we think about making your
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   children smarter, there are two basic components of that. Literacy and numeracy are a useful outline
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.920]   for us to work from. So we started by talking about the importance of giving your children
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.840]   words. And I focused heavily in that episode on the importance of giving your children words at
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.320]   the earliest age. I explained how if you want your baby to be smart, then you need to expose
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   your baby to lots and lots of meaningful words. And if at all possible, you want that vocabulary
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.800]   that your child is exposed to to be extremely broad. You don't want to just work with the few
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.000]   thousand most common words. You want your child to be exposed to tens of thousands of uncommon
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.200]   words. And that the more your child hears at an early age, the farther ahead and the easier time
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.680]   your child will have in his academic pursuits. I broke that into the importance of background
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.240]   knowledge and the importance of words, just the sheer quantity of words. So in today's episode,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.920]   we're going to continue on that theme. And I'm going to seek to impress upon you that point
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.000]   afresh of how important the number of words are. The number is, excuse me, the number of words is
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.520]   to your child's overall intellectual potential. And then talk to you about how do you actually
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.040]   do that in an effective way? How? And I'm seeking to make this very practical. How do you do it?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.000]   How do you actually help your child to be smarter in ways that are going to be measured in cognitive
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.040]   ability, especially with regard to literacy? Remember, if there is a metric that is most
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:17.280]   important to track when your child is young in terms of his mental development, how smart he can
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.360]   be, that metric is simply the number of words that your child hears on a daily basis. In a perfect
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.120]   world, from this metric, your child would hear nothing but constant human speech in meaningful
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   context and high quality, high level literature. Now, obviously, there are many other things that
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.320]   are important for your child's development. Sleep is important. You don't want his sleep
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.800]   interrupted by words. Play is important. You don't want his play interrupted by words. Silence
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.480]   is important to have time to think and to process, etc. Children shouldn't have words going into
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.120]   their heads all the time. But you're trying to maximize, within those other constraints,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.960]   trying to maximize the number of words that go into your children's minds. And these words
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.040]   are going to give your child the background knowledge that he needs in order to understand
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:23.440]   the world in addition to improving his overall academic ability. Let me read a smart quote
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   on this topic. I'm reading here from a book called The Read Aloud Family, and the author
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   of this book is citing an interview that she performed on her podcast, The Read Aloud Revival
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.920]   Podcast with Dr. Joseph Price. "Dr. Joseph Price, Associate Professor of Economics at Brigham Young
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.720]   University, specializes in the economics of family and education. His research demonstrates that one
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.680]   extra day per week of parent-child read aloud sessions during the first 10 years of a child's
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   life increases standardized test scores by half a standard deviation. That's as many as 15 to 30
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   percentile points, a tremendous gain." In a separate note, "In The Read Aloud Handbook,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.000]   Jim Trulise suggests that the academic benefits alone of reading aloud are so great, if someone
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.440]   invented a pill to deliver those benefits, there would be a line for miles and miles to get it.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.080]   Parents would fall over themselves and pay enormous amounts of money to give their kids
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.720]   the benefit of this pill." He cites the 1985 Commission on Reading that I mentioned in Chapter
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.840]   1. "The single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.480]   success in reading is reading aloud to children." Trulise also describes the results of research
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which showed that
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.840]   the more children are read to, the higher their test scores are, sometimes by as much as half a
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.280]   year's schooling. This was true regardless of a family's income. He goes on to say that reading
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.600]   aloud has proven to be so powerful in increasing a child's academic success that it is more effective
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.120]   than expensive tutoring or even private education. "Parents often ask me if they should play Mozart to
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.360]   their babies or buy them expensive teaching toys or prohibit television or get them started early
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.120]   on a computer," Trulise writes, "but the answer is much simpler. Read to your children." This is just
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the research and data that explains the power that
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.360]   reading aloud has on a child's academic growth. She goes on to, in another direction, to lay out
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.920]   some of the benefits of reading. The three benefits that she talks about in this book,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.200]   benefit number one, increased vocabulary and highly sophisticated language patterns, that's
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.080]   benefit number one. Benefit number two, the ability to make connections, in other words,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.280]   reading comprehension. And benefit number three is a love for reading. When you start to think
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.720]   about how to make your child smarter, there are different ways in which you can think about that.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.040]   One is at the basic physical level. You can say, "How can I make my child physically smarter? How
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.960]   can I increase the number of neural connections in his brain?" Or you can think about it in the
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   more common sense way. "How can I make my child smarter about this subject?" Well, if you want to
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.880]   be smarter, you need to expose yourself to information and wisdom in a meaningful context
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.240]   and then apply and express that. And that's why most of what we talk about in terms of reading
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.080]   aloud is going to usher in a lifetime of reading. Reading aloud is not something that is opposed to
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.960]   reading. I think that I myself am firmly convinced that reading aloud is a practice that should
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:49.680]   continue for life, both for children and for adults, because it adds all the benefits of reading
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.720]   and it brings some benefits that aren't otherwise there. Let me break this down so you understand it
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   and then we'll talk about how to apply it. Reading aloud allows a child to access information and
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:10.080]   ideas that are beyond his current ability to read with his eyes. And this is something that you can
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   use. This is a technique that you can use to challenge your children's brains when their eyes
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.400]   are not yet ready. I have the good fortune of having experienced this personally with my own
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   reading journey quite recently, as well as tutoring and helping my children to become skilled readers.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   I've paid careful attention to this in my journey with reading in foreign languages,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:43.920]   and I have learned how difficult it is to consume written content when you are not a skilled and
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:51.120]   competent reader. I primarily learn languages by reading. But reading, when you're not a good
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:58.240]   reader, when you're not a totally skilled reader, is something that takes work. It tires you out.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.480]   I'm a very accomplished reader in English. For me, reading in English is effortless. Not to say that
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.840]   all materials are effortless. If I find something, a subject which I'm not skilled in, I need to go
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   slow and carefully parse the words and understand the meaning, of course that's more tiring.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.280]   But in general, generalized reading is effortless. But when I move into a foreign language,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:28.640]   that effortlessness is gone and it's replaced with effort. So one of the tools that I use is I
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   listen to an audiobook while simultaneously reading the material with my eyes. And that
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:42.960]   helps me to keep going, to keep pressing forward, because it's easier to listen than it is to read.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   The same is true with children. It's easier for them to listen than it is for them to read.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.320]   So if you have that practice of reading aloud, your four-year-old can listen to something that
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.080]   he would never be able to read, even if he is able to actually parse the words. But yet he gets all
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.200]   of the benefits of reading at a very early age. Reading is a unique and special technology.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:15.520]   A lot of times people contrast reading with things like absorbing content on the screen,
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.760]   a movie or a film or some kind of video production.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.280]   I don't think that these things should be seen as in opposition to one another.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:35.200]   Novels are not better or worse than movies. They are different technologies. There are things that
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.680]   are so much better learned and expressed through reading than movies. And there are things that are
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.200]   so much better expressed through movies than through reading. And so if we understand the
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.480]   distinctions between these technologies, we'll be able to use them where they are unique and
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:02.880]   most powerful. Of the two, generally I think reading is a more impactful technology than a
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.560]   movie for a few basic reasons. First, if you want your child to be smart, you need to stimulate your
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:18.160]   child's brain. And reading does that because reading requires active participation of the
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:26.320]   reader in the story. When you're reading a story and listening to a description, your brain has to
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.240]   build a mental picture of that description. And to follow the story, you have to carefully watch it
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   through and your brain has to rely exclusively on words to form that mental picture. Reading is a
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.560]   much more involved tech—mental—it's much more mentally taxing than watching something on a
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.880]   screen. When you're watching something on a screen, you are just simply a passive observer.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.760]   That what you're observing can touch you, it can touch your emotions, it can feed you
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.920]   inspiration, it can touch you with facts, it can help you just to see in a very accurate way.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.240]   But you're still a passive observer. You're not as fired up. That's why most of us, if we have a
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.760]   long and tiring week and we just want to take it easy, very rarely are we going to go and pick up
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.280]   a Charles Dickens novel. Rather, we're going to go and say, "Let me goof around and find something on
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.520]   Netflix and find some rom-com that's going to fill up about two hours and allow me to relax."
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.680]   Watching TV, watching movies, is generally a relaxing experience. Reading can be a relaxing
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.120]   experience, but is often not. And it's because the brain requires more—reading requires more
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.880]   active participation from the brain. Another thing that is—another benefit to reading that I think
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:52.240]   is really important is the ability to get inside the mind of a character. When an author is writing
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:13:01.040]   a story, the author, as the omniscient God, can carefully describe every thought that every
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.720]   protagonist is having. And that can allow your brain to follow along these grooves along with
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   the character. So, your brain can experience fear, your brain can experience anger, your brain can
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.440]   experience hopefulness or hopelessness in a very, very powerful way simply by going along with the
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.160]   thought patterns of the protagonist. If the author is describing for several paragraphs or, in some
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   cases, several pages what the protagonist is thinking in the story, your brain will automatically
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:44.240]   be experiencing that just alongside him. This last year, I read the book Count of Monte Cristo and
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   [music]

[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   It was, I had, I don't remember if I'd read it in English or not, I had seen the movie
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.640]   previously and this time I read the original unabridged version in French. And it was the
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:35.360]   most powerful book I read all year. It touched me so incredibly deeply. I was in tears. I sat
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.080]   in my chair sobbing and I'm not, I'm not engaging in hyperbole. I literally sat in my chair sobbing
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.600]   at several points throughout the book. It's a very intensely emotional book. If you have not read it,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:54.240]   I would urge you read it. In whatever translation you want, grab the audiobook, but get the full
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.920]   original unabridged book. What stood out to me so much about the story was that I experienced
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.680]   the breadth of human emotion in reading the story. The book begins on a very hopeful note,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:16.960]   and you're filled with joy and appreciation for the good things that are happening in the
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.800]   life of the protagonist. Then the book turns from hopeful to hopeless, and you experience this sense
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:36.160]   of despondency and despair. And the protagonist is treated so immorally, so evilly, that you're
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.760]   filled with this hatred for the people who are doing this to him. And there's a point in there
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.480]   which he's utterly hopeless, and I just remember the emotions of the experience. And I'm not going
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.320]   to go on through all the emotions, but you experience all of these things. You experience
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:59.200]   anger, you experience revenge, then you experience sympathy and appreciation of what happens when you
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:05.520]   take revenge on people. And it's something that I've never experienced a movie that could take
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.840]   me through those emotions in such a powerful way. And so, for children especially, I believe this is
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   really, really important, a really important way for helping our children not only to be
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   intellectually smart, but to be emotionally intelligent as well. Listen to this excerpt,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:32.000]   this story that illustrates this. "When Rebecca Gonzalez was elementary school age, her mother,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.360]   Toni, read aloud Johnny Tremaine by Esther Forbes. Set in Boston during the events leading up to the
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.680]   Revolutionary War, the book tells the story of a 14-year-old apprentice silversmith. After Johnny's
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.080]   hand is disfigured and disabled, he ends up working as a horse-riding messenger for the
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.600]   Sons of Liberty. As her mother read the book aloud, Rebecca fell fast for Johnny,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.960]   thoroughly enjoying his adventurous story of loyalty and courage. The next summer,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.720]   Rebecca attended vacation Bible school and came home each night to talk incessantly about her new
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   best friend, Billy. Every night she told her mother about the funny things he had said,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.960]   how smart he was at Bible memory, his cool t-shirt and stylish hair, his award for camper of the day.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.040]   Toni wasn't able to meet Billy until the final day of VBS.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.720]   When Rebecca called Billy over to introduce him to her mother, Toni received a surprise.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.080]   Billy made his way over to Rebecca and Toni, leaning heavily on his walker.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.920]   It was only then that Toni realized something. Billy had cerebral palsy. During all of those
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   conversations about her new best friend, Rebecca had never once mentioned it. That day, Toni noticed
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.800]   that most of Rebecca's vacation Bible school classmates were uncomfortable in Billy's presence.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   When she asked her daughter about the new friendship, Rebecca credited her fictional
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.200]   friend Johnny Tremaine, who had taught her what it might feel like to be disabled,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:02.240]   and therefore different from everyone else. That's an anecdote from the Read Aloud Family book.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.560]   The point of the story is, we've all had that. There's an old saying, an old aphorism,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.840]   it says something like, "Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes."
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.000]   But it's hard to go and actually walk a mile in another man's shoes. The next best thing to that
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.600]   is to read about the mile that he's walking in his shoes and allow your brain to experience the
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:38.240]   same kinds of experiences that man is having. And so, reading stories fills in not only facts and
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   background knowledge, but emotions and empathy, and it helps with the emotional maturing and
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.440]   emotional intelligence of our children in an extremely powerful way. I think this is why it's
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.560]   important that we expose our children to a broad range of literature. I want my children to know
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:04.080]   what it's like to be bullied and to bully. Not in reality, but vicariously through stories. I want
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.480]   my children to understand what it's like to be in different cultures, to be in different parts
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.320]   of the world, to understand the optimism that a man born in one life position feels, and the
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:23.920]   despair and pessimism that a boy born in another life position can feel and experience.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:32.480]   And reading is the best way to fully engage the brain in these events. Back to reading aloud.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:41.440]   Your youngest children are not going to be able to access the stories if they have to wait
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:48.560]   until they are physically capable of reading them with their eyes. But you can invest for years
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   into their experiences by reading aloud to them. And they are always going to be able to access
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.920]   stories at a higher level if they're listening to those stories. You and I, as adults, can listen
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.520]   to material that is much harder than what we can read comfortably. And that's always the case.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.560]   Again, I've proved it with foreign languages again and again, and I see it with my children
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.160]   again and again. So, reading aloud is your cornerstone. How do you do it? First thing you
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.120]   need to read aloud successfully to your children is you need books. You need access to books. And
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.440]   that starts with knowing which books to read. Here, since you're listening to me speak in English,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.000]   I want to encourage you that assuming you're reading to your children in English, that you
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.440]   have an embarrassment of riches. I have searched the world, and I continue to search the world,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.480]   for high-quality lists of children's literature in other languages. And I am amazed at the
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.760]   difference between English and other languages in terms of book lists. I can, off the top of my head,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.320]   give you half a dozen book lists, all of which are excellent lists that you can use to choose
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.600]   your children's literature from. Let me go ahead and do that. First, if you have not read the Read
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.360]   Aloud Handbook by Jim Trelise, immediately get a copy of it. In the back of that book is a
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.320]   bibliography, a list of books that will be suitable and appropriate for you to read with your children.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:22.880]   I today read two excerpts from the book called The Read Aloud Family. Look up The Read Aloud
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.960]   Family. In the back of that book are a couple of book lists. I like the book Honey for a Child's
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   Heart, which is a book dedicated to book lists and filled with, again, high-quality book
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.360]   recommendations. There's another book I have called Books That Build Character.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:48.000]   In this particular book is a book that is full of book lists, telling you books that talk about
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:58.480]   virtue and character development. Online you can find all kinds of reading lists. One of my favorites
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.560]   that I think is really powerful is the reading list for the free online homeschool curriculum
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:13.360]   put out at Ambleside Online, amblesideonline.org. If you go to the Ambleside Online curriculum page,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.520]   for each year they have 12 years of curriculum prepared, which although not a perfect fit for
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.160]   first grade, second grade, third grade, because the grade level is somewhat meaningless, you can
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.320]   be a little bit ahead or a little bit behind and still be in the process of gaining an excellent
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:38.400]   education. It's a useful corollary to the American system of 12 school years. And for each year,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:45.360]   they have a list of what are called free reads. And this is a wonderful list of books that you
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.240]   can read from, have your children read, and many of them are excellent read aloud
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:00.960]   recommendations. The Institute for Excellence in Writing publishes a great list of books. They
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.000]   have one that's called Books for Boys and Other People Who Would Rather Build Fortsall Than Read
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.280]   a Book or something like that. It's a great list of novels for active boys who want strong
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:20.000]   books with lots of action in them. Mensa publishes a book list. There are just so many book lists out
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.120]   there. Basically, what I'm encouraging is go find a book list and use those titles and start pulling
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.800]   from them. So, the first thing you need to get is books. And it starts with a book list, a list that
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:39.360]   you can pull titles from. Then you need access to those books. Here, the question would be,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.160]   should I get them from the library or should I own the books? In general, I think obviously the
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:53.760]   library is a really great resource. Unfortunately, I'm much more cautious these days about the
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   library than I was when I was younger. When I was a boy, I would go to the library with my mom
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.640]   once a week or so, and I would usually check out 50 books. I would take a big bag and I would check
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.680]   out 50 books, and then a week later bring them back and turn them in and go again. There's
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:13.440]   nothing better than a library for allowing a child access to a broad range of books.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.840]   And remember, not all books are designed to be read from cover to cover. And in fact,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.000]   this is one of the great advantages of the technology of books. Unlike the technology of
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.280]   audio, unlike the technology of video, the technology of books allows a book to be skimmed
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   with profit. So, if you want to gain an overview of a subject, skimming a book and kind of dipping
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:48.080]   your toe in here and there is an important skill, and it's a perfectly valid form of reading that
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.200]   individuals should develop. If you can only consume a book from front to back, you are not
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.680]   a skilled reader. A skilled reader can consume a book in many different ways. And so, having access
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.920]   to a broad range of books is really, really important and useful. This also helps if you
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.000]   have access to huge numbers of books from the library, this also helps your children to develop
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.240]   background knowledge. I can distinctly point back and I can identify things in my own knowledge
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   base that came from my broad skim reading of library books. When I was a boy, I learned how
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.680]   to fly a helicopter. I learned how to do organic gardening. I learned all about ultralights. I
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.240]   learned all these different subjects. Now, I say learned, of course, in a tongue-in-cheek way,
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:45.760]   I read about them. And while I don't, I certainly don't pretend that that knowledge is as good as
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:53.600]   real experiential knowledge, that broad knowledge base has given me many, many advantages in life.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.160]   And it came from 50 books a week, basically week in, week out for many, many years.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:06.080]   Unfortunately, I've lost faith, I've lost confidence in many of the local library systems.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.800]   The last time I took my children into a library, the library was, they had pornography in the
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:20.000]   children's section. And it was really quite disturbing to see that. And so, most libraries,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.040]   as a way of getting around that, most libraries will allow you to use their hold and reserve
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.200]   system. And what we have done is started to move to that hold and reserve system. Instead of taking
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.480]   our children, just letting them browse the shelves and pick their own books, we put the books on hold
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.360]   and then just go and pick them up. So, if you're dealing with a government library or something
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.160]   like that, then be careful in our current age as far as the things that your children will be
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.400]   exposed to. There is also an increasing movement towards what are called living libraries. The
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:59.680]   term living library is probably an offshoot of the term living book. And that term is hard to define.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   Here, a simplistic definition I would give is just simply a very high quality, very engaging,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.120]   very carefully selected book. And if you have access in your area to a living library,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.520]   sign up, pay the membership fee, and it'll be worth every cent. Just an amazing resource.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:25.680]   When I browse one of our local living libraries book selections, I'm amazed at the high quality
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:32.160]   of those selections and how wonderful it is to have a dedicated librarian who is committed to
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.840]   choosing the highest quality books. So, check around in your area, see if you have a living
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.920]   library. These are usually independent. They're not affiliated with any large-scale organization
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.360]   or government entity. They're not necessarily intended to be a non-profit, but I think
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.840]   at least all the ones that I have seen wind up being non-profit organizations.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.200]   There is a membership fee where you sign up, pay a membership fee, but the librarians usually have
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.800]   such a passion for quality literature that they wind up spending all of their would-be profits on
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.960]   more books for their library. So, they're non-for-profit endeavors, but they're just a
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:18.720]   wonderful resource. You also need access to the books and you need time to read them.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:27.120]   Those amounts of reading should be large. It should be significant. So, I mentioned
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.960]   in the previous episode, my personal target is two hours a day. A number of years ago,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   I read a great book called Teaching the Trivium by Harvey and Lori Bluedorn, and they said this
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   is this should be the goal, two hours a day. I like it when people give me a goal, and so I set
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   that as my goal, and I do pretty well. I probably hit that five days a week, four to five days a
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.000]   week. Not every day, but I hit it four to five days a week. Then my wife also reads to the
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.200]   children, and so I don't track her hours, but it varies sometimes a lot, sometimes less.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.560]   But it's important that you note that with children, you can't do it all at once,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.600]   nor would you want to. It's exhausting and tiring to do a good job reading for an hour straight,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:17.120]   and children don't have the attention span to engage with books for that long of a period.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:24.880]   What you do is you intersperse your child's day with little chunks of reading here and there.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:31.440]   I read sometimes a book before breakfast with a couple of children, and now that my children's
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.400]   age ranges vary quite a lot, I want to make time for the picture books with the younger ones and
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.360]   make time for special books with the older ones. I read at the breakfast table, I read at the lunch
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.880]   table, I read at the dinner table, sometimes before dinner, many times after dinner, etc.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.280]   But if you put in chunks of 15-20 minutes here and there, pretty soon you can get to an hour,
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.360]   hour and a half, two hours or more per day. And then that works really well with the children's
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.880]   attention span. The other thing I do is I try to be thoughtful in terms of when and how I read
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:08.720]   certain books. So picture books that really engage the interest of my littlest children,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.640]   I of course read those on the couch where we can snuggle up and they'll be totally focused.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.040]   Longer chapter books that I think are really wonderful and powerful books, but that aren't
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   going to engage my younger children. If I want them to be listening, because again I want them
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.720]   to grow their attention span and their ability to pay attention, but they're going to need something
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.240]   to do with their hands, so often I'll do those at meal times. Their hands are busy, their mouths are
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   full, they don't get too wiggly, and it helps to stretch them out. And even just listening to an
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.520]   audiobook or listening to a book being read to you, that is a skill that helps your child to
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.120]   develop attention span, develop the ability to sit still, to focus, etc. I don't want to go too
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.840]   deeply into more tips here. I would urge you again read aloud a handbook and read aloud family, two
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.040]   good resources, but don't expect your children to be totally still. Many times make a snack,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:05.440]   give them food, read to them at times when their hands are busy. I'll go and when I go through an
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.200]   episode of my day and show you how I try to put all the stuff into a normal day,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.920]   all these techniques and tips that I'm talking about, I'll go in detail through it, but
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.760]   I build little traditions. And so, you know, at 10 30 in the morning we have a protein shake.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.400]   Well, that's the time that we read this book, and then at noon we read the other book, etc.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.720]   And so, you're just building up your children's stamina over time and doing it in a soft way,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.920]   but with a goal of stretching them out to a very long attention span, so they can start moving and
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:43.840]   developing not only the intellectual ability, not only the words, not only the linguistic skills,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.680]   but also things like being able to do long, huge amounts of deep work in the future,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.800]   which will help them. I see it as a valid investment into my youngest of children
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:02.240]   that I'm helping prepare their brains to focus intently on difficult work for long periods of
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:10.000]   time in the future. And I want to engage with the subject of audiobooks, because I believe audiobooks
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:20.880]   are a magic tool that we have today that has not been nearly as accessible as even 10 or 20 years
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:28.400]   ago, and yet can really supercharge our results. And we owe this tool primarily to the existence
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:39.040]   of Audible and other audiobook platforms. People reading books aloud has been around forever,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.680]   and in fact, oral traditions were far more common. If you went back a couple thousand years,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:51.040]   you would find that it was very common to have a reader. All of the Hebrew and New Testament
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.080]   scriptures were designed to be read aloud. There would be one scroll or one letter that made the
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.520]   rounds and then a reader to read it. It's a tradition of people reading aloud. So, in many
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.840]   ways, you would say that the technology of each person having an individual book and reading that
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:13.520]   book is fairly new. But it wasn't as…audiobooks were not as accessible in the past as they are
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:21.760]   today. And I think that we need to pay attention to how good this has gotten. I did not grow up
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:28.160]   listening to a lot of audiobooks. We had a few treasured cassette series that we listened to
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.360]   again and again, but the prices were high, and we listened to those same books again and again
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:40.000]   and again, usually on family car trips. Then CDs came out, and that made the technology better,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and then libraries started to acquire audiobook series and CDs. But over the last decade,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.520]   we've of course enjoyed the digital revolution, where most of us now listen to audio that's
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:58.880]   linked to our digital device rather than a CD or an audio cassette. And libraries have also
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:04.320]   supported that. And so, now you can borrow from your local library audiobooks.

[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:50.240]   paid versions of Audible, Audiobooks.com, etc., where you have access to great, great audiobooks.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.320]   Years ago, in the histories of Radical Personal Finance, I did a podcast dedicated to all the
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.680]   different options. At the time, I was using several different audiobook platforms. These
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.320]   days, I've pretty much just standardized on Audible as being one of the best solutions out there.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:14.560]   Today, you can get an Audible membership that basically brings almost any title to a maximum
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:22.400]   cost of $11, which means that if you sign up for a plan of two or three books per month,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:33.920]   for $20 or $30, you can gain access to 30 to 60 to possibly more, shorter books, 15 to 50 hours
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:40.160]   of audio per month that's available to you of the highest quality audio. And the audiobook selection
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:49.760]   is huge and is growing. Audiobooks are really valuable to helping you enhance the intellectual
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.920]   abilities of your children because they take most of the benefits of reading aloud and they
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:03.040]   add those benefits beyond what you yourself as a parent are able to provide to your children.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:10.560]   I don't think that audiobooks are better than you reading aloud to your children, which is why
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:18.400]   I intentionally focus on my doing the reading aloud to my children, because there are a whole
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.840]   host of other relationship benefits associated with that. I'm building an emotional connection
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.800]   with my children when I read aloud to them. They're snuggling on my lap, or they're snuggled
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.960]   up next to me, or they're hearing my voices, my rendition. I can stop, I can explain things,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:41.360]   we can talk about the subject matter of the book if it's controversial, etc.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.760]   And then also, by having these things together, it becomes part of our family culture.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.880]   One of the great benefits of reading books together with your children is they become
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   useful skills or useful tools for you to talk about life, but to do it in an impersonal way.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:15.280]   So, let's say that you want to talk with your teenage son about women, or your teenage daughter
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:23.200]   about relationships. It can be difficult to do that, especially if you want to point out something
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.560]   in a, let's say you notice someone in your friend group, or someone at your church, or someone in
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:34.000]   your company who just has this certain behavior that is totally inappropriate. You don't want to
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   tell your son or daughter, "Listen, child, you see that person over there and what they're doing?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.360]   How horrific. Don't ever do that." That's a wrong way to, that brings people down. It's a wrong
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.680]   thing to do, generally speaking. But if you read a book together, and you read Pride and Prejudice,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.080]   and you get all this intrigue about all these relationships, etc., you now have an opportunity
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.680]   to say, "Well, what do you think about this protagonist's actions? Or what do you think
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:04.000]   they should have done?" etc. And so, having a book that's in common, and books that have positive
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.480]   examples, and books that have negative examples, gives you a really great springboard for discussing
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.200]   important and serious topics with your children, but doing it in a way where you're not harming
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.840]   other people, you're not talking down about other people, or gossiping about other real people.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.600]   It's one of the reasons books are so important. So, reading aloud is important, but audiobooks
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:33.760]   provide all those benefits of intellectual growth, and they fill in around the edges. Remember,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:39.680]   the basic metric that we want to count is the number of words heard by the child. That number
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.960]   of words, we don't want 24 hours a day of words, but we do want the number of words to be high.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:51.680]   But I get tired. I get tired as a reader. I get tired of certain things. That's where audiobooks
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.000]   come in. Audiobooks allow us to listen to stories in the car. And for some families, there may be
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.920]   five hours a week, ten hours a week of great audio. By the way, I think the car is often best
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.200]   reserved for conversation, but what I have noticed with my young children, though I believe that
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:16.160]   conversation is really valuable, my young children aren't so great at it yet. And car rides often
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.240]   become loud and quite unpleasant if there's not some activity. So, listening to a family audiobook
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:30.960]   in the car together is a wonderful way of exposing your children to high quality, to all these
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.320]   benefits, a great story together, and it's a great way of making use of the dead time. And back to
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:48.480]   the concept of children being capable of far higher reading levels. One of the techniques I use
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.160]   with audiobooks is I use the car as a place where they're a captive audience. Let me take a slight
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:01.760]   detour for a moment into a topic of how reading can be used to make you smarter in the long run.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:10.080]   There is a model of education that is often called the classical model. And this idea of
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.960]   classical model of education, it's hard to pin down, hard to define accurately, and there are
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.240]   different definitions depending on who you're talking to and in what context you're using it.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.560]   But a component of the classical model generally involves some relation to what is called the
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:32.400]   trivium. The trivium is an allusion back to the classic Greek and Roman conception of the three
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:39.760]   basic areas of knowledge, which they called grammar, logic, and rhetoric. And in the neoclassical model,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.800]   these ideas of grammar, logic, and rhetoric are often applied on an age perspective, right? You
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.320]   start in the beginning with grammar stage of learning, logic stage, rhetoric, etc. I look at
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:57.040]   these as a natural encapsulation of how you learn about something. And one of the important things
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.600]   we want to teach our children is how to learn. And so we want to, if you're going to go into a new
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.480]   subject, the first thing you'd learn is you learn the basic grammar of the subject, all of the basic
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.560]   words, their meanings, the basic arguments, etc. You learn all the basics of the subject. Then you
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.920]   go on in your learning and you start to think about the arguments inherent in those subjects.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:24.320]   And then later you express your own perspectives or your opinions using rhetoric related to the
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.000]   arguments of those subjects. So let me give you a financial example. If you were brand new to
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   personal finance, you would begin by learning the grammar. And let's say I use terms like tax
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:45.040]   brackets or tax rates or tax itself or income tax or employment tax. These are all words that need
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.680]   a definition. And once you understand what those are, right? What is a tax? What is an income tax?
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.080]   What is employment tax? What are tax brackets? What are tax rates? What is a wage base, etc.?
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.720]   That's all part of the grammar stage. Then in the logic stage, you can start to deal with the
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:08.240]   arguments of a position, right? People will argue that taxes in the United States are going to go
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.720]   up because the government is running a deficit. People can argue that taxes are going to go down
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.280]   because the government wants to stimulate the economy, etc. And then eventually you can opine
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.520]   yourself on whether somebody should participate in a traditional 401k or a Roth 401k based upon
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:33.040]   their idea of tax brackets, tax rates, wage base, etc. and how those things are likely to be applied
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:40.640]   to you as an individual taxpayer. If you want to help your children to be very smart, I think one
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:48.240]   of the best things you can do is expose them to the grammar or the basics, especially the basic
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:57.200]   definitions of the most important subjects at a very young age. The younger the better. But we
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:04.400]   want to do this in a very thoughtful way. So I use audiobooks as a way of accomplishing this.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   And as an example, I quoted several episodes ago, I quoted extensively from the book Deep Nutrition.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:20.800]   I believe that nutrition is a fundamental topic that all successful human beings need to understand
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:27.600]   in order to fuel their body. And so I want my children to study at a very deep level nutrition.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:34.080]   And so the way that I do that is I have the audiobook version of Deep Nutrition, and when
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:40.960]   we're in the car, about a couple times a week, I'll play about 10 minutes of it. And the children
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.520]   don't have the capacity. Remember, I've got a nine-year-old, seven-year-old, five-year-old,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:50.240]   three-year-old, and newborn. The children don't have the capacity to listen to two hours of it
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.800]   and gain anything meaningful from it. But they do have the capacity to listen to 10 minutes of it.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:03.760]   And the terms, all of the terms of that book start to make them think about nutrition and starts to
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.520]   give them a context for conversations. So then when I guide their nutritional choices, and I say
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.040]   we're going to choose this because this is where the protein value is, this is where the protein is,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:21.120]   or this is where the nutritional value is, etc., then there's a context for that. And I know that
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:26.160]   in the future, as they go forward over the years and they read five more books on nutrition or
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.200]   follow whatever the developments are in their own life, they'll have the ability to understand those
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.880]   topics. Or other things, human relationships, right? We, as a family, I've read it to them
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   before, but now we're doing the audiobook version of How to Win Friends and Influence People.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.320]   I believe this is a fundamental book that really all people should probably read once a year.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.720]   And so I just play a chapter in the car when they can't really do anything else and they kind of
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.920]   have to listen. It's one of those things that doesn't, I have read it at the breakfast table,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.960]   but it's not as interesting as a great story. And so I play it in the car and now we have a context.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.480]   So rule number one, don't criticize, condemn, or complain about other people. And it gives me,
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.760]   it gives us a common family framework to where I can teach them about human relationships.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.160]   Because I believe that one of the basic skills that successful people need, all successful people
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.280]   need, is they need to understand how to handle people, how to deal with people. And so we have a
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.240]   resource that we can then use. Now these are of course adult level books, but children can take
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:33.200]   them in small doses. And I use audiobooks as a convenient way to meter out those doses and I
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.320]   put them in strategically. Now it doesn't have to just be non-fiction. I believe that fiction
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:47.360]   should be the cornerstone for really for most people, but especially for children. I don't know
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.960]   that fiction should be a cornerstone for an adult, but it should definitely be something an adult to
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:58.080]   read. But fiction is really, really important for children. But we can use audiobooks to access
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:04.640]   fiction that is beyond what we ourselves might want to read. So in our family right now, we are
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   nearing the end of book two of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. And we are listening,
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.960]   and have been, it's been a year that we've been working our way through The Hobbit and book one
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.720]   and book two, and we're not done with book two yet, and we'll move on to book three. But we've
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.920]   been, we're working through the Andy Serkis recording that is available of The Lord of the
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:38.880]   Rings. This book is an exquisitely excellent example of fantasy fiction. Very involved and
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:46.640]   intricate plot dynamics, high-level vocabulary, beautiful English construction, exceedingly poetic,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:56.240]   full of interesting plot lines and, you know, betrayal and success and despair and hope and
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:02.080]   courage, etc. And then when you add in Andy Serkis's performance, which just takes it over
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.960]   the top, he's the most gifted voice actor I have ever heard. Incredible. Incredible. I think that
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.720]   listening to The Lord of the Rings, with his production at least, is superior to reading it,
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:22.880]   because it fills in so much beauty to it. And the children love it. But they only love it,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.480]   like, they can't love it three hours at a time work. But 30 minutes here, 45 minutes there,
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.120]   etc. It's wonderful. Reading your way through The Lord of the Rings is a mammoth undertaking
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:40.240]   as a parent, but listening your way through Lord of the Rings is a much less mammoth undertaking.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.240]   And it can be, it'll take you a year to two years probably if you do it, but it's wonderful. And I
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   noticed that the language, so again, pretty high level, right? Definitely high school level
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:01.840]   language in terms of normal Lexile scores, etc. But my children all enjoy it. The five-year-old
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.760]   definitely enjoys it. And his hearing of rich amount of words. So, audiobooks are a way to
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:15.840]   achieve this. Use audiobooks as a tool in your household. And if you'll carefully choose your
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.560]   audiobook selections, and then allow your children to engage with those, in many ways, it'll give you
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:31.200]   a superior option versus other forms of just vegging out. So, remember that the basic concept
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:37.680]   of success in life has to do with opportunity cost. And in every decision, there is an opportunity
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.880]   cost. There's something that is not being done because you've chosen to take the action or make
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.800]   the decision of the thing that you're doing at this moment. Reading or listening to audiobooks
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:55.280]   is not always the best decision. If you tell me to have the choice between a child playing outside
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.200]   several hours per day versus a child not playing outside several hours per day and listening to
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   audiobooks, I'm going to say, "No, we need to play outside." But if you have the choice of
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:11.520]   listening to an audiobook versus consuming a mindless cartoon, the audiobook is a superior
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:18.000]   option. And so, audiobooks also allow you as a parent a tool to give your children a very high
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.600]   quality option for those times when they need entertainment. So, screens in movies and videos
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:33.200]   are very useful. Apps, certain apps can be very useful. But too much of a good thing can turn it
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:41.280]   into a bad thing. And those technologies have certain traps. I want to encourage you that
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:47.840]   many of the times when you are looking for an electronic babysitter for your child,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.520]   if you'll choose an audiobook, it'll fill something in in a powerful way. And then you can do
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:00.880]   multiple things. So, for example, sometimes when the children are wild and crazy and I need them
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:08.080]   calmed down, etc. But maybe I'm busy, my wife's busy, etc. A common tool would be to say, "Let's
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:14.240]   go to a screen." But I think a superior option in many of those cases is everybody come to the
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   kitchen table, we're going to listen to an audiobook, and we're going to draw pictures.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   And so, you have a moment, say, let's have 30 minutes, listen to a high quality audiobook,
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.680]   you're getting words, all the benefits of words, of unique language, really high level language
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:33.920]   that's often not involved in screens or apps, etc. And you're also saying, "Let's practice
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.240]   artistic ability." So, everyone has colored pencils, here's a book on how to draw,
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.160]   practice drawing the shapes, and let's work on artistic ability. And by the way, this also has
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.000]   the benefit of helping strengthen the child's muscles to make writing a less onerous and
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.120]   difficult task, etc., which will help your child's skills in schooling. So, use audiobooks as part of
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.080]   the portfolio. They shouldn't replace reading aloud, but they should be a really valuable tool
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:03.280]   that gives you a more passive experience, but is a superior to many other options.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:11.920]   By the way, I frequently hate on screens and apps and devices. I want to be consistent and say,
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:19.200]   "These are really valuable and wonderful tools, but they can do so much more." So, we use them,
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.240]   I use them, but I want to use them very intentionally, not mindlessly. And by the way,
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.520]   screens and apps and such have benefits in a different application. I'm not going to talk
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:40.400]   about multilingualism in this episode. I think I'll do it in the next episode. But screens can,
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:47.120]   all the downsides of screens, all the downsides of movies can actually become positive things
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.440]   when you move into the world of multilingualism. So, there's a little teaser for the next
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:52:00.640]   discussion on that topic. For this entire episode, I have been talking with you about reading,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:07.840]   but I've been talking about reading with your ears, not with your eyes. This is a fundamental
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:15.440]   step to build fluency that will lead to reading with your eyes. If you want to make your child
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.480]   smarter and help your child to develop his mind, his brain to the highest potential level,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:27.920]   you want your child to be a committed and highly skilled reader with his eyes.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:39.040]   In the same way that the number of words that your child hears will drive his academic success,
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:48.320]   I think the basic metric that you're trying to track and maximize in the development of a child's
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:57.920]   mind is the number of pages read, or the number of words read, either way. A child who has a very
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:07.120]   high page count of reading is a child that is going to be considered and be obviously very,
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:14.080]   very smart, very learned, very educated, regardless of that child's interaction with
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:21.600]   the school system. A child who reads a huge amount will fly through formalized schooling
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.760]   with very little difficulty. That was my experience. I never struggled in school,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:38.080]   ever, primarily because I was a reader. A child who reads a lot can bypass the formalized school
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:46.240]   system and succeed without a problem in almost any field, because the basic skill of education
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:54.400]   or self-education is reading. I don't want to give you a long, drawn-out disquisition on
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:54:03.680]   why this is so. I just want to state it as a blunt fact. It is so. And while many incredible
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:11.040]   technologies can be applied to enhance learning, reading is the fundamental skill.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:19.760]   So how do you teach your child to read and to read well? At its core, I believe the magic tool
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:30.480]   is reading aloud. You want your child to associate books with pleasure, and well-chosen books read to
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:37.120]   the child extensively over time make that link. There are other things that you can do. You want
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.640]   your child to see you reading, modeling the behavior. You want to make sure that your home
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   is full of books. There is good research that…actually, let me go ahead and mention it.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:55.120]   It's important in the context of talking about how to invest in your children. Earlier,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.680]   I mentioned libraries, but a big way to invest in your children is to have books in the home.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.040]   Right now, my home library has a total of
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:16.960]   2,518 titles in it. Right here in our home library. 2,518. I have purchased every one of those books.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.680]   It has not been cheap, and I have thousands of more books that I will be purchasing in the coming
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:28.640]   years. The reason I make this investment is books purchased for your child are some of the cheapest
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.640]   possible money that you could ever spend to help your child do well. Let's talk about the money for
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:39.440]   a moment. No, let's deal with…excuse me. Let me go through the numbers for a moment.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.200]   Reading here from the Read Aloud Handbook by Jim Trelise.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:50.320]   Did you ever notice the similarity between reading scores and rodeo scores? For the sake of
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.720]   discussion, let's say the nation's leaders suddenly decided that rodeo was the most important subject
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.600]   in our school's curriculum. This is not as far-fetched as you might think. If the price of
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.720]   gas keeps rising, some people are going to be looking very differently at horses. There would
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.280]   suddenly be new courses created around horsemanship, saddles and equipment would have to be
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:15.360]   ordered, riding coaches credentialed, and mandatory riding and roping instruction begun in rodeo lab
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:21.200]   classes. All of this would culminate in mandatory grade-level rodeos, including exit rodeos for the
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.800]   high school seniors, to ensure that no rider was left behind and everyone would be racing to the
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.440]   top corral. And sure as the sun sinks in the west, in this scenario, there would be states that
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:39.040]   excelled and those that failed. In fact, to show this idea isn't all that wacky, set your browser
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.840]   for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and look at any of their standings. You'll find the
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:51.200]   high scorers all come from states like Utah, Texas, Nebraska, Oregon, and Colorado, rich with
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.480]   ranches, horses, and cattle. Already we could easily predict which states would be on the
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:02.000]   "failing schools" list for rodeo, places that have the fewest horses, like New Jersey, Illinois,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.920]   Delaware, and Maine. It's tough to get good at rodeo if you're missing a horse, right?
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:12.560]   The same role played by horses in the rodeo world is played by print in the reading world.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.240]   Like Texas or Oregon with rodeo, there are places in America where they annually have the highest
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.520]   reading scores. And in the same country, under the same government, there are homes, schools,
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.960]   and communities that scarcely have seen a new book in decades, and newspapers seldom hit their
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:35.760]   doorstep. It's difficult to get good at reading if you're short of print. Government programs like
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.240]   No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top ensure that children who are behind in reading are
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.600]   entitled to after-school tutoring and extra help with phonics. Nice! But giving phonics lessons to
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.080]   kids who don't have any print in their lives is like giving oars to people who don't have a boat.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:57.280]   You don't get very far. And now here we go into some charts. So here is the verbal results of a
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:03.920]   couple of charts. Number of books in the home of those who have a high interest in books, 80.6.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:09.280]   Number of books in the home who those children who report having a low interest in books, 31.7
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:16.240]   books. Also have a chart of books in the home and average science scores in grade 12. Reported
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:22.880]   number of books at the home, more than 100 books in the home, average science score 161. 26 to 100
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:29.280]   books in the home, average science score 147. 11 to 25 books in the home, average science score
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:39.120]   132. Zero to 10 books in the home, average science score 122. So if you want your child
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:45.680]   to read books, you need to spend money and fill your home with books. Fill your home not just with
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.400]   any books, but fill your home with the best books. Carefully chosen, carefully curated,
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:56.080]   but the best books. And what you will find is if you're doing these things, if you're reading to
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:02.480]   your child and if you have filled your home with books, your children will naturally read books.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.320]   It'll happen. By the way, you'll notice I haven't yet said if you teach them to read or focus on
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:16.720]   phonics or something like that. That stuff's important. But I have, I obviously have a baby,
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.840]   no let me say it, I have three non-reading children who all love books because I have a
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:29.360]   home filled with books and we read books constantly. And so I will routinely say to my
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.440]   children, we have a library in a home, I'll say, you know, it's five o'clock or 5.20, we're getting
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.880]   ready for dinner, have them get their baths, et cetera, go to the library and read. And all of
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.400]   my children, with baby accepted, will go to the library and sit and pleasurably read books for
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:52.960]   30 minutes with no problem, including the non-readers, because books are a source of
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:58.160]   pleasure. And they know that. And of course, they will spend most of their time reading books with
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.000]   beautiful pictures and repeating the stories themselves, books that we've read many times.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.960]   Sometimes they'll basically recite the book, sometimes they read the books to each other,
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:11.120]   et cetera. But you need to have a home filled with books if you want your children to be readers.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.360]   If you'll fill your home with books and then create and make easy access to those books,
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.440]   your children will be able to follow their interests among those books. If you choose
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:29.840]   a broad variety, they can enjoy all of the different things that are available to them.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.240]   You want your children to do well in school? Buy books. Let me give you the math that I think about.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:41.520]   Let's say that you buy a $50 book, a fairly expensive book. If you're in the United States
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.600]   and you can order your books on Amazon, most of your books are going to be $10 to $20,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.920]   in some cases $4. But let's say you buy a $50 book. I buy many $50 books, partly because I do
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.440]   foreign language books, partly because I buy expensive books, et cetera, but I buy a lot of
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:06.560]   $50 books. A $50 book will have at minimum five hours of consumption if it's read. In many cases,
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.640]   it's much, much higher. But let's go with five hours to make easy math and make my point exceedingly
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.880]   conservative. Here's how I think about it. Let's say that I go and I buy a $50 book. I ordered it
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.440]   in from overseas, again, foreign language, out of print, something I'm doing to get a high quality
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:32.080]   book. And I have my first child who reads the book. $10 an hour is my cost for that child to
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:41.200]   read the book. But that $10 per hour is gaining me access to a world-class teacher or tutor on
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:49.840]   that subject. That $10 book is gaining me access to someone who's passionate about a subject.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.960]   The best teachers in the world are available to me for $10 an hour. By the way, notice,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:02.400]   this is a $50 book. In many cases, it's a $10 book. Right now, my eldest child is reading
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.840]   a biography of Marie Curie written by her daughter, Eve Curie. It's an intense book,
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.800]   but he's right there shoulder to shoulder with Pierre and Marie Curie in their laboratory.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.480]   Or a story, right? You're riding across the ocean with a... I mean, I don't mean to go on.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:30.960]   A book gains access to the world's best teacher, somebody who's invested thousands of hours into
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.240]   experience and learning, etc., and is articulating those into five hours. It's incredibly compact.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:44.000]   $10 an hour is an exceedingly cheap price to pay. It's even cheaper if it's $15 for the book and
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.080]   it's $2 an hour. You will never get a better deal for your child's tutoring than a book.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.400]   Then, of course, bring that on to multiple children. I have five children. All five
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.920]   children will read the book. So now my per hour consumption cost drops to $2 an hour,
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.560]   spread out across. And by the way, many books, they'll put in 30 hours' width,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.600]   50 hours' width. The hours just grow and grow. When I was a child, I used to love reading
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.320]   encyclopedias. And so I bought a lot of encyclopedias. Dorling Kindersley at DK is a
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.080]   publisher that produces these incredible encyclopedias. Fill your home with encyclopedias.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.080]   Your children will read them if they're readers. And so you're getting the best access to
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:32.720]   scientific information, historical information, all the stuff. And your children will go again
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.240]   and again and read those again and again and again, following their interests. So you're not
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.720]   going to get something better that you can spend your money on that will improve your children's
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:50.480]   outcomes, academics, test scores, etc. than books. Get good lists, buy good books, always buy your
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.440]   children the best books that you can afford. Fill your home with them and then give them ample time
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.800]   to read them. Why am I so passionate about the idea of investing in your children when they're
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.280]   young? It's because there's a whole bunch of parents that start to freak out when their 9th
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.480]   grader gets bad test scores. And they'll go out and they'll spend $30 an hour, $40 an hour,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.040]   or more to try to bring in a tutor. And that tutor has dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:23.600]   dozens of hours to put in to try to make up for where the child is behind. There should be no
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.040]   need for it. You should be able to hand your child a book and say, "This book has the information you
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.120]   need for what you're struggling with." But if your child is not a reader, that's going to fail.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.400]   So put in the investment when your children are young and make sure that they become skilled,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:50.640]   fluent, competent readers who love to read and who read very widely. And you will never have a need
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.240]   to pay for a tutor. You'll have a child who is at the top of his class in academics. You'll have a
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:03.120]   child who you never need to pay for a tutor because you did the hard work in the early years.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.960]   If you want to develop your child's brain, your child needs words. Those words should be heard
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.520]   and those words should be read. And the child who has huge portions of his life dedicated to
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:24.880]   listening to the best words, the most beautifully presented words, the most advanced and appropriate
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:31.920]   words, and who reads those for years and years and years, will have the most highly developed
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.120]   mind among his peers. But what's more important than that, will have established the foundation
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:45.120]   for what he needs to go on and be impactful as an adult. Consider how you can use these
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:51.360]   very simple techniques to help your children have more words. Technique one, reading aloud. Get a
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:58.160]   book list, get books. Read to your child, set a target of two hours a day. Remember that as with
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:08.320]   most things, the numbers that are used by people are laughable. I read this, I saved this infographic
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.160]   a number of years ago, came across, and here it is by Scholastic. And here's what the infographic
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.640]   or the little chart says. Here's the impact of reading 20 minutes per day. It says, "A student
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:24.320]   who reads one minute per day will be exposed to 8,000 words per year and is more likely to score
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.080]   in the 10th percentile on standardized tests. A student who reads five minutes per day will be
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:37.120]   exposed to 282,000 words per year and is more likely to score in the 50th percentile on standardized
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:43.920]   tests. A student who reads 20 minutes per day will be exposed to 1.8 million words per year
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:50.960]   and is more likely to score in the 90th percentile on standardized tests." So reading 20 minutes per
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:57.840]   day puts your child with a high likelihood of being in the 90th percentile. Reading 20 minutes
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:06.560]   per day, friend, is laughable, or to use the literary term, risible, right? It's risible. It's
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:14.400]   utterly, it's absurd. If reading 20 minutes per day makes it likely that your child will be in
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:24.080]   the 90th percentile of academic outcomes, what does reading two hours a day do? What does reading
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:31.920]   five hours a day do? What does reading six or eight hours a day do? There's an element where
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.280]   we need to be careful about age appropriateness, but I think for most school-age children, say,
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:44.080]   third grade and on, the norm should be about five to eight hours a day of total reading
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.360]   divided up, as I have described it, with reading aloud, audiobooks, and then personalized reading.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:57.200]   If you do two hours a day of reading aloud plus one to two hours a day of personal audiobook
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.000]   listening, let's just call it two hours a day for easy math, plus about four to five hours a day of
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.560]   focused academics, let's call it eight hours a day, that's actually not that much in terms of
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:14.640]   children having lots of time to play, lots of time to move, etc. Lots of times to do all kinds of
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.760]   other stuff. In some cases there'll be free reading on top of that, but let's just assume an
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.800]   average reading speed of 8,000 words per hour, about the rate of normal verbal spoken, right?
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.120]   Of course, a child who's a skilled reader will be reading far faster than that when reading silently,
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:40.960]   but assume 8,000 words per hour times eight hours per day is 64,000 words per day of reading.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.880]   That seems pretty normal to me. Probably to most homeschoolers I know, I would say that's
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.400]   pretty normal, right? Four hours of academics. Maybe we should dial it back because at least
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.800]   an hour or two of that academics is going to be math, which isn't reading words. So let's just
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.880]   cut it back to 48,000 words per day, okay? 48,000 words per day and let's say that that happens
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.520]   300 days per year, that's 14.4 million words. Compare that to the scholastic chart of a child
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:17.440]   reading 1.8 million words and you can quickly see the difference. Reading 10 to 20 million words a
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:27.360]   year is probably a pretty average year for, I think, most average children who are given the
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.840]   freedom, the books, the encouragement, the example. Children have people read to them,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.480]   all these preconditions, but this seems pretty normal to me.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.640]   I want to add one more technique if you're working to help your child be a skilled reader.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:51.440]   Don't, or be quick to use the benefit of your child listening to an audiobook of the exact
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.160]   book that he's reading so he can hear someone read it to him while he's reading with his eyes.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.920]   This is a technique that I figured out as being exceedingly useful in foreign language acquisition
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:10.400]   and my seven-year-old, my seven-year-old daughter was having some trouble learning to read. There
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.000]   was a time where my wife and I were focusing a lot, say, "Okay, is she dyslexic? What's going on
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.920]   here?" Etc. And since then we've made a lot of progress, but we were really focusing on,
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:28.000]   she was slower to read, what was going on, what was happening. And we made good progress,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.040]   just continued to work with her, and again, people develop at their own stage. She still flips a lot
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.680]   of stuff. I don't know if she's dyslexic or not. I don't think she is, but it's not severe like
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:44.080]   some parents struggle with. But one of the techniques that I've watched that was so powerful
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.600]   was this technique of listening to books while having them read to you. And this is a skill that
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.040]   you can help your child to do much larger amounts of reading, but to be helped along. Again, I've
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.120]   experienced this myself and realized how helpful it is. I've been talking to my wife a lot. I was
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.280]   like, "We should use this more just in our own language," and we do use it a lot now.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.240]   If a child is struggling with a difficult book that is advanced, add in an audiobook and have
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.040]   the child listen to the audiobook while reading with his eyes. And that will help the child to
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:22.240]   become a skillful reader. My experience has been this. There's a stage at which reading is a lot
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:28.640]   of work, and you just want to make it simple with lots and lots of easy reading stacked up,
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   lots of easy reading. Then reading becomes doable, but it's still a lot of work. Audiobooks help the
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.000]   child to pass over that hurdle, listening while reading. And then there comes a stage where the
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.480]   reading is so effortless that the audiobooks annoy the student because they're too slow.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:50.080]   So at that point, dump the audiobooks and just allow the book to shine itself. If you want to
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.440]   develop your children's minds to their highest potential capacity, you want your children to be
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:04.160]   smart. There is no substitute for there being very strong readers. Your best possible investment
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:12.000]   is to make sure that your children are good readers and love to read. The way you do that,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.480]   read to them a lot. Aim for two hours a day, add audiobooks whenever possible of the highest
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:24.400]   quality books. Let them see you reading. Help them with a phonics instruction program, appropriate.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.280]   Help them with lots and lots of readers, lots and lots of practice, and then make sure they have
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.640]   lots of books surrounding them and lots of time to read those books. And if you do that,
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:42.000]   you will never need to pay for college. You will never need to pay for expensive tutors.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.160]   A few thousand dollars spent early in the child's life will save you hundreds of thousands of
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.960]   dollars later in life. Thank you for listening. Be back with you very soon.
