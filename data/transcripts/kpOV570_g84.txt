[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Another big week ahead of us on the podcast.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.720]   Our inbox is rather full of questions from listeners who are asking about remarriage
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.800]   after the death of a spouse.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.960]   Here are two of those emails.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.540]   "Pastor John, my name is Preeti, P-R-E-E-T-Y, Preeti from Indonesia.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.800]   In July of last year, I lost my loving husband.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000]   He went in for surgery that was not supposed to be life-threatening, but he never woke
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800]   up from the anesthesia.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   I was and remain in shock.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.760]   We have been married for 8 years, blessed with two beautiful daughters.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.840]   My husband has been actively serving the Lord since the age of 18, while most of his friends
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.080]   are Hindu.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.960]   His life was all about the gospel.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.280]   We started a church and a few gatherings.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.740]   He loved people dearly, compassionate and generous.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.760]   My question to you is this, are there verses in the Bible that encourage widows to remarry?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.600]   That sounds disturbing to me right now.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.360]   My question is, what's left for me to hold on to in my relationship between my husband
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.360]   and me?
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.640]   I long to be always called his wife, but is that wrong?
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.080]   Each day I wait to be reunited with my husband again.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.600]   Thank you, Pastor John."
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.640]   And then the second email comes in from Patricia, who asks more directly, "Pastor John, does
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   the Bible allow remarriage after the death of a spouse?"
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.480]   What would you say to these ladies, Pastor John?
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.960]   Well, this is really fresh, it sounds like, and very present in the heart of Preeti.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:41.320]   I don't know Patricia's situation, but let me start with principles and then get to the
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.520]   point of Preeti's heart and the decision she's facing.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.280]   Marrying after the death of a spouse is pretty clearly addressed by Paul at least twice,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.540]   and by Jesus as well.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.280]   In Romans 7, verses 2 and 3, Paul says this, "A married woman is bound by law to her husband
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.960]   while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage."
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   So there's the first statement.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.880]   "Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.360]   is alive, but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, and if she marries another
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.880]   man, she's not an adulteress."
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.640]   So twice, verse 2, "If her husband dies, she's released."
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.680]   Verse 3, "If her husband dies, she's free."
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.440]   Then Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7.39, "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.640]   but if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes only in the Lord."
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.360]   So Paul simply adds to what he taught in Romans that any marriage of a believer should be
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.880]   in the Lord, that is, to another believer.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.600]   Now Jesus addressed the issue because the Sadducees, who didn't believe in the resurrection,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.040]   tried to make remarriage look foolish.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.280]   It looked like it produced polygamy in heaven.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.160]   That was their shtick on why heaven can't really exist, because we'd be polygamous there
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   because of all the people that have married again after the death of a spouse.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.260]   So they pointed to the Old Testament provision that a brother is to marry the widow of his
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.000]   brother, raise up offspring, and they say that happened, and it happened seven times,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400]   so now she's had seven husbands.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   So with a sneer, whose wife is she going to be in the resurrection?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.760]   So what did Jesus say?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.200]   Did he say, "Oh, well, I guess she shouldn't remarry because we certainly can't have polygamy
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   in the heaven."
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.560]   No, that's not what he said.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   He said, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are counted
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.160]   worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry or are given in
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   marriage, for they cannot die anymore because they are equal to angels and are sons of God
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   being sons of the resurrection."
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.520]   That's Luke 20, 33-36.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.160]   In other words, a widow does not need to worry about polygamy in heaven when she remarries
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.140]   because relationships are going to be so different in the resurrection, no one will think of
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.000]   marriage in a way that makes polygamy a problem.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.080]   It's just not going to be there.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.320]   There won't be marriage and giving in marriage like there are here and now.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:15.000]   So at the principal level, widows and widowers are free to marry in the Lord.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.160]   Now just a word about Preeti's situation.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:28.420]   She says, "My question is, are there verses in the Bible that encourage widows to remarry?"
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.200]   And the answer is, yes, there are.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.680]   Like 1 Timothy 5, 11-15, where Paul wants younger widows to remarry instead of being
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.940]   on the special widow care ministry that existed evidently so that they wouldn't be a burden
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.660]   on the church and so that they wouldn't be a victim of Satan's temptation.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.620]   But I would caution to say that what Paul means there is command to marry because of
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.460]   1 Corinthians 7-39 where it says they are free to remarry whom they please only in the
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.460]   Lord.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:13.180]   It's not as though Paul is, I think, providing an absolute here that every widow must remarry
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.780]   any more than every person must marry in the first place.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.180]   Now she adds, "Okay, that encouragement or positive view of remarriage sounds disturbing
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.060]   to me right now.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:33.300]   My question," she says, "is what's left for me to hold on to in my relationship with
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.060]   my husband and me?
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.580]   I long to always be called his wife.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.720]   But is that wrong?"
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:51.620]   Now my response, Preeti, is even if you remarry someday, which you feel right now is remote,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:07:00.540]   if you do remarry someday, you may respectfully be known as the former wife of your previous
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.680]   husband.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.420]   He had no other.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.060]   You were his.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.980]   That fact never changes.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.060]   And that would only be a problem to be known that way if your emotional bond with your
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.580]   deceased husband was stronger than your emotional bond with your second husband.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:28.960]   But I would encourage you not to make any commitment not to remarry, and I would encourage
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.460]   you not to feel any pressure to rush into any remarriage or to exclude the possibility
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.300]   of remarriage.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:47.340]   Time heals the deepest wounds, especially for believers like you who have had such sweet
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.500]   and good experiences that have been lost.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.340]   Time heals the deepest wounds.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:59.940]   Let time pass, and let God show you over time what the future holds.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.060]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the questions as well.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.860]   As you can hear, we're working through some audio issues on Pastor John's side of things,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.020]   and we hope to get those resolved soon.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.540]   So thank you for your patience.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.340]   You can, of course, subscribe to our audio feeds and search our episode archive and even
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.540]   reach us by email with a difficult question that you may be facing in your life.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:25.620]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.700]   Well how much sleep is laziness and how little sleep is arrogance?
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.580]   And when should we deprive ourselves of sleep and how do we find the balance in our sleep
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   patterns?
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.420]   We all face this question every day really and it's a question on the table and we return
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.420]   on Wednesday.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.140]   And for those listeners in the United States, have a wonderful Independence Day celebration.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.300]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.620]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
