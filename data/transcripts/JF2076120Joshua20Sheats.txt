[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.500]   and then perhaps clearing all the leverage on their portfolio.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000]   Best ever listeners, before we get into today's episode,

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000]   oh, by the way, happy Sunday, best ever listeners.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Today is Sunday, so we're doing a special segment called Skill Set Sunday
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500]   where you're going to come away with a specific skill.

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Very well, sir. Thank you for having me on.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, nice to have you on the show, my friend.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.500]   And the skill that we're going to talk about, well, you know what?
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'm going to talk a little bit about his background first, then we'll talk about the skill.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.500]   Joshua is the host of Radical Personal Finance Podcast,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.000]   which teaches how to achieve financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He's a financial planner that mixes creative approaches,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   deep dive financial planning techniques, and business strategy.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500]   He's based in sunny West Palm Beach, Florida,
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   and you can say hi to him at his website, RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   And what we're going to come away with today is a broad understanding
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.000]   of how personal finance and professional financial techniques are interrelated
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.500]   and why you need both.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.000]   With that being said, Joshua, you want to give the best ever listeners
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.500]   a little bit more about your background and what you're focused on?
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.000]   Absolutely. I come from a long background of being interested in personal finance
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500]   and kind of the wealth building world.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000]   And then I spent six years working as a professional financial planner.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.500]   I'm a certified financial planner, chartered life underwriter,
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.000]   I have a master's degree in financial planning, etc.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So I dug deep into the world of technical financial planning
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.500]   and out of frustration for the fact that people usually disconnect these worlds,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.000]   the world of technical professional financial planning techniques
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and the world of what I call personal finance,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   which real estate would be a component of the world of personal finance.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   People often disconnect them, and I look at them coming from both backgrounds
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and said they should be fully and completely integrated.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.500]   They're not opposed to one another. They should be working together.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   And so a couple of years ago I decided that I was going to be the one to cross that bridge.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.000]   So I closed my financial planning firm and I launched Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.500]   And for the last over two years I've been working very, very diligently
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   to try to cross that bridge for people.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   Well, let's start first with some definitions.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   So can you define personal finance and can you define professional finance?
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   I would define very loosely personal finance as all of the stuff that you do toward money.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.000]   And so the advice under personal finance, to give some examples,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.500]   would be things like don't buy a latte every day and the famous latte factor.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   Save that money.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   The advice would be something like invest in real estate.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000]   The advice would be something like get out of debt.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The advice would be something like fund your 401(k).
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   These are all the things that you do that are commonly heralded in financial periodicals
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and financial shows as things that you should do.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.500]   Now the world of technical financial planning is the specifics.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.000]   Okay, if you're going to buy a piece of real estate,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.500]   should you purchase it within a trust or within a business entity?
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   If you're going to invest into a retirement account,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   should you use a solo 401(k) or a SEP IRA?
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.000]   Or should you establish a defined benefit pension program for your company?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Or if you're going to buy life insurance, should you buy term life insurance
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   or universal life insurance or whole life insurance, etc.?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so usually these two things are sold in very different ways.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Personal financial advice, especially with something like real estate,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.500]   is usually sold through the form of a motivational seminar.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   Something like you can get rich if you just buy rental properties
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   and you can purchase it with no money down
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.000]   or whatever the latest thing is that's being focused on
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500]   at the various cycles of the real estate market.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.000]   And so these types of seminars are very influential.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.500]   This type of education is very influential.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.000]   But what happens is, as happened to me when I was a financial advisor,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.500]   a real estate investor might be sitting there saying,
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   "Well, as I look at my situation, I'm just going to go buy more real estate.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   And that's going to fix all of my financial problems.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   I don't need to worry about a budget. I'll just go buy more rental properties."
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.000]   I had a client that was like this. He had 70 or 80 rental properties.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.500]   He was always broke and he kept trying to fix the fact that he was broke
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.000]   by going and buying more properties and doing more deals.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.500]   Now, that's what often happens if you don't value the technical financial advice.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   On the flip side, the danger is that you spend so much time
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.000]   on the technical financial advice that you don't get any of the motivation
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.500]   or don't get any of the practice.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   Somebody's worrying about how to optimize the asset allocation
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   in their retirement account when in reality they should be out
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   walking neighborhoods or cruising Craigslist and trying to put in offers on houses.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.000]   And so these two things need to be fully together because you need both
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   in order to be successful financially long term.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So how do we think about this? What's the approach that we should take?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Well, good financial planning always starts with goals.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.500]   And you should always build from specific stated goals,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   which are goals that are for you.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   So trying to stay focused with the real estate bent here
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   to help your audience with the most.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.000]   Real estate should be just simply a funding mechanism for life.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Oftentimes when you ask people how much real estate they want to own,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they'll throw out some round number.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.500]   I want to own 10 rental houses or I want to own $5 million worth of property
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.000]   or 25 houses or things like this.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I always ask people why?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.500]   What are you going to pay for with those properties?
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   Usually these numbers in my experience come from reading a motivating book,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   hearing a motivating speaker who talks about how rich they are
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   and how much great things that they can buy.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   But many people never sit down and say, "Well, what do I actually need?"
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   So the median household income in the United States of America
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   is somewhere in the $40,000 range.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   You could hit $40,000 a year of net profit from, depending on your market,
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.000]   something like four rental houses, maybe five rental houses,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   once those houses are debt-free.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.500]   And so what happens is because people aren't actually sitting down
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.000]   and looking at their budget and figuring out how much money they need
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.500]   and then making a plan to meet that with their investment strategy,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.000]   to meet that with a specific number of houses,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.500]   they wind up pursuing either an inefficient plan or a risky plan.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.000]   Just using my very simple example,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   many of your listeners will want to spend more money.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I'm not saying there's anything wrong with spending more money
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   or trying to accumulate a bigger portfolio.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   But the quicker you can get to a place of financial stability
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.500]   and the lower your goals are, the easier it is to get there with less risk.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   So many people would be well-served by taking a look at their expenses.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.500]   Say there's something like $4,000 a month,
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.000]   which is median in the United States of America.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.500]   You can live a great lifestyle on $4,000 a month.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500]   Many people would be well-served by getting to that number first
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   and then perhaps pursuing aggressively,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500]   clearing all the leverage on their portfolio,
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.500]   so that they have total safety.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   So that no matter what the market cycle is,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.000]   no matter what the market condition is,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.500]   they can actually maintain that lifestyle.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   And I could point to scads of real estate investors
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.500]   who've learned this the hard way.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.000]   That will probably serve as a better foundation for a lifetime of wealth
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   than just trying to pursue the big fancy-sounding personal finance goal
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.500]   of I own 25 properties,
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.000]   and then perhaps making a mistake with the buy,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   structuring the financing unwisely,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and winding up losing it all and having to start again.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So there should be a combination of good technical financial planning techniques,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.500]   clear goals, and what unites them is having a clear goal
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   and then using different funding mechanisms for those goals.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   Yeah, I completely agree because so often
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   I've had over 700, 800 interviews on this podcast
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   and I've had the privilege of interviewing people
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   who have gone through 2008 and lost it all and are rebuilding.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   And the way they're rebuilding is that they are not leveraging
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   nearly as much as what they were,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.000]   and they have cash on hand for when the next market correction happens.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.500]   And that's basically what you're saying,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.000]   where you identify what your goal is,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and you then look to see what type of leverage you have in your portfolio,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.500]   clear out the leverage, meaning the debt,
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   and then you've got the cash flow on hand
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.000]   regardless of what the market happens, right?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.500]   To add to what you said,
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.000]   the idea behind taking an approach is to recognize
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.500]   owning real estate is not an end in and of itself.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   It's a means to an end.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so as soon as you have that goal achieved,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   you should be working to stabilize it
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.500]   because it's far better to achieve a basic goal,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   stabilize, and then move on from a place of strength
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.000]   than it is to always be stretching out your hand for something more and more and more and more.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Real estate is a fine investment class.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It has created many, many, many wealthy people,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.500]   but it also has its own problems.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.000]   And so without focusing on something like good financing and minimization of financing,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.500]   you wind up stretching too far,
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.000]   market cycle changes,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.500]   immature investor,
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   and they have to start all over again.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   Another example of the parallel is in technical financial planning,
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500]   we spend a lot of time focusing on asset allocation plans and diversification.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   My experience has been that real estate investors,
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   at least the ones that I've personally interacted with,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:02.000]   have a tendency to discount the value of asset allocation planning, of diversification.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.500]   Usually, in order to do well in real estate,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   people find one area of specialty that they do really well with,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   whatever their business strategy is.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.000]   And they focus on that area of specialty to the exclusion of other things,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.500]   whether that means they only invest in real estate,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   they don't invest in anything else,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.000]   that means they don't own publicly traded securities,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.500]   they don't own bonds,
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   they don't own gold or silver coins,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   they don't have bank accounts with cash in them,
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.000]   everything's going to be in real estate.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Or if it means they exclusively focus on a very small specialty type of real estate investing,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and they wind up with a very concentrated portfolio.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.500]   Well, a good financial planner is going to look at that and say,
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.000]   "You've got a lot of risk here.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.500]   So what can we do in your situation to diversify your risk?"
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.500]   And so at different stages of a real estate investor's life cycle,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   they need to consider very carefully how to diversify their risks
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.000]   and what forms of risks they're diversifying from.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   There's a risk of being very focused on one specific neighborhood
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   or one specific type of real estate.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.500]   So you always want to balance the fact that your best deals are going to come
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.000]   when you're a market specialist.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So therefore, yes, specializing one neighborhood is a good plan to start with.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500]   But things can happen beyond your control.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.000]   So as you're building wealth,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.500]   it's good to diversify out of real estate into other investment classes that are helpful to you.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   Diversify out of one neighborhood or one particular type of real estate
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.000]   so that you can have more safety in your overall portfolio.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Do you invest in real estate?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I have invested in real estate in the form of my own personal property.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I don't currently own any rental properties.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.500]   And why have you chosen not to do that?
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.000]   Because a couple of things.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I do intend to.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.500]   In fact, I'm very carefully--
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.000]   I know the specific neighborhoods.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.500]   I know the specific real estate strategy.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   I've researched it extensively as far as I've chosen the strategies that will work the best for me.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   But for a couple of reasons, in my local area, I'm currently waiting.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   Number one is I'm watching the market in my area.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.000]   And the particular type of real estate strategy that I desire to build,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   which is very much on the model of what John Schaub teaches--
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   single-family houses, 322s, middle-class neighborhoods--
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   this particular market is not at an excellent bargain price.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Doesn't mean there aren't bargains available.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.500]   It's not an excellent bargain price as an asset class.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   Number two is that my best form of opportunity right now is in the form of my business.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:28.000]   So my business is completely unconstrained from the potential investment returns of an asset class like real estate,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.500]   where the growth of the value of the market is going to be dependent upon the underlying incomes locally.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.500]   My business is an infinitely leverageable business.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.500]   I run a virtual internet business.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.000]   I've been building it for two years.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And there's no physical factor that constrain the growth.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And there are some key places that I'm focusing on investing my money, my savings money, into that business
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   to gain the investment growth from that business.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And so right now, I can make--I believe, I'm in the process of proving--
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I can make a much higher return from my business activities than from my real estate activities.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.500]   So my current plan where I am, as we record this here in September 2016,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   is I'm focusing heavily on my business right now, and then I'm stockpiling cash.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   And that cash forms an excellent foundation for my business stability,
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.000]   and it also will form the foundation that I need to be able to find good properties here in my local area.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.500]   And so I'm looking at real estate investing not as a primary source of cash generation,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   but as an excellent source of me parking some of my investment dollars.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   So I'm watching the local market, keeping an eye, and then my own personal gut on my local real estate market
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.000]   is a couple years from now, we're going to have a lot more deals available than today.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And so I will be in a position where a couple years from now,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'll be ready to go ahead and transfer some of my cash into property.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.500]   What's something that is a mistake that you see commonly repeated among real estate investors?
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   You mentioned the lack of diversification, but is there something else that you see?
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.500]   Probably the biggest thing is not doing enough research on different ideas and different plans.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   Many people who get into real estate get in through the form of some sort of real estate seminar,
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.000]   a real estate book, and those things are great.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I learned a lot in my younger year.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I first got interested in real estate through a real estate seminar by one of the shysters
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   who is now bankrupt and out of business, thankfully.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And I was a hair's breadth away from maxing out my credit cards to buy the $30,000 consulting package
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   that was going to make me rich in no time.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And I watched a few of my friends who went in, I watched a few of my friends go completely bankrupt in 2008.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   So I'm thankful I was saved from that.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But I spent years thinking that there was only one real estate strategy.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.500]   And then when I was digging into it much more deeply and starting to study,
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   I realized that no, that's not the case.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   There are many real estate strategies.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   And there are many types of businesses, many types of approaches to investing.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   I had a number of very wealthy real estate investors who were clients of mine.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   As I interacted with them, I realized that one thing they had done is they had found a style of real estate investing
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   that suited their personality, that suited the type of business that they wanted to build.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:09.000]   And real estate businesses are now still on my backup list of businesses that if my current business were to fail,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I would consider building some sort of real estate investment business.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But there are so many different types that you could build.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And most people don't do any research.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It's like they won't spend $100 or $200 on some really good books and read them
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   in order to educate themselves on different opportunities.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And then think to themselves, "Ah, new construction. That would actually fit me really well."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Or buying single family houses or commercial real estate or tax deeds.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It just usually goes based upon whatever the latest newsletter I bought was that I found was interesting.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I recommend do a survey of the marketplace and go and meet investors.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Go and ride along with them and go and find them.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And then understand the business models.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.500]   Understand what your source of capital is.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.000]   Where are you going to get investment capital if you're starting with nothing?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Where is the profit point in a deal?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Where do you actually get your profit from and your cash flow?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And then based upon your situation, you'll know how to approach investment.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   It's different if you just got out of high school and you don't have any money but you have a lot of time.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You can build a real estate business with no money and a lot of time.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   But it's going to be different than the guy who's 55 years old who has a massive income from his job or business
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   and he's just parking some money in real estate as a component of his investment portfolio.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Those would be two very different activities.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Is there anything else that we haven't talked about as it relates to personal finance
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and professional finance techniques and them being interrelated and real estate investors that you want to mention?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   I would say buy good advice.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I want to be careful about not generalizing too much.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But you always want to buy good advice.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Buy good professional advice.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And especially in the areas of financial planning, knowing the best way to structure a transaction,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   knowing the best way to structure your financing, knowing the best way to structure your ownership.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   If you buy good advice, especially with technical financial planning, it can have a massive potential impact.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And I'm not lobbying for any one specific thing.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   But what happens is there can be a tendency among a subset of real estate investors to be very, very proud,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   and rightly so, of the skill that they have in putting deals together.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And then to automatically dismiss those of us who were technical experts in a particular area,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   putting the transaction together, putting the financing together.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And you want to be careful there. Both are important.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   No, the technical expert is usually often not a rainmaker.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   But you want them on your team, and you want to take the time to absorb and study good advice
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   because the profits are usually found at the margin.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   So in real estate, number one, fundamental economic principle is that change always occurs at the margin.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That's where changes occur. It doesn't occur in the middle. It always occurs at the margin.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And so a lot of your wins in a deal are found at the margin.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   If you go into a property and you sit down and you're up against another investor,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and if that other investor is just simply looking at that property in the most basic form,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   they might have a rate of return that they're estimating from that deal of X percent.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But if you go into that and you know that I can make a slight tweak here with my financing,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I can make a slight tweak here and cut costs in this thing here,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and I can make a slight tweak here with my sales process,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and if you understand the full process, you might be able with your return to get X plus an extra 30 percent.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Well, you do that systematically over the course of a career, and that X plus 30 percent makes a huge difference.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So if you look at what seems like small differences in individual deals when they're accumulated
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and compounded over a lifetime, it makes a huge difference in your total level of wealth.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   What's the best place the best ever listeners can reach you?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   If you're interested in listening to my show, Radical Personal Finance,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   just search the App Store on your phone for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   That's the best thing to do.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I've got almost 400 episodes there, in-depth financial content.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We cover everything from how to live in your car to complicated financial planning,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   how to structure trusts and how to set up and understand estate planning, give the basics.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   And none of it will substitute for good personal advice,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   but what I tell my listeners is you'll be well-equipped to actually understand the terminology
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and understand where some of the loopholes are so that you can get good personal advice applied to your situation.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I've been taking notes along the way.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I already mentioned what we talked about earlier, and that was the goal and the plan and clearing the leverage.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   But a couple of other things that I wrote down while you were talking I think is just something really insightful
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and that we all as real estate investors need to own this philosophy,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and that is owning real estate is a means to an end.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And I've always said that about fixing and flipping and wholesaling because it's just a transaction.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's not a long-term strategy.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It's basically a job where you get income, and then you need to do something with that income.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   But I also need to look in the mirror and look at my business model where I buy apartments with investors
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and share in the profits, but usually we have a five-year exit strategy.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   So really what I'm doing is also very similar to fix and flipping, just on a different level.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And I think there's a lot of ways that that philosophy can be applied.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So make sure that we realize that this is a means to an end with the end being the goal that we have stated
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   for what we are trying to accomplish financially.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And then the other thing that you mentioned that I thought was really interesting for real estate investors in particular
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   is there is thick irony in that as real estate investors, in order to be successful,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   we have to specialize and be very good at one thing.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   But hey, guess what?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   101, personal finance, you've got to diversify and make sure that you're covered
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   should something happen to that one thing that you're doing.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And that's something that we've got to keep in mind specifically and tactically.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Maybe it's different markets.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Maybe it's making sure we have multiple exit strategies.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   There's a lot of different ways we can look at that.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But just opening up the topic of conversation is important for the best ever listeners and myself included
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   so that we can begin or continue to self-assess how we're approaching real estate investing
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   and how we're approaching our personal finances.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   So really grateful that you talked through that and grateful that you're on the show, Joshua.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Thank you so much.
