[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   What does real financial freedom actually look like?
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.520]   Is it unlimited choices or is it something else entirely?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   Today, I'm sitting down with my friend Grant Sabatier,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.120]   best-selling author of Financial Freedom
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.460]   and the Inner Entrepreneur,
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.600]   to explore how our definition of freedom evolves
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.820]   as we build our wealth.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.280]   But there's a catch, and as Grant says,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.740]   So the older that I've gotten,
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.460]   I've realized that freedom really actually
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.820]   only exists within limits.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.720]   We are going to get really tactical
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.020]   about achieving that freedom,
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.460]   including how to set limits,
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.940]   balance financial independence with personal happiness,
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.200]   and we'll even debate whether entrepreneurship
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.120]   might be a key part of this equation.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760]   And if you've ever wondered how to define enough
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.980]   and how to create a life you truly love,
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.580]   I really think you'll like this one.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and if you enjoy this episode,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.480]   please consider sharing it with a friend
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.940]   or leave a comment or review.

[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.760]   Grant, you have talked a lot about money in your life,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.240]   but what does freedom actually look like to you?
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.980]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.640]   So my definition of freedom has definitely changed
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.040]   as I've gotten older.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.780]   When I was younger and I was broke
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.640]   and I didn't have any money,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.060]   freedom just simply meant having enough time
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.720]   to do whatever I wanted with my life,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.360]   not being limited by money,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.100]   being able to live the fullest life that I could
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.660]   without being restricted.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.800]   So it was this limitless idea.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.300]   And that really was my thinking
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300]   when I started my financial independence journey.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.260]   I just need the money to get out.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.540]   I just need some space.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.940]   I just don't ever wanna be constricted.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.180]   I don't wanna limit what my family can do.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.940]   I don't wanna limit what I can do.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.980]   I wanna make the most of this one life.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.540]   But interestingly, as I acquired more money,
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.640]   I started to change my definition of freedom.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.620]   And I realized that freedom
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.700]   really wasn't about unlimited choices.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.100]   It was just about having the ability
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.940]   to do what you love when you want to do it.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.540]   And those are two different things.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.920]   So for me, I really struggled with this idea
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.780]   of how am I gonna spend my time
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.040]   when I reach financial independence?
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.220]   What am I gonna do?
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.540]   And I realized that I needed to create
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.920]   some limits in my life.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.540]   So the older that I've gotten,
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.240]   I've realized that freedom really actually
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.620]   only exists within limits.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.540]   And we obviously have the natural limit
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.060]   of death in our lives
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.880]   and we don't know how long we're gonna be here.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.060]   And so how we spend our time is really important
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.140]   and it really matters.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760]   But we're just constantly under siege for our attention.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.700]   There's just so many things distracting us.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.400]   And especially when you have a little bit of money,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.440]   when you're successful, when you have a big community,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.240]   there's so many people that wanna do things with you,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   so many opportunities that it becomes really important
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.880]   to construct your own filters for your life.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.320]   And this was a hard lesson for me to learn
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.260]   because I just tried to do everything all the time
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.140]   and ended up not only getting burnt out,
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.700]   but just really kind of distancing myself
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.240]   from a lot of the people that I love.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.100]   But once I realized that, hey,
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.600]   I can control and create my own space of freedom
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.640]   that ultimately allowed me to create more freedom in my life
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.480]   and has led me to a life that I really love
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.980]   with a by-product being,
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.920]   I have a fair amount of peace in my life
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.620]   just because all the things that I don't care about,
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800]   those opportunities, those distractions,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.220]   no longer show up.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.580]   But what about you?
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.560]   How's your thinking of freedom changed?
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.060]   Yeah, I mean, I think when I started,
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.900]   freedom was I just, like you said,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.080]   you know, you wanna be able to do anything,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.660]   go anywhere.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.840]   And then thinking about that pursuit can lead you
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.540]   to feel like you just need unlimited money, right?
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.040]   It's just like, how do you make more and make more?
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.780]   And then you realize, I don't need everything.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.080]   Like, I'm very happy with the life we have.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   And so I think you mentioned limits
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.340]   and you talked about them
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.000]   in the constraint of demands on your time.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.980]   I think this year, my wife, Amy, and I had talked about,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.360]   let's make sure that we're in charge of what we wanna do.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.920]   Just because someone invites us to do something
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.220]   doesn't mean we have to say yes.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.880]   Just because someone sends you an email
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   doesn't mean you have to reply.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.240]   And so there's limits on your time,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.540]   but are there other kind of limits you put in place?
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.800]   Yeah, so think about your life as a space of freedom.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.560]   It's a container.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.800]   And around that container are all the ways
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.520]   in which you spend your time,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.880]   from what you eat to where you travel
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.240]   to how you spend your money
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.460]   to the content that you ultimately consume.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.100]   We're naturally a balance between our inputs
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.500]   and our outputs.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.800]   And there's times in life when you wanna create,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.780]   there's times in life when you wanna consume.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.220]   And I think it's really important
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760]   to take some time to think through
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.540]   not only what does an ideal day look like,
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.800]   what does, you know, you want your life to look like,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.920]   and then build a space around that.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.660]   This goes beyond just saying no to things
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.300]   and really helps you ultimately construct limits
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.440]   around everything in your life.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.920]   So a good example is I only use my phone
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.700]   for six hours a day, right?
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.120]   That's a limit that I've constructed
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.260]   that really isn't about my time.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.240]   That's just about keeping myself sane
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.460]   and not getting distracted
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.240]   and being able to be present, you know, with my family.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.700]   Another limit is that I don't travel for work at all.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.920]   And that's really less about the time
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.540]   and more about kind of the wear and tear
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.760]   that I take on when I'm traveling.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.640]   You know, I get invited to speak, you know,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.920]   fairly often and I've refused, you know,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.880]   large amounts of money to do that
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.440]   because one of the least happy places
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   that I am in my life
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.960]   is when I'm sitting in some random town
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.500]   on some random evening, you know,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.320]   just, you know, missing my family.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.720]   And so that's just a limit.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.380]   No matter how much someone offers me
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.840]   to come and pay and speak,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   I just say no.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.920]   And that's less about the time
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.420]   and more about, you know,
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.560]   just not wanting to, you know,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.640]   have the wear and tear
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.100]   and just put myself, you know,
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.680]   ultimately in that space.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.820]   And then around money, you know,
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.180]   money is one of those interesting things
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.580]   where our relationship with money
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.680]   is just like time, just, you know,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.700]   is always evolving, is always changing.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.060]   And I think for myself,
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.880]   there's a lot of limits that I've set around money.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.560]   And, you know, one of those things is,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.840]   you know, how much money I spend on food.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.040]   And I don't really budget,
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.100]   but I naturally try to look for those opportunities
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.280]   where I know that spending
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.200]   is going to be able to create a memory
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.820]   as opposed to just some throwaway spending.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.260]   And so over time, at first,
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260]   this is quite logical.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260]   And you can simply sit down and write down,
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.100]   here are the 20 things that I don't like to do.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.660]   And this can be in your full-time job.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.640]   This can be, you know, with your friends.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.980]   This can be with your diet.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.320]   This can be with, you know, anything.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.940]   Look at those things and use those things
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.180]   that you don't want to do
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.540]   as the place to start setting your limits
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.740]   and pushing your limits, you know, over time.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.140]   As you do this more and more,
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.700]   naturally, your intuition just gets better
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.300]   at assessing opportunities.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.280]   It's just, you have more data inputs.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.840]   And so if someone asks you to do something
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.440]   and you immediately just know,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.080]   ah, that's not going to make me happy.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.740]   That doesn't fit within my limits.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.040]   That doesn't really give me freedom.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.500]   And then, you know, you're able to say no.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.240]   And the last thing I'll add is,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.620]   for me, the most important thing
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.500]   of all of this is time freedom.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.020]   And so I never schedule
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.420]   more than two meetings a day.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.660]   I try to work out every day.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.440]   I want to leave space in my life.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.200]   And that's always been, you know,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.360]   the most important thing
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   because it's the space in your life
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.900]   that you open to
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.360]   when new things ultimately show up.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.700]   And that has really rewarded me
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.080]   because I'm able to, you know,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   follow my curiosity
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.780]   and it generates, you know,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.480]   a lot of happiness,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.920]   you know, in my life.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.700]   But, you know,
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.920]   what are some limits that you have, Chris?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   Okay, so I have some limits,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.260]   but I want to make sure I...
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.220]   I'll come back to them.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.820]   But I want to follow up
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.540]   because a lot of the things you mentioned,
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.660]   you're in a fortunate position to do.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.440]   And so I'm curious how you think
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.480]   these limits might apply to someone
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.600]   who's working in a job
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.060]   and can't afford to just be free
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.200]   for hours a day
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.660]   or not be on their computer
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.300]   or not travel for work
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.280]   as they might need to.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.020]   How do some of these things translate
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.340]   for people that aren't
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.260]   in your situation in life?
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.380]   Yeah, I think the first step
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.940]   is you have to do
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.820]   a bit of an assessment.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.940]   So, you know,
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.780]   if you have a job
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.620]   that you feel stuck in
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.940]   and maybe you don't like
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.140]   or that is really stressful
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.140]   or back to that point about traveling,
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.160]   if you have to travel a lot for work
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.860]   and, you know,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.140]   it's impacting your health
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.660]   and you're spending more time
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.500]   away from your family
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.640]   and you don't really want to,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.500]   it's important to be honest
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.100]   with yourself about that.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.040]   And some simple things
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   that you can do are,
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   you know,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.620]   for your full-time job,
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.920]   write down a list of 20 things
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.580]   that you just really don't like
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.900]   doing in your full-time job
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.760]   and you'd rather limit them
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.840]   and then prioritize those.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.420]   And if possible,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.140]   think about how you can reach out
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.780]   to your manager,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.720]   reach out to your HR department.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.340]   Maybe if you're really tired
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:44.900]   of traveling,
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.160]   there's another role
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.920]   that you can take on
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.560]   in your company
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.400]   or maybe you can limit travel
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.840]   to a certain period
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.260]   or time of the year
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.540]   or work and be proactive
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.260]   about, you know,
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.420]   trying to adjust
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.480]   your full-time job
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.180]   and your role
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.500]   to fit more
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.420]   of what your ideal life looks like
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.220]   and protect your space of freedom.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.740]   You know,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.100]   this is about being proactive
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.920]   instead of being reactive.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.760]   If we don't choose our,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.100]   you know,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.800]   own choices
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.240]   and set our own limits,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   the world naturally
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.200]   sets them for you.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.480]   And this happens
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.720]   within any company.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.480]   You know,
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.020]   the reality
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.880]   and I talk about this
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.400]   a little bit
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.140]   in my first book
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.780]   is that most companies
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.380]   are just legal Ponzi schemes,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.620]   right?
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:23.880]   It's like,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.760]   that's how entrepreneurship works.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.140]   It's like,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.540]   there's the boss at the top
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.380]   and there's the shareholders
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.860]   and there's all the employees.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.960]   And the way that
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.500]   you build a profitable business
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:32.960]   or have,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.480]   you know,
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.360]   a successful company
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.020]   is that you need
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.900]   to get some level
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.520]   of return
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.680]   on your investment
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.860]   on your employees.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.500]   Naturally,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.120]   entrepreneurs default
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.240]   to trying to get
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.400]   as much out of their employees,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.720]   you know,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.380]   as they can,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:44.600]   right?
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.780]   It's like the revenue multiple
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.520]   or profit multiple
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.480]   that you get pure employees.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.360]   And so your company
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.640]   is always going to set limits
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.280]   and they're going to try
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   to push those limits.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.380]   And they know more
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.060]   about those limits
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.580]   than you know
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.320]   about those limits.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.180]   And they're thinking
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.760]   about you,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.360]   the person,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.000]   and they're like,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.780]   how do I give
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.120]   this person enough
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.060]   to keep them happy
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.340]   and to keep them here
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.220]   and to stay,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.760]   you know,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.480]   because it costs
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.500]   the average company
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.060]   40 to 60%
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.320]   of an annual salary
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:08.920]   to, you know,
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.720]   replace an employee.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.620]   So they're thinking
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.740]   about how to keep you
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.720]   just happy enough.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.360]   And so this is important
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.540]   if you just accept
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.920]   what they're offering you,
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.280]   if you don't go in
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.500]   and push a little bit
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.240]   where you can,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.700]   naturally you're going
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.640]   to get pigeonholed
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.100]   with a lot of limits
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.800]   around your life
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.720]   that you didn't set
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.840]   and it's going to be
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.220]   difficult to escape from them.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.400]   And so make that list
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.580]   within your full-time job,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.520]   make that list
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.640]   in how you spend your time
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   outside of your job.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.200]   This is important too.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.980]   And you talk about
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.460]   your friends
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.120]   and your family
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.620]   and even me,
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.040]   you know,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.080]   for the holidays,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.880]   typically,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.940]   we travel for Thanksgiving
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.660]   and Christmas
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.960]   and other holidays
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.080]   and that ends up
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.360]   creating a lot of stress
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.400]   for our family.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.320]   And so we've put
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.280]   these limits around
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.160]   where we'll travel
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.460]   and how we'll travel
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.620]   and we're very honest
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.340]   with our family.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.000]   We have a daughter
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.620]   and so we can say,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.680]   hey, this is better
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.360]   for our daughter
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.240]   that we don't
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.100]   go on this trip.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.820]   And so setting those limits,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.000]   if you, you know,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.900]   have 10 days off
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.880]   of vacation a year
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.960]   and you have to spend
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.940]   seven of those
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.420]   traveling for the holidays
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.260]   and then you come back
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.060]   and you're burnt out
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.100]   and, you know,
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.260]   you don't get rejuvenated
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.140]   and, you know,
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.000]   it's not really
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.760]   how you want to spend
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.660]   your time.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.360]   You have to be honest
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.980]   with your family
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.040]   and friends
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.940]   and set those limits
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.760]   as well.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.740]   And I often find
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.700]   if you're very upfront,
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.480]   it can be a little jarring
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.240]   to people when you say,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.380]   hey, I can't do this.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.060]   But when you express
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.640]   why you're doing it
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   and that, you know,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.860]   it's important,
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.880]   hey, I, you know,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.840]   need to prioritize self-care.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.680]   I need to prioritize
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   my own family.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.360]   You know,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.220]   people will understand
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.060]   and your friends
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.340]   will still be your friends
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.640]   and your family,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.060]   you know,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.180]   hopefully won't
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.020]   won't be too upset.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.860]   So it's really about
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.760]   doing an assessment
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.420]   and all of this
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.000]   is just about
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.680]   being mindful
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.660]   about what you're
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.660]   letting into your life
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.940]   and the impact
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.700]   that it's having
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.700]   having on you.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.620]   And this whole thing
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.580]   is a journey, right?
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.320]   This isn't something
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.260]   that you just woke up
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.060]   one day and said,
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.800]   oh, I have limits.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.300]   I have money
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.840]   and we're done.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.480]   This is something
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.680]   that you can decide
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.380]   what you don't like
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.700]   about your current job.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.620]   You can make
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.720]   some of those changes
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.460]   at your current position.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.380]   Maybe you try
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.160]   to explore
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.740]   whether you could
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.540]   make more of them,
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.300]   move positions,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.160]   move companies.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.120]   We'll talk a little bit
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.060]   later about entrepreneurship.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.720]   You could start
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.580]   something on the side.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.300]   But just to be clear,
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.020]   I'm pretty sure
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.660]   and correct me
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.040]   if I'm wrong,
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.960]   you're not suggesting
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.300]   that you necessarily
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.380]   put up all these limits
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.300]   and change everything
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.640]   all in one go
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   after thinking about,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.120]   you know,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.600]   the conversation
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.440]   we're having right now.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.200]   No, it's really about
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.860]   paying attention
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.860]   to how you feel.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:31.740]   And I think
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.440]   this is the biggest
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.500]   disconnect for me
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.620]   is that I spent
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.560]   my whole career
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.600]   with kind of
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.760]   this Western mind,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.000]   this trying to think
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.680]   my way
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.640]   and outsmart
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.700]   my way
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   through everything.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.080]   But you have to
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.160]   really listen
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.640]   to how you feel
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.500]   and how your body
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.060]   is responding
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.780]   to something.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.360]   And, you know,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.960]   this is one of those
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.520]   perennial,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.140]   timeless debates
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.160]   within philosophy
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.940]   and spirituality
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.420]   where it's like,
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.040]   do I, you know,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.180]   do I try to think
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.080]   my way through this
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   or do I trust
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.720]   my intuition?
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.260]   And I, the longer
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.160]   that I've been
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   an entrepreneur,
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.760]   the longer I've been
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760]   financially independent,
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.300]   the more I recognize
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.420]   that your intuition
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.100]   is actually the strongest
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.560]   gift that you have.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.540]   And most of us
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.380]   just silence it.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.440]   We just keep doing
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.300]   the thing that we've
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.360]   always done
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.240]   because we feel like
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.820]   that's what we are
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.620]   supposed to do
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.480]   and it's often
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.100]   the easiest thing to do.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.520]   And so you end up
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.080]   in a place in your life
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.340]   where all these limits
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.900]   have been set
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.780]   by someone else
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.560]   and you're like,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   geez, how did I
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.560]   get here?
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.100]   How can I change
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   this up a little bit?
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.980]   And you're right.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.840]   It's all about
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.320]   it takes time.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.840]   You don't have
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   to be dramatic.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.800]   You don't have
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.620]   to quit your job.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.340]   You just have
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.240]   to pay attention
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.980]   and listen
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.140]   and recognize
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.940]   that how you feel
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.600]   really matters here.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.520]   If you feel stuck,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.940]   you probably are.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.540]   That doesn't mean
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:49.860]   you have to make
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.800]   massive shifts.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.920]   It's just you can
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.060]   make smaller choices
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.200]   that move you
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.400]   towards a life you love.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.380]   And then the other
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:56.940]   piece, Chris,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.540]   I'll tell you,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.360]   I've talked
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.440]   with so many people
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.060]   and it's so fun
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.920]   in the work that I do
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.500]   because I could just
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.260]   get to hear people's
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:03.920]   life stories
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.000]   and all about their jobs.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.400]   And I realized
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.060]   that so many people
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.660]   are so much closer
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.360]   to a life
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.020]   that they love
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.100]   than they recognize.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.560]   And so they tend
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.720]   to over-focus
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.920]   on the stress
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.700]   and on the negative.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.680]   And especially
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.300]   when we're pursuing
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.120]   financial independence,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.960]   when we're working,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.920]   it's like 80 or 90%
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.700]   of our brain
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.160]   is taken up
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.000]   by the energy
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.220]   and our thinking
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.160]   around our work
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.780]   and our money.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.400]   And then you add
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.160]   family into this.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.980]   I had a daughter,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.640]   you know,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.460]   after reaching
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.260]   financial independence
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.380]   and just the
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.380]   how much less time
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.160]   I have is just
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.140]   ultimately staggering.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.240]   And so if you're
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.120]   working for money
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.020]   and you're stressed
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.840]   about your job
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.140]   and you have a family,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.100]   there's very,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.220]   very little space
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.640]   and time in your life
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.360]   for you to pay
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.600]   attention to your intuition,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.880]   for you to take care
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.420]   of yourself
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.440]   and for you to
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.480]   construct your own
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.240]   space of freedom.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.540]   And so you have to work
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.360]   a little bit harder
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.880]   to carve out that time.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.780]   One of the things
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.520]   that I recommend
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.880]   everyone do,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.600]   if you don't meditate,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.660]   you should start meditating
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.700]   and just try it.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.240]   But I recommend
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.380]   everyone schedule
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.620]   at least a one
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.600]   to two day
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.960]   personal retreat,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.860]   you know,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.580]   every year
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.400]   or ideally,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.080]   you know,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.900]   every six months
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.660]   or once a quarter.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.880]   And hopefully
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.800]   it can be
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.840]   even a silent retreat
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.680]   where you're alone
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.860]   or you go to,
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.180]   you know,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.520]   a Buddhist center.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.060]   You know,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.680]   there are all these
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.820]   kind of small retreats
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.480]   that you can do
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.340]   that you can create
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.020]   a space
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.680]   and an opening
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.360]   in your life
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.640]   that allows more
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.420]   of your intuition
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.940]   to come out
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.940]   and helps to give you
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.560]   more perspective
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.220]   because it's very,
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.180]   very difficult in life
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.820]   when you're so busy
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.760]   and you're so stressed
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.500]   to actually self-reflect.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.780]   You just get stuck
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.540]   in the grind.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.460]   And that's one
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.980]   of the biggest
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.280]   takeaways for me
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.220]   and the biggest thing
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.820]   that I recommend
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.080]   is that you have
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.900]   to create space
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.460]   in your life
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.820]   to figure out
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.380]   how you really
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.660]   feel about something.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.500]   And so anyone
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.220]   can carve out
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.920]   that space,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.520]   you know,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.000]   today
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.780]   just by being
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.080]   intentional about it
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.180]   and then paying attention
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.520]   and then not only
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.100]   listening to how you feel
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.900]   but then taking
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.600]   small actions.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.640]   And so if you
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.620]   don't like your job,
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.560]   can you move
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.320]   to another career
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.120]   over time?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.180]   Are there some pivots
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.780]   that you can make
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.520]   in the day-to-day
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.000]   that make your life
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.880]   more meaningful
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.480]   and give you
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.020]   more happiness
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.560]   and make you
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.260]   less stressed?
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.340]   And a lot of people,
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.760]   like I said,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.660]   are just very close
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.560]   to a life
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.200]   that they love.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.580]   They're so constricted
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.600]   that they lose
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.080]   perspective.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.000]   So for me,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.080]   it's fun to be able
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.760]   to go in and say,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.980]   hey, let's talk
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.620]   about your life.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:26.960]   Wow.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.160]   You love your friends.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.220]   You love your family.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.260]   You love the city
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.980]   that you live in.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.460]   You love your softball team.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.840]   You love your parents.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.520]   You know,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.700]   you have great hobbies
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.260]   but, you know,
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.200]   your job is really,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.080]   really stressing you out.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   But all you've really
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.480]   talked about
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.000]   is your job.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.580]   Let's look at,
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.100]   you know,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.460]   the other 85%
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.000]   of the things
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.400]   that you have
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.880]   in your life
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.900]   you really love.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.300]   It's just this one thing
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.920]   that's dominating
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.000]   so much of your thinking
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.180]   and maybe you already
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.460]   have so much
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.240]   of what you seek.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.180]   And so that's really
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.820]   what I try to do
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.360]   in my work
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.560]   is just help
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.720]   share a language
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.560]   that people can use
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.600]   and reflect on
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.860]   to get a little bit
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.580]   more perspective
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.940]   on these ideas
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.560]   of money,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.300]   time,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:04.800]   and freedom
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   and then,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.140]   you know,
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.860]   move closer
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.120]   to a life
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.500]   that really,
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.540]   really fulfills them.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.240]   This episode
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.840]   is brought to you
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   by Copilot.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.680]   If you're looking
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.460]   to get your finances
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.380]   organized this year,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.420]   you have to check out
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:15.920]   Copilot.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.380]   It's one of my favorite apps
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:17.980]   and I check it
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.140]   almost every day
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.940]   because it makes it
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.100]   so seamless and easy
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.940]   to manage your money
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.040]   and track your spending,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.020]   which for us
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.560]   has resulted
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.700]   in a huge boost
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.380]   to our savings.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.320]   And I've tried
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.120]   dozens of apps
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.660]   that do this.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.180]   I've even made
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.920]   a whole episode
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.500]   about it,
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.300]   but Copilot
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.080]   is the only one
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.780]   I've kept using
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.020]   and I have no plans
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.580]   to stop.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.840]   You can link accounts
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.340]   at over 10,000 institutions
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.780]   and their AI-powered
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.060]   expense categorization
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.900]   is the best
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.440]   I've used
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.520]   with custom Amazon
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.600]   and Venmo integrations
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.660]   to make it even better.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.980]   You can completely
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.860]   design your spending
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.320]   categories and subcategories
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.640]   and easily set up rules
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.780]   to assign transactions
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.020]   to them in the future.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.320]   Thanks to Copilot,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.200]   I have never had
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.880]   a better grasp
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.540]   on our spending
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.460]   and cash flow,
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.600]   which I'm pretty sure
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.120]   has resulted
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.300]   in thousands of dollars
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.560]   of savings every year.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.880]   So for the best app
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.780]   to track your spending,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.400]   subscriptions,
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.200]   and investments,

[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.760]   This episode
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.400]   is brought to you
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.120]   by Element.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.740]   Now, I love Element
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.400]   and I use it
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.140]   all the time
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.800]   because it helps
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.400]   anyone stay hydrated
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.540]   without the sugar
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.980]   and other dodgy ingredients
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.600]   in popular electrolyte
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.440]   and sports drinks.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.620]   And that's important
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.940]   because electrolyte deficiency
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.640]   or imbalance
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.500]   can cause headaches,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.540]   cramps, fatigue,
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.280]   brain fog,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.020]   and weakness.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.300]   In fact, Element
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.700]   is a zero-sugar

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.620]   I've got three follow-ups.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.260]   So first,
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.560]   one of the places
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.000]   I've enjoyed finding
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   that space personally
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   is in a sauna.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.760]   And there's plenty
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.920]   of health benefits to that.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.320]   We're not even
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.940]   going to mention that.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.580]   The one really great benefit
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.460]   is that it is so hot
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.560]   that you don't want
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.280]   to bring your phone in.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:48.800]   You know,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.380]   like it's dark.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.140]   Sometimes I bring in
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.580]   a pencil
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.200]   and a piece of paper,
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   but I have this place
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.420]   to go where I can't
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.280]   do a lot
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.100]   but think
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.960]   and be with myself
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.100]   or my wife will join
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.820]   and we can talk,
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.020]   but we're not distracted.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.580]   We're not looking
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.260]   at phones.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.180]   We're not listening
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.660]   to music.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.760]   There's no TV on.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.700]   And so that's one space
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.640]   I've really enjoyed
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.260]   that, you know,
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.740]   I'm not going to go
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.120]   to the sauna
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.880]   for two days
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.780]   for a personal retreat,
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.680]   but to get half an hour,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.480]   20 minutes,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.460]   a few times a week
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.860]   is great.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.680]   So that was one thought.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.920]   The second one
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.780]   is when you said 85%,
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.120]   it really struck me
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.800]   and you were talking
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.320]   about, you know,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.340]   85% of your life
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:25.960]   might be the life
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.380]   you love
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.440]   and the work part
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.020]   of it might not
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.820]   be something you love.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.800]   I wish I could remember
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.880]   which episode,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.620]   I'll try to put in
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.000]   the show notes
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.780]   if I can find it,
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.980]   where I was talking
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.360]   with someone
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.080]   and they pointed out
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.740]   like people don't
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.740]   have to love their job.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.580]   Like this idea
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.780]   of pursue your passion
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.900]   and your work
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.100]   has to define you
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.120]   and be the thing you love.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.060]   I think there are
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.600]   a lot of people
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.200]   that I've met
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.000]   in my career
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.900]   that I know
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.560]   in my family
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.540]   and extended family
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.180]   that they might not
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.960]   love their job
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.840]   but they've recognized
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.620]   that their job
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.200]   enables them
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.940]   to have a life
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.520]   they love
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.980]   and I think
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.660]   one of the really
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.660]   important things
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.300]   that they've managed
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:58.960]   to separate
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.040]   and where I want
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.880]   to spend a little bit
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.560]   of time talking
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.400]   is that
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.100]   they haven't made it
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.700]   their mission
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.760]   to level up
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.400]   their career
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.640]   and have more money
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.340]   and more,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:09.840]   you know,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.480]   responsibility
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.300]   and more title
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.260]   because they've recognized
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.100]   they love their job
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.820]   and you've said,
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.040]   you know,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.920]   people don't really
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.600]   feel free
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.320]   until they know
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.120]   what enough is
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.940]   and so I think
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.820]   the people I know
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.480]   that have managed
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.140]   to find a lot of peace
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:21.900]   and happiness
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.040]   in a job
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.860]   they don't necessarily love
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.280]   have recognized
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.040]   that that job
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.920]   is already putting them
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.500]   on the path
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.300]   to have enough
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.320]   and that allows them
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:31.900]   to be happy
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.120]   so I'm curious
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   how you think about
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.720]   enough
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.760]   and defining it
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.280]   because one of the lines
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.980]   you said in the book
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.100]   is if you don't take time
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:39.480]   to figure out
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.140]   what you really need
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.960]   chasing more money
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   is an aimless pursuit
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.280]   and so how do you think
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.180]   about that question
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:44.940]   because I know
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.480]   it's a hard one.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.060]   you mentioned
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.860]   an important word here
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.200]   peace
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.380]   and I think
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.960]   everyone wants
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.100]   to feel more peace
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.620]   in their life
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.700]   and we often
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.300]   don't think about
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.020]   what peace is
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.700]   we think about
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.680]   peace as having
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.520]   no stress
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.920]   but what it really means
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.980]   is that you have
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.100]   an elevated perspective
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.420]   on your life
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.360]   and you're able
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.460]   to very clearly
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.360]   look at the things
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.540]   coming into your life
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.280]   and the things
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.520]   going on in your life
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   and not judge them
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.800]   and so this is
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.420]   very important.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.380]   There are some people
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.460]   that are more naturally
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.420]   wired for peace
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.340]   and you're talking
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.120]   about some of them
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.740]   and I have a friend
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.180]   like this
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.200]   he works for the EPA
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.900]   has a great job
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.020]   lives in Seattle
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.600]   Washington
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.020]   spends time
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.420]   hiking in the mountains
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.900]   camping with his son
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.380]   and he's got this job
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.520]   that he has to go to
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.280]   and it doesn't light him up
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.480]   he doesn't love it
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.160]   it doesn't fulfill him
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.420]   but it's secure
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.360]   when he's there
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:35.860]   he's there
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.500]   and when he's not
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.020]   he doesn't have to
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.640]   think about it
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.000]   and it allows him
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.420]   to build an incredibly
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.040]   peaceful life
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.180]   and like you mentioned
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.240]   he's just at peace
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.700]   that this job
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.300]   is a means to an end
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.660]   it gives him the money
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.840]   to do the things
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.900]   that he wants to do
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.580]   and do them
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.340]   with frequency
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.320]   goes to Hawaii
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.460]   multiple times a year
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.620]   and this is important
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.420]   because he's able
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.240]   to do this
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   because he knows
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.940]   what he loves
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.400]   he's been honest
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.060]   with himself
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.240]   I like hiking
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.200]   I like golfing
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.460]   I like grilling
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.360]   in my backyard
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.700]   I like playing
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.100]   basketball with my son
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.140]   he's listed out
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.680]   those things
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.360]   that he loves
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.040]   and having his job
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.180]   gives him the time
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:15.780]   to do that
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.860]   and then he's not
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.520]   stressed
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.100]   he's not kept up
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.340]   and so cultivating
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.360]   peace in your life
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.280]   is really about
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.260]   being in alignment
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.160]   with what you love
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.900]   and you can do this
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.500]   as an entrepreneur
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.280]   you can do this
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.420]   as a full-time employee
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.900]   and the more alignment
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900]   that you have
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.640]   in your life
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.580]   the greater peace
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.200]   that you're naturally
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.760]   going to feel
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.160]   you don't find peace
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.180]   peace arises
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.000]   in your life
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.480]   it's a byproduct
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.740]   of moving towards
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.280]   the things
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.180]   that you enjoy
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.900]   and that you love
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.880]   but the thing is
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.480]   it's often so easy
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.040]   in life
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   just to chase more money
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.520]   it's just what
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.420]   so many people do
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.160]   it's just okay
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.700]   I'm going to make
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.120]   more money
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.640]   I'm going to go
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.460]   after this thing
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.380]   even when you reach
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.080]   financial independence
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.840]   I'm going to
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.020]   work to get this raise
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.020]   and all of a sudden
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.800]   you look back
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   20 years from now
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.680]   on your life
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:23:59.960]   and you're like
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.020]   wait how did I spend
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.080]   my time
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.860]   or you know
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.080]   someone near you
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.700]   gets sick
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.520]   or you get sick
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.820]   and you're forced
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.260]   to kind of
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.160]   take a hard look
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.560]   in the mirror
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.940]   and be like
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.560]   wow is this
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.680]   really how
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.520]   I want to be
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.000]   living my life
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.700]   and I think
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.520]   a lot of people
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.420]   out there
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.260]   think they know
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.160]   what they love
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.840]   but they haven't
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.360]   really thought
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.120]   about it deeply
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.140]   and they haven't
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.700]   thought about
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.940]   how they really
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.720]   want to spend
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.300]   their time
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.140]   and the role
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.640]   that money
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.600]   ultimately plays
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:25.880]   in it
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.280]   it's about
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.000]   carving out
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.660]   maybe a couple
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.440]   of hours a week
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.560]   to think through
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.680]   what is my
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.600]   relationship with money
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.180]   did how I spend
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.720]   this money
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.620]   make me happy
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.400]   do I want to
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:35.980]   keep spending
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.540]   my money
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.580]   this way
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.320]   am I making
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.980]   enough money
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.160]   to live the life
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.020]   that I want to live
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:41.720]   and will I be able
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.380]   to do that
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.520]   with some level
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.200]   of certainty
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.940]   for a long period
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.360]   of time
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.320]   and this is that
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.020]   balance right
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.080]   between saving
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.680]   and spending
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   where you want
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.200]   to figure out
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.020]   okay is it worth
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.900]   spending today
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.580]   to do the things
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.280]   that I love
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.380]   or worth
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.540]   saving this money
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.840]   and compounding
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.220]   the amount
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:24:59.800]   of freedom
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.040]   and opportunity
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.080]   that this money
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.160]   has over the long term
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.080]   and then the other
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.900]   piece is that
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.920]   for me specifically
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.980]   my definition
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.440]   of enough
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.540]   continues to change
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.980]   as new things
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.840]   happen in my life
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.340]   when I reached
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.140]   financial independence
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.780]   you know I thought
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.340]   that I could live
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.840]   on you know
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.240]   50 or 60 thousand dollars
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.340]   I have a child
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.600]   kids are expensive
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.680]   I want her to have
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.740]   the best life possible
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.720]   so my definition
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.280]   of enough
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.660]   has to change
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.400]   and in fact
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.720]   more of my definition
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.780]   is about her
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.200]   and about my family
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.300]   than about myself
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   because between me
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.840]   and my wife
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.060]   I'm one
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.100]   out of three
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.860]   in the equation
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.520]   and so
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.380]   my definition
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.840]   of enough
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.320]   has actually
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.640]   extended beyond myself
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.560]   to be more
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.320]   about my family
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.540]   so there's things
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.640]   that my wife
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.280]   and daughter
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.420]   naturally would want
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.200]   to spend money on
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.140]   that I wouldn't
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.740]   but you know
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.520]   we spend that money
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.480]   because you know
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:46.960]   I know it makes
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.420]   them happy
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.060]   and so this is
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.760]   something that you
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.560]   never truly figure out
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.640]   but it's something
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.580]   that gets easier
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.420]   over time
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.200]   when you're
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.180]   intentional about it
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.440]   and you take the time
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.220]   to just to think
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:58.960]   through these things
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.760]   and that's really
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.640]   what I want my
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.860]   books to be about
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.540]   it's an opportunity
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.760]   of reflection
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.320]   where you can look
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.860]   back and say
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.720]   huh maybe I have
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.260]   been spending
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:08.980]   too much time
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.740]   chasing money
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.880]   and maybe I should
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.820]   be spending my time
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.580]   you know doing
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.300]   something else
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.920]   or maybe I don't
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.780]   need as much money
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.260]   as I think I'll need
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:17.960]   right now
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.340]   because so much
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.240]   of the news out there
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.220]   the financial advice
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.740]   it's just negative
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.900]   it forces you
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.600]   to feel like
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.240]   you're never going
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:25.900]   to have enough
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.140]   in order to sell you
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.020]   a financial product
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.760]   and so that people
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.260]   get in that
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.980]   natural mindset
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.460]   I'm not going
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.760]   to have enough
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.340]   for retirement
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.280]   I'm not going
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:32.540]   to be able
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.020]   to live on
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.900]   my money forever
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.660]   I need to
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.520]   to hoard it
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:35.980]   I need to make
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.720]   all these massive
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.420]   sacrifices
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.500]   and so yeah
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.100]   my definition
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.580]   of enough
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.320]   is certainly
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.000]   in flux
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.800]   but I feel
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.600]   very comfortable
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.440]   because I've
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.180]   taken the time
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.260]   to think through
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.340]   this in my
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.080]   own life
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.000]   and then that
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.480]   gives me
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.080]   the ability
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.720]   just to live
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.280]   my life
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.140]   instead of
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.060]   always wondering
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.260]   gosh should I
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:54.980]   work harder
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.680]   should I grow
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.260]   my company
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:56.720]   bigger
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.400]   should I
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.980]   find another
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.960]   income stream
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.520]   should I do
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.280]   something different
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.080]   I know there's
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.660]   a period of your
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.440]   life where you
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:03.940]   weren't thinking
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.480]   this way
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.260]   and you were
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.600]   grinding really hard
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.100]   100% man
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.920]   and that enabled
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.260]   you to reach
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.960]   financial independence
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.920]   and now have
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.440]   this kind of
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.480]   elevated perspective
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.720]   totally man
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.620]   but do you think
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.180]   you could have
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.760]   done it
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.380]   with this perspective
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.160]   from the start
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.220]   or do you think
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.120]   there is a season
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.640]   of life
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.860]   where what
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.200]   you need
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.480]   to do
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.760]   or what
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.120]   you might
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.700]   want to do
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:26.980]   or how
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.280]   you might
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:27.720]   want to use
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.600]   your time
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.980]   is to go
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.540]   and make
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:30.980]   more money
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.860]   and grind
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.960]   and hustle
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.480]   and spend
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.000]   all the time
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.500]   and energy
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.600]   so that your
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.580]   future life
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.380]   which now you
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:37.960]   have a family
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.420]   and kid
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.560]   is easier
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.480]   dude I write
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.560]   these books
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.560]   for my younger
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:43.940]   self
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.740]   I wish that
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.320]   I could tell
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.460]   my 27 year old
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.020]   self just to
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.500]   chill out
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.740]   enjoy the journey
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   you're still
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.120]   going to get
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.500]   there
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.020]   it might take
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.380]   you twice
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:52.740]   the amount
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.280]   of time
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.160]   the things
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.720]   that I said
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.420]   no to in my
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:55.760]   life
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.300]   I'm not going
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:56.620]   to say I have
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:56.980]   regrets
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.720]   but you know
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.280]   I wish I would
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.680]   have gone
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.540]   to the music
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.340]   festivals with my
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:00.660]   friends
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.180]   I wish I would
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.720]   have gone out
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.440]   to drinks with
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:02.900]   them instead
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.520]   of just building
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.260]   my businesses
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.060]   and websites
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.780]   you know
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.320]   in my room
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.980]   you know
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.600]   on my own
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.320]   I wish I would
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:09.840]   have spent more
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.400]   time nurturing
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   some friendships
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.120]   and relationships
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.920]   that I lost
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.480]   I think you're
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.040]   right that there's
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.520]   times to grind
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.880]   and times to rest
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.560]   naturally if you're
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.660]   younger you have
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.160]   more time
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.720]   you have more
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.180]   energy
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.140]   right now I can't
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.060]   do nearly as much
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.760]   at the age of 40
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.320]   that I could
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.700]   at 25 you know
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.020]   when I was
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.180]   invincible and so
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:27.900]   I feel grateful
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.640]   that I was able
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.160]   between 25 and 30
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.300]   to make all this
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.100]   money and save
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.080]   and really really
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.240]   hustle I did make
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.020]   some sacrifices
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.340]   that I wish I
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.100]   didn't make but
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.340]   yeah I used my
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.120]   young energy
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.540]   and now having a
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.720]   kid being my age
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.600]   I'm like I can't
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.820]   imagine just
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.120]   starting now to
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.940]   save it'll
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.640]   certainly be more
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.540]   challenging you know
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.240]   and more difficult
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.500]   so yes I think you
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.160]   should do this
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.620]   when you're
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.820]   younger and have
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.500]   more energy and
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.400]   have more time and
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.760]   have fewer
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.120]   responsibilities because
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.280]   there's just less
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.700]   constricting your
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.840]   life you know when
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.560]   you're younger and
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.360]   you have a lot less
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.780]   to lose and so I
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.420]   think you're right
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.300]   right about that but
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.000]   I wish I would have
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.740]   had more balance
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.760]   that's just not how
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.580]   I'm wired I grew up
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.260]   in a home where
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:08.880]   money was always
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.660]   tight money was
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.400]   always stressful
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.340]   money was just
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.180]   everything that my
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.080]   parents talked about
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.280]   and so for me it
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.160]   was like once you
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.660]   know I got out into
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.260]   the world it was
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.460]   just it had so much
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.380]   anxiety and stress
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.980]   for me I meet
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.600]   people in their
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.840]   20s now and some
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.420]   of them are just so
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.360]   relaxed and it's so
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.660]   easy for them to you
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.120]   know follow their
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.020]   passions and do the
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.780]   things they love and
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.800]   I'm a little jealous of
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.760]   that we're all wired a
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.320]   little bit differently
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.900]   and we also change
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.080]   faster than we
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.960]   recognize that we're
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.180]   changing I think a lot
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.420]   of us fight change in
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.640]   our life and we don't
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.320]   like to reflect on hey
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.280]   maybe I don't love the
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.660]   things that I used to
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.300]   love and so it's just
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.700]   recognizing that it's
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.780]   fine to sprint and
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.700]   fine to rest but
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.540]   having a little bit of
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.960]   perspective on you
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.660]   know why you're
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.600]   pursuing this journey
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.660]   ideally having some
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.280]   level of a definite
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.900]   goal so for me to try
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.500]   to save a million
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.400]   dollars as quickly as
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.560]   possible and then once
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.460]   I got there I was just
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.720]   able to stop and
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.760]   reevaluate it was like
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.620]   okay I don't really have
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.520]   to think about money as
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.720]   much where am I going
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.180]   next and so you know
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.040]   there's levels to this
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.940]   right and this is one of
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.380]   the things where there's
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.180]   kind of these ladders
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.140]   that you climb up in
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.000]   your life and then you
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.440]   get a little more
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.200]   perspective and you're
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.500]   like whoa do I want
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.480]   to take this other
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.520]   ladder and you know
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.640]   even now man I meet so
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.800]   many successful
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.100]   entrepreneurs you know
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.560]   in New York who have
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.520]   way more money than me
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.460]   or far more successful
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.780]   and some of them are
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.740]   happy and some of them
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.300]   aren't and people are
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.940]   wired very differently
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.160]   often the people who are
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.880]   happiest are doing
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.620]   things that they really
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.580]   love and they're
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.500]   challenged and they're
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.580]   growing and they're
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.880]   very outgoing but I
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.240]   love meeting someone
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.700]   who's you know more
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.840]   financially successful
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.600]   than me and being able
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.500]   to be like whoa I
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.180]   feel very happy with
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.560]   where I'm at because I
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.180]   can't imagine living
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:48.900]   their life.

[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.720]   such a big part of the

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.400]   important and now that

[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.360]   yoga or even lounging or
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.520]   running errands or going
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.020]   out to dinner.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.560]   Seriously I wear my

[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.420]   all the time.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.760]   But today I want to talk
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.640]   about their Dream Knit

[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.860]   While it's almost
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.000]   impossible to narrow my
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.160]   Viore recommendations down

[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.280]   Yeah when we talk about
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.720]   enough I think for me to go
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.820]   back I said I would come back
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.620]   and talk about limits.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.300]   One of the things that really
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.160]   helped me and I think it was
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.780]   Rachel Cruz was said was
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.300]   you know budgets actually
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.820]   very freeing because when you
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.300]   define how much you can spend
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.420]   to be within your means you
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.660]   can you can spend it.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.500]   You know when you don't know
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.520]   how much you have to spend
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.600]   then it feels like everything
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.220]   could be stressful.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.740]   But for us I think we kind of
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.060]   line item went through the
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.440]   categories of spending and we
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.180]   compared you know with some
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.160]   basic you know 4% rule or
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.480]   3% rule whatever you want to
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.020]   use math to figure out how we
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.400]   were trending and how much
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.660]   we're making and we kind of
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.420]   got to this point where we
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.860]   said do we want to spend more
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.760]   money or do we want to spend
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.320]   more time to create more money
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.460]   because if we spend more
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.220]   money now like we have to
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.420]   replace it or we're not going
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.200]   to save enough for for the
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.480]   future.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.380]   So that really made it easy to
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.360]   say well we don't need a
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.880]   bigger this or we don't need
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.100]   more elaborate vacations or we
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.360]   can get more creative about you
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.560]   know how to use the the points
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.340]   of the mile so we don't have
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.280]   to pay more for those
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.800]   vacations.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.000]   But that was really helpful
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.940]   for us because we see people
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.100]   all around us spending more
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.240]   money on certain things that
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.300]   we're spending money on.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.380]   and it can make you feel
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.460]   insecure but I actually feel
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.420]   really secure because we could
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.300]   go spend that money.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.800]   We just know that the trade
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.960]   off of what will happen if we
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.400]   spend that money is actually is
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.280]   not worth it because we
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.460]   thought about that impact.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.520]   And so to your point thinking
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.040]   about you know where you are
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.260]   what you need might take some
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.680]   you know basic retirement
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.240]   calculations you could go use a
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.480]   tool to run through that.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.440]   I'm actually I think I'm
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.780]   working on an episode of all
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.380]   the different kind of financial
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.980]   planning tools that you can use
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.180]   on your own to project your
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.320]   net worth and all that kind of
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.760]   stuff but because we've done
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.680]   that work it feels really easy
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   to say no to spending more
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.140]   money because we know we don't
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.240]   want to spend it that way.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.180]   When it comes to a lot of
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.320]   people's advice on financial
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.740]   independence I think that it
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.500]   often comes to save save save
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.040]   cut your expenses limit what you
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.820]   have so that you can save as
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.720]   much as possible.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.040]   how do you think about that
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.280]   trade-off on your path to
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.740]   financial independence of trying
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.240]   to save more versus trying to
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.680]   earn more?
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.760]   Always more valuable to earn more
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.940]   money while you can because you
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.300]   just really don't know how long
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.000]   the opportunity that you have is
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.680]   going to last.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.160]   We see this with all the layoffs
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.700]   of all the tech companies we see
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.420]   this with the algorithm changes
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.760]   and online businesses and Etsy
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.320]   seller restrictions and I mean
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.160]   there's just so many changes that
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.800]   are happening in our world that
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.440]   when you can make money and you
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.360]   have the opportunity to make
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.620]   money you should try to make as
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.060]   much as possible and then save as
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.720]   much of that as possible to give
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.180]   you more options you know in the
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.780]   future and so de-risking your life
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.980]   is just about investing in the you
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.920]   that you've yet to become so it's
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.520]   always going to be easier in life to
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.220]   have more money and more options
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.480]   than not and when you go back at a
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.440]   very basic level there's very very
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.940]   little in our life that we can
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.680]   actually control and I think that
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.560]   really scares people talk about that
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.020]   you know in the book you know how
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.880]   we're kind of stuck between this
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.600]   sort of like level you know of
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.260]   uncertainty and this level of
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.160]   control and the most important way
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.620]   to deal with this is to control the
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.200]   things that you can and then just
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.920]   forget about the rest and so when it
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.260]   comes to earning money try to earn as
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.100]   much as you can try to save as much
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.140]   as you can don't save to the point
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.980]   where you're unhappy I wouldn't say
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.840]   that I was unhappy when I was saving
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.460]   you know 82 percent of my income but I
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.160]   could have you know lived a little bit
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.380]   better and done a few more things but
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.100]   no opportunity lasts forever everything
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.360]   is changing and I think a lot of people
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   underestimate the level of kind of risk
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.580]   and uncertainty in their life and they
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.180]   just think oh I'm gonna have this job
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.440]   forever oh I'm always gonna be able to
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.460]   save 20 percent of my income but we
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.300]   have no idea what the future holds and
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.800]   so it's really about managing your
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.600]   money in a way that helps you de-risk
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.220]   your life and controlling those
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.620]   variables you know while you can and I
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.160]   even think about this you know in my
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.280]   own life it can naturally be risky to
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.120]   be an entrepreneur I'm always thinking
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.660]   about okay what's the five-year plan for
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.660]   this business and this company and how
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.520]   can I get out within the next five years
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.360]   and so I try to build businesses to sell
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.700]   because I'm worried about really the
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.780]   economic risk of any sort of market
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.000]   opportunity or business and so important
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.040]   to save and earn money while you can
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.480]   because you don't know how long that's
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.540]   going to last and you don't want to get
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.820]   stuck in a place where you have to make
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.980]   really really drastic decisions in your
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.180]   life like needing to sell your house and
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.380]   so that goes back to this idea of the
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.280]   space of freedom money factors into that
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.340]   of course right what is your safety net
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.020]   what is your level of cash reserves how
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.600]   much you know of your investment
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.320]   portfolio is liquid versus locked up in
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.800]   something that if the real estate market
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.580]   crashes you know you couldn't sell I'm
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.420]   very much like you I've used the
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.920]   spreadsheets I've used the tools you
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.060]   know for years and I'm a very very
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.500]   numbers person but when that's all that
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.800]   I thought about I was so limited in my
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.980]   thinking and so all of this is really
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.640]   about adding a level of heart to the
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.700]   head thinking about how you feel before
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.920]   just looking at the spreadsheet or just
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.640]   looking at the numbers and I think if we
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.820]   do more of that it naturally helps us
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.140]   create more you know freedom and peace in
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.520]   our life because we've gone through the
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.480]   work very much like you have and I've
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.280]   talked with you and now for a number of
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.960]   years and know some of the decisions that
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.860]   you've made with your wife around your
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.680]   business and the choices and I think you
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.680]   naturally are doing this work and that's
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.540]   why you know you're happier for it I
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.140]   think I'm definitely happier for it but
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.140]   there's a bit of a contradiction and I'm
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.460]   not sure what someone listening might be
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.340]   able to do about it thinking of kind of
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.040]   the the common golden handcuffs situation
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.400]   you've got this great job you're getting
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.200]   paid the harder you work the more you get
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.040]   promoted the more you earn the more
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.800]   bonus and so on one hand I hear you
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.440]   saying like take advantage of that while
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.020]   you have it and then on the other hand I
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.560]   hear you saying well set up some limits
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.920]   and don't put it all into one place so
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.320]   that you can be happy how do you think
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.520]   people should process the fact that if
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   they have a high-paying job and and it's
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.100]   not the life they live how long do you
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.260]   take advantage of that and when do you
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.340]   stop and start to make changes so that
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.700]   you can be happy I love that you brought
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.780]   this up because isn't this the paradox of
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.920]   life and I think that people were always
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.020]   stuck between this duality we're always
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.340]   stuck between these two choices should we
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.520]   work harder should we rest should we
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.860]   spend more money should we save more
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.320]   money and for everyone listening I don't
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.120]   know what your life looks like I don't
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.140]   know who you are what your dreams are
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.160]   what's important is to recognize that
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.600]   there's a balance between these two
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.540]   things and being honest with yourself
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.680]   and intentional is the only way to do
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.920]   this and create peace in your life there's
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.860]   no way that I can tell someone hey
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.840]   you're 25 you need to grind you need to
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.400]   bear it out for the next five years or hey
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.760]   you're grinding it out but you hate your
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.180]   job you need to quit this is a delicate
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.500]   balance here where you need to make the
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.280]   decisions for your own life I just think
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.600]   it's important to set up these questions
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.100]   because within these questions within this
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.420]   paradox is everything that it means to be
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.160]   alive we have to balance all of these
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.700]   forces and so the more intentional that we
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.800]   are the more time that we give to thinking
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.500]   about this naturally we learn to do what
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.140]   we know we should do and I think that's an
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.820]   important thing once again you can't
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.100]   always think yourself through these
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.940]   answers you have to trust your intuition
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.280]   you have to listen and pay attention to
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.680]   how things make you feel so let's say
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.160]   someone's golden handcuffs making five
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.240]   hundred thousand dollars a year spending
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.380]   all their money have nothing saved two kids
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.980]   private school feel like they have no
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.480]   choices no options in a vast majority of
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.140]   case you have options but those options
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.580]   are going to change your life in some way
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.280]   and I would argue that for someone like
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.760]   that they probably need a change because
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.120]   there's massive amounts of risk in their
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.440]   life in that scenario and they need to
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.620]   de-risk their life in some way and so
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.140]   that's doing an inventory of where you spend
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.680]   your money hey maybe we're not actually
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.840]   making enough money to send our kids to
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.080]   private school and the public schools where
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   we live aren't that great so maybe we
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.480]   actually have to move and maybe we have to
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.920]   change houses and maybe we have to de-risk our
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.240]   life a little bit even though we're happy with
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:04.440]   everything that we're doing in our life we're on a fast collision path to having
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:10.020]   nothing in the future and we're just living on the edge and that's a tough
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.780]   conversation to have with someone it's a tough conversation to have with yourself
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:21.300]   and it's an important one to have because if you feel like you should be having that
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.340]   conversation with yourself then you really should and the longer that you put off anything the more
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:32.420]   difficult that that conversation then can become and so yes there are people in life who are in
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:38.740]   very difficult circumstances who are stuck and have very very few options single parents
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:47.220]   stable job two kids can't imagine you know doing any of the things that we're talking about here and
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.820]   that's where it's more difficult to create limits around your life and you have to work even harder
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:58.580]   to do it because there's just less time and space and flexibility built into your life
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:06.420]   but there's so many pivots that we can make from going back to school learning new skills trying to
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:12.340]   make money on the side to get some of that entrepreneurial empowerment and save a little
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:18.340]   bit of extra money the important thing is that you do what's within your capacity to
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:24.980]   build the life that you want to have and just move towards it no matter how small those steps
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:30.100]   are and i've had people reach out to me one woman was homeless she reached out to me she said say i
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:35.860]   read an article on you on cnbc i was very inspired i read your book i started working at wendy's i
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:41.780]   started saving my money i signed up to work at a real real estate brokerage i ended up getting a brokerage
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:48.100]   license now i'm a realtor i just passed a hundred million dollars in sales and this is within a three-year
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:53.540]   period and this is like a really top you know performing realtor in the dallas fort worth area and so
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.900]   she's just made all these massive changes in her life just from being you know inspired by you know
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:05.700]   one story and that's a really extenuating example but it's important no matter what's going on in your
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:12.980]   life just to to ask yourself what does freedom mean to me how much is enough how can i create more peace
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:18.580]   in my life are there some changes that i can make with how i'm spending and making and saving money
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:24.980]   it can move me closer to a life that i love and then move towards that and then over time check in
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:30.020]   with yourself as you're living your life just to make sure you're moving closer rather than further

[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:48.660]   book is inner entrepreneur and at first i thought oh this is a book all about starting companies and then i realized
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.700]   um maybe this is a book all about being in charge of your own life but that doesn't mean that
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:00.180]   entrepreneurship isn't a piece so i'm curious how you think of entrepreneurship as a source of income
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:09.300]   or a career path fits into the average person's world for happiness and a fulfilling life so we talked about
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.340]   how there's only so many things in your life that you can actually control and how you make money is
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:19.780]   one of those things and so entrepreneurship is really about making money on your own terms and figuring out
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.460]   ways to make money outside of your full-time job or in addition to your full-time job so you're not
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:32.100]   solely reliant on someone else's profit dreams and someone else's you know life plan because whenever
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.180]   you're working for someone else you're working for someone else and that's fine you can reach
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:41.460]   financial independence you know working a regular full-time job there are some incredible jobs out
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.340]   there but i think that everyone should test being an entrepreneur they should try it out they should
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.660]   see how it makes them feel they should think through it they should say hey is there a way that
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:55.780]   i can make a little additional money you know outside of my job is there a way i can move towards
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:01.300]   entrepreneurship it's at least worth thinking about and so the book is really about how to do that
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:08.340]   it's about how to think like an entrepreneur it's about how to test being an entrepreneur it's also
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:15.140]   for entrepreneurs who might feel a little stuck and not understand where this could go when i started
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:20.260]   you know businesses i had no idea how to build a company to sell no idea that i could sell a company
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:26.420]   had no idea what a holding company was no idea how to grow a company and so there's so much in the book
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.500]   that if you're curious about entrepreneurship if you're making a little money on the side even
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:36.100]   if you have a business and you're like where should i go with this i wanted to put everything that i
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:42.980]   think is important in building businesses into this one book even so people can read it and say hey gosh
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:48.180]   that sounds like so much work i don't want to do that but hopefully people read it and they're able
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:53.620]   to say hey i'm going to try this out and i've been doing some freelance consulting on the side now i
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.820]   understand why building a consulting business is probably a terrible business and here's how i can
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:05.140]   pivot and do something different instead or hey i've wanted to launch this product on amazon and i've
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.300]   seen all these things about how amazing it is what is it actually can you actually build a product on
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:16.260]   amazon today or how does you know digital marketing work or how do you build a brand or tell stories or
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.900]   create a content driven business like what are all these things and i feel like i'm a hundred years
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.220]   old and internet years chris you know it's like because i got my laptop my first laptop when i was
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:30.820]   seven and so it's like one of these things too for younger people or even people who are influencers
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:36.980]   it's like hey the opportunity that you have is changing so so rapidly so here's how you take advantage
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:42.020]   of it and here's what you should be thinking about and what you should be doing and all this other
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.740]   stuff just really doesn't matter as much i know you've talked a lot about ai there's just so much
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:53.140]   massive change going on in our world that really is empowering for entrepreneurs not that great for
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:58.900]   full-time employees who are you know easy easier to be replaced now as as we're starting to see but
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.860]   incredible for entrepreneurs because you used to need all these teams and all these tools and these
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:10.020]   expensive sas products and now you can use just a couple of tools and you know get massive amounts of scale
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:18.340]   and leverage so you can be a designer a coder a marketer a product manager all with a couple of
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:23.540]   you know inexpensive or free ai tools if you're willing to to put in the work so i really wish i
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:28.500]   was actually starting my entrepreneurial journey now there's just so much more available i know it's um
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:36.260]   um it's crazy we we wanted to set up a site for all the hacks members to be able to share their referral
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:41.060]   links so that you know anytime i'm talking about a product sometimes i have a referral link sometimes i
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:47.220]   don't and sometimes i have one and it caps out so i shared the us mobile launched this amazing new
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:52.100]   unlimited cell phone plan it's awesome and i put in my referral link but you can only refer like five
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:56.100]   people or something ten people yeah so it's like i need more people's links so i wanted to create a site
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:01.940]   where anyone in our membership could go in and like choose the kind of program and then share their link
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:07.940]   and it would create a url that would cycle between all the members links and i'm not even kidding in
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:15.060]   hours in a day less than a day i built an a full site that allowed people to go set this up i could
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.700]   see analytics i could create these rotating links i could put it with my custom domain i was using replit
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:25.620]   there's a lot of other tools it is wild what you can build now and i remember when i was working
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:30.580]   in venture capital people would email me back oh i have an app idea where do i find a developer and
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:35.060]   there was this window of everyone had ideas but no one knew how to execute on them well now is the
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:42.100]   time that you can go explore that so i think what entrepreneurship looked like 10 20 30 40 years ago
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:49.460]   felt a lot more like quit your job go figure it out maybe even raise some capital and now i want
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.340]   to encourage people to not think the way that it's always seemed because entrepreneurship could be spend
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:51:00.180]   a few hours building a thing and putting it out there i did an episode about buying and selling gold
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:06.500]   right entrepreneurship could be making runs to costco to buy and resell gold go back and listen to an
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.780]   episode i did with kai who runs this podcast called the daily churn and like he makes thousands of
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.020]   dollars a month finding deals and and profiting from them there are a lot of ways that you can
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:23.780]   do this entrepreneurial thing that aren't even companies and i think that's something that's really
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:30.580]   cool because as you said your job and your income is only as stable as as the company is that you work
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:35.300]   for and without getting into politics like there are people who thought government jobs were the
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:40.820]   most secure thing in the world that are learning right now that maybe they're not and so the push
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:47.140]   to find some way not necessarily to replace your entire career replace your job but to just start to
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:53.060]   test the waters and see how you can replace some income not even replace compliment some income but
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:52:00.020]   doing it while being fully aware of what you really care about and what you need so that you don't
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.820]   end up in a place where you're like oh now i have an extra twenty thousand dollars a year let's go buy this
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:10.260]   thing without first thinking gosh would i rather use that twenty thousand dollars a year
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:17.380]   to create a cushion so i can leave my job or to save for the future so that i can be more comfortable
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:23.380]   later but honestly sometimes the answer might be so i can spend more now my interview with bill perkins
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:28.660]   really changed a lot of things talking about die with zero and made me realize maybe i should be spending
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.620]   some of this extra money now instead of saving it for the future and so you just don't know that
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:38.900]   answer until you do the work and some of the work we talked about was on the inside figuring out what
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.540]   you care about who you want to be some of it is how much you have and how much you spend and how much
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:49.780]   you've saved but once you do it you can kind of realize that you're free to make decisions where money
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:56.820]   isn't the the only factor which which it so often is so i love this and i like that the message isn't
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:02.020]   quit your job and go be an entrepreneur and start a company but understand what you care about and see
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:06.340]   if entrepreneurship could be something that's interesting to you and it could be on the side
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.940]   it could be once a month there are a lot of different versions of it yeah i mean everyone's already an
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:14.260]   entrepreneur i mean you're advocating for your own life you're creating your own life and so it's
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:19.060]   really about just taking advantage of the opportunity the moment realizing where entrepreneurship can take
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:25.460]   you the trade-offs that you can make the limits that you can set so you can build a business or make
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:31.860]   money in a way that you want to that doesn't stress you out and you know create all these sort of limits
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.580]   in your life and so yeah it's we just live in a remarkable time if you want to make money and have
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.300]   more freedom and the tools available they're just changing so rapidly for all the doomsdaying out there
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.460]   man it's just such an incredible time to be alive and to be a creator and to be a builder and to be
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.020]   an entrepreneur it's never been easier in history to reach financial independence and reclaim your time
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:55.780]   and build a life you love rewind 50 years ago you know none of this would have been possible right it's
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.140]   like and you just look at how fast the world is changing and it's sort of just like pick the wave
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:07.940]   figure out what you want to do learn how to ride it pay attention be intentional you know open to you
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:14.740]   know yourself to the world and you know it's just an incredible time to to be alive man i think so
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:19.300]   many people just do the thing they've always been doing right and hacking your life is about questioning
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:23.220]   that right it's about saying huh i thought that freedom was this one thing but maybe it's something
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:28.820]   else or i thought that i really loved this job and making five hundred thousand dollars but you know
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.220]   i just had a kid and now i want to really spend more time with my daughter so i don't want to do this
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:38.260]   thing and so paying attention to that and then letting yourself change and moving towards that
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:43.060]   change and embracing that change instead of just sticking to how you've always been and continuing
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:48.740]   to do the thing that you've always done just because it's served you well up to this point it doesn't
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.660]   mean that that's how you should continue to live your life and you mentioned that you spent a lot of
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:59.140]   time you know on your own building that you say no to traveling to lots of events how important do you
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:03.940]   think community is during this whole journey community doesn't have to be big and i think
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:09.620]   we often think that community means having a lot of friends connecting with so many people community
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:14.420]   is about surrounding yourself with people you love who make you feel good who challenge you who you want
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:19.220]   to create with who you want to participate with most of my best friends are people that i build things
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:24.420]   with and that's how i like to spend my time with them whether it's building a company whether it's
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:29.060]   creating a band and so those are the people that i've built around my life there's just really
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.260]   amazing article in the atlantic this month from you know derek thompson i think it's called the anti-social
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.620]   century all about how everyone's so lonely and all these tiktok trends about people being excited when
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.900]   their friends cancel plans with them and you know so we naturally default to being alone in this world
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:50.660]   but i talk in the book about how collaboration is so much more powerful than competition and in fact
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:56.980]   i attribute most of my success online to reaching out to some of my competitors asking them questions
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:02.660]   and then just writing me back and inviting me to chat and me being able to learn from my competition
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:08.420]   and so my creator community you know a lot of them you know historically have been you know my competitors
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:13.060]   and so don't be afraid to reach out to people who are building the thing that you want to be building
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:18.260]   who are in careers similar to your careers and learn from them and then just be very intentional
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.180]   about who you spend your time with and this is important to spend your time with people who make
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:27.060]   you feel good who give you energy don't spend time with people who suck all your energy i know you're
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:31.780]   very very extroverted person i'm an introverted person so i naturally kind of hide behind my computer
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:38.180]   screen and myself but i'm working much harder to surround myself you know with people people that i love
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:44.580]   and um you know that i want to be with so community is is is is essential we're social beings we're pack animals
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:50.420]   you know as as humans we we need to be around other people to survive and to be happy right all that data shows
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:55.380]   that you live longer when you're surrounded by people that you love and so it's important that we find those people
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:00.660]   and that we build those those communities and those networks and you know next time you're sitting in a coffee
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.900]   shop you know take off your headphones and say hi to the person next to you or next time you're on the train
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:09.780]   say hello to the person next to you strike up a conversation because i think the value of sort
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.660]   of random encounters is underestimated and i think it's important for us to to get outside of our phones
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:19.220]   and to to look up and and talk to the people around us in fact you know in columbus ohio you know some
