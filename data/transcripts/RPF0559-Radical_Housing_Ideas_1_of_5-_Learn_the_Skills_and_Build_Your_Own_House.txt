But that's not the situation most likely that you're in or that I'm in. We're in a situation which housing is a big, big deal. And I think a lot about housing because I'm interested in so many different approaches. And I want to give you some ideas that I hope might help you to look at your situation and help to minimize your own housing costs.

So here are some ideas that I, I hope you'll consider if any of them may be practical to you or to anyone you know. The first idea is this. Is there a way that you could learn the skills necessary to construct for yourself an appropriate dwelling and eliminate the need to pay for an expensive dwelling?
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:55.680]   in order to develop for themselves the skills to build their own housing? And they were comparing mathematically the value that they gained from doing that versus the amount of money that they earned from the building.

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.400]   What is the best way to build a property? You can build a property over the course of 30 to 40 hours a week on your own project. Over the course of 1, 2, 3 years, you can build for yourself. Quality housing. And it doesn't have to be weird housing. It can be normal, conventional-looking housing in normal, conventional neighborhoods. There's no reason why you can't go ahead and pool your own permits. There's no reason why you can't do those things yourself. Now let's say it takes you a couple years to get it done. That's fine. But I think it's entirely feasible.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:31.980]  obed to build a house for yourself. Those skills can be so valuable. And you could build for yourself an entirely livable house. It could be conventional or it could be unconventional. That's up to you. But you could build for yourself an entirely workable housing arrangement and do it without borrowing a dime. Do it very inexpensively by putting in your own labor and labor. And that's all.

[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:22.220]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.220]   It's action that leads to a life change. So take action.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.540]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:17:00.900]  , and share it with somebody that you care about. I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share. That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
