[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.840]   memories with your little ones.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.960]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.800]   meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.160]   Today, I begin a five part series with some very short focused shows on some
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960]   different approaches to housing that I hope might give you some creative
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.320]   inspiration to look at your own situation a little bit more thoughtfully.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.640]   If you were to analyze the personal budgets of the average US American, or
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.840]   frankly, the average global citizen, as long as we're talking about a middle
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.040]   class or non-poverty stricken existence, the biggest expense that most of
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.080]   us incur is housing.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.600]   If you're dealing with the very lowest class, the most desperately poor, the
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.480]   biggest expense there is usually food.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.120]   And the housing is extremely makeshift.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.600]   Picture a shanty town with walls and cardboard walls and just a, if fortunate,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   a metal piece of roofing.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.560]   And for the most poor of the world's, for the world's most poor, one of the
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.960]   biggest expenses is food just because they don't even have the money for housing.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.480]   But that's not the situation most likely that you're in or that I'm in.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.040]   We're in a situation which housing is a big, big deal.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.280]   And I think a lot about housing because I'm interested in so many different
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.920]   approaches.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240]   And I want to give you some ideas that I hope might help you to look at your
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.680]   situation and help to minimize your own housing costs.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.200]   There are many ways that you can change the structure and the cost of your
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.760]   housing.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.160]   And I want to encourage you not to be the kind of person who spends all your day
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.960]   working to pay for a house that stays empty most of the time.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.160]   I've interacted and frankly stayed in so many houses where the house was empty
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.000]   during the day because the owners of the house were spending their time going to
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   work to pay for the house that they didn't use.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.840]   And so they got up early and they left the house before breakfast and the house
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.320]   was cold and hot and empty early in the morning.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.160]   And they spent all day out of the house, but at the end of the day, they were so
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120]   tired that instead of coming home and having the energy to actually use the
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.520]   house, they would go out to a restaurant and they would hire people at a
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.720]   restaurant to cook for them, coming home to an empty house, which was heated or
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.080]   cooled all day long for them.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   And they basically used it as a bedroom.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.360]   I've been in so many houses where there's so many different, there's so much space
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.800]   that's unused and it just, it hurts me.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   The efficient side of me hurts me because I want to see that stuff used.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.280]   So here are some ideas that I hope you'll consider if any of them may be
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880]   practical to you or to anyone you know.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.400]   The first idea is this.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.200]   Is there a way that you could learn the skills necessary to construct for
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.000]   yourself an appropriate dwelling and eliminate the need to pay for an expensive
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.640]   dwelling?
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.320]   Years ago, I read an article in, I think it may have been Backwoods Home Magazine.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.520]   I enjoy these Back to the Land magazines, Mother Earth News, Backwoods
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.400]   Home, things like that.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.000]   But years ago, I read an article and the writer of the article was talking about
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.040]   how they had spent time working at basic entry-level jobs in order to develop for
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.200]   themselves the skills to build their own housing.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.160]   And they were comparing mathematically the value that they gained from doing that
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560]   versus the value that they gained from just simply paying a retail cost for a
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.040]   house.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.040]   Now, I didn't sit down and create an elaborate spreadsheet to try to
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.320]   demonstrate this to you before today's show, but I do think it's very worth
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.880]   considering.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.360]   I used to work in the construction trades when I was in high school.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.080]   Primarily, I did some general construction.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.240]   I worked on building a number of houses.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.440]   I was very fortunate and privileged that when I was younger, my parents built their
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.040]   own house.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.320]   And the way that they approached that, one of the reasons they built their own
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.760]   house was so that we children could have a chance to engage with the actual
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.520]   building of that.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   So my dad contracted out the construction of the shell of the house, the walls, the
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.840]   roof, the foundation, et cetera, which is some of the more time-consuming parts.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.040]   But I was involved even as 10 years old, I was involved in many of the aspects of
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.200]   that construction project.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   I nailed a lot of the shingles on the roof.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   I pulled a lot of the wires under the help of, of course, my father who was doing
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   the wiring on the house.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.640]   I observed the process of plumbing.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.400]   I helped and did a little bit of labor in the framing of the walls.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.200]   I watched the guys put up the drywall.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.480]   Now I was limited, of course, due to my age.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   My older brothers did a lot more than I did, but I was very involved in the
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.640]   process.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.120]   I laid a lot of the floor.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.520]   I refinished the floor.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.960]   All of the way through, I was involved in the process.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.440]   And so that exposure to construction gave me a great degree of personal confidence
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   in my ability to tackle and do certain projects.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.280]   When I was in middle school, I worked as a laborer on, again, doing some general
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.880]   carpentry, which was very useful, learning how to frame decks, frame roofs, frame
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.120]   walls, things like that.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.280]   And then also I labored for a summer as a helper for a tile setter.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   And so I spent the summer doing all the jobs that a helper does of mixing up mud
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.000]   and grouting and finishing and chipping up floors, et cetera.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480]   But I learned that I could do tile.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.600]   I could do these, learn these basic skills.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.280]   And I've often thought what a value it would be for a young man or a young woman,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.600]   especially during those high school years to have exposure to these certain trades.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.160]   In hindsight, I could go back and I could see a 14 year old, a 15 year old, a 16
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.040]   year old, a 17 year old, and if that 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 year old were to spend their
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.440]   time each summer working in a different part of the construction industry, just
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.680]   during the summers, they would gain so much skill and competence with regard to
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.080]   carpentry or plumbing or electrical work in order to be able to do it themselves.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.480]   When I was in college, I worked as a helper for somebody who was a master
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.360]   electrician, but was doing the work of putting an addition on their home.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.600]   And I worked at every single stage of that project from digging the foundation.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   We dug it, we compacted it.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.800]   We poured the cement and I gained access to every phase of that construction.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.640]   Here's what I learned.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Construction is actually pretty simple.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.200]   Now, when you're actually working in a trade, you can pick up so much knowledge
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.720]   quickly, much quicker than almost any other, than any other methodology.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   And you can just higher on as an entry level laborer and gain a huge degree of
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.280]   experience as I learned as a seventh grader working as a tile laborer, a helper.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.560]   I gained so much experience just in a couple of months of tile setting.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.200]   So let's say that you're interacting with a 13 year old, a 14 year old, a 15 year
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.880]   old, and let's say that you don't just back into their summer employment by
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.360]   accident, but rather you work into it by design and you break down the major
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   components of construction.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.880]   One might be general carpentry.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   Another might be plumbing, electrical work, perhaps some
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.200]   flooring, perhaps some roofing, perhaps some Finnish carpentry.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.760]   And what if you had two or three or four summers or even better?
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   What if you had multiple month periods for somebody who was homeschooled and
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.600]   they could use their mornings for their, their, their academic work and their
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.880]   afternoons for their physical work.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.000]   Think about how much a focused young person could learn.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.560]   I'm convinced they could come out with a basic knowledge, a working knowledge
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.200]   of most construction techniques with a focused plan, like I've described.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.760]   Even if they worked for free or they worked for 50% less wages, you know,
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.520]   right now to get hired on as a laborer on a construction crew, the going rate
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.760]   is about 15 bucks an hour, at least in most markets where I have seen.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.280]   I was just passing through and I have noticed, which by the way, if you're
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.480]   not employed right now and you want to be employed, you better get out there and get
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:39.960]   a job.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.280]   Unemployment is so low.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.040]   I see help wanted signs everywhere.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.360]   And the starting wage for entry level unskilled work right now seems to be
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.400]   about 13, $14 an hour in the retail environment.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.680]   You go into the construction industry and it's higher.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.920]   So 15 bucks an hour for an entry level helper.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.840]   Maybe it's 12, maybe 13, your market may differ, but about 13, 14, 15 bucks an hour.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   Let's say that you hired on it less.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   Let's say you hired on it 10 because you were utterly unskilled, or let's say
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.920]   you're young and weaker than a strong adult would be, so you're not worth quite
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.560]   as much yet, but you could just learn and get paid to learn.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.800]   You could come out of that type of environment with a huge degree of
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.080]   competence in these basic skills.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.120]   That alone would give you the skills to build your own housing.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.360]   Now here's a second thing to consider.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.920]   There are so many good books and instruction manuals available to you
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.880]   entirely for free at your local library on modern construction techniques.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.040]   There's so many good books on theory available for you that if you have a
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.760]   little bit of basic academic ability, you can work by day helping the electrician
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.680]   and study by night studying electrical theory.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   And in a couple of months of focused effort, you can attain your basic
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   journeyman's level knowledge if you're academically competent.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.680]   Now you won't have the experience requirements to apply for the licensing,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.480]   but you don't need that.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   You just need the knowledge and the theory, and you can do it relatively
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.760]   quickly if you are skilled in this area.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   Which brings me to the third thing, YouTube.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.880]   The power of YouTube and the power of the instructional content for any person
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   to pull out their phone, shoot high quality videos, show what they're doing
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.400]   and give instruction for free is changing so many people's lives.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.320]   From time to time, I come across these news stories and frequently it's
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.280]   somebody who's relatively unlikely, a single mother of three children who
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.880]   built her own house from watching YouTube.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.000]   And I look at these things and I say, absolutely.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.360]   How awesome is that?
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.520]   And it's true.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.200]   It's possible.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.960]   It's doable.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.680]   So why not you?
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.800]   Or why not your children?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.080]   Are your children given over to that type of skillset?
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.560]   Do they have that competence with their hands?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.520]   Do they seem to be able to function well in that environment?
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.840]   If you haven't put them into that environment, why not?
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.400]   Why not give them a chance, give them some exposure?
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:26.080]   There's no reason at all why strong academics and strong physical
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.440]   manual skills shouldn't go together.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.960]   Those things are perfectly compatible, but is that right for you or your children?
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.480]   Could you help a young person to develop those skills?
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.000]   Now, how would you actually apply this?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.760]   Well, let's say that you develop those skills and you were able to work in
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.640]   these jobs and you were able to live cheap, hopefully with mom and dad, but
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.400]   you're able to live cheap and save your money, there's no reason in the world
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.360]   why a 14 year old, a 15 year old, a 16 year old shouldn't be able to put in
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.320]   three, four, five years of strong labor in a manual trade of some kind.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:13.560]   And then by the time they're 18, 19, 20 years old, have 40, 50, 60, $100,000 saved.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.000]   I love the account, the story of Steve Maxwell, who I interviewed on the show
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.960]   and how he's worked with his children, where all of his children were able to
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   save and pay for their first houses, buying them debt free before they were married.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.560]   I love that account.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.720]   There's no reason why you can't do that.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.600]   Now, if you've got 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, $80,000 saved by the time you're 18, 19, 20, 21 years old,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.240]   let's say that you need to pull back to new work 30 hours a week, but you go ahead
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.840]   and put in another 30 to 40 hours a week on your own project over the course of one,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.960]   two, three years, you can build for yourself quality housing.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.440]   And it doesn't have to be weird housing.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   It can be normal, conventional looking housing in normal, conventional neighborhoods.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.440]   There's no reason why you can't go ahead and pull your own permits.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.560]   There's no reason why you can't do those things yourself.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   Now let's say it takes you a couple of years to get it done.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.480]   That's fine.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:21.920]   But I think it's entirely feasible that a motivated, diligent young person or older
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.120]   person for that matter, it's just harder when you gain more responsibility, it's
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.920]   harder to work cheaply so you can gain skill.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.680]   But so this type of approach is I think more well suited for a young person, but
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.040]   there's no reason at all why a young person couldn't come out in their early
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.120]   twenties and construct their entire housing themselves and it'd be beautiful
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:52.520]   and functional, that skill set, those skills can be so valuable and you could
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.640]   build for yourself an entirely livable house.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.840]   It could be conventional or it could be unconventional.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:07.360]   That's up to you, but you could build for yourself an entirely workable housing
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.440]   arrangement and do it without borrowing a dime.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.800]   Do it very inexpensively by putting in your own labor and your own skill.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.680]   Now, given the slower pace, if you start to add the skills of scrounging around
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.360]   for materials, of learning how to work with the things that are less expensive
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.880]   than just everything that is on the retail market, you can do it at a
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.360]   dramatically lower cost.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.880]   So I encourage you, give some thought to this approach, give some thought to
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.200]   these ideas and see if they might not be helpful for you or for a young person
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.880]   that you know.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:53.040]   I know a whole lot of young people, 23 year olds, 25 year olds, 28 year olds,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.520]   who would be a whole lot better off if they had dedicated their
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.960]   teens to this type of approach.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.280]   And instead of working a job that didn't give them physical skills or skills that
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.760]   could be built on to something else, instead of wasting their time doing
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.960]   things that didn't build skills as a young adult, when they have the time
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.800]   to work inexpensively, now a whole lot of them that would be better off
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.040]   following this type of plan.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   So radical housing idea number one is this.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.360]   Could you design the educational program for yourself to learn the skills in
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.880]   order to build your own house?
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.440]   I think you could, if you wanted to.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.680]   Give it a thought, see if that's a helpful idea for you.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.520]   Thank you for listening.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.520]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.320]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.000]   and tactics and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.880]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.200]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show,
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.840]   make a plan to take action on it.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.880]   automatically lead to a life change.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.640]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.400]   So take action.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:18.080]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.000]   with somebody that you care about.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.880]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.920]   message that I'm seeking to share.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.040]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.800]   And it also helps you because teaching others is one of the most effective ways
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.080]   for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.880]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.880]   you're gaining financial benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.800]   if you'd consider paying me for this work voluntarily.
