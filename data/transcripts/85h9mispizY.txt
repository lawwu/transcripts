[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   If you can contract a muscle very hard
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.000]   to the point where it almost feels like it's cramping,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   if you can do that,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.920]   even when there's no weight in your hand
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.840]   or there's no resistance against it,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.000]   so you're just using your mind muscle connection
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   to contract that muscle hard and isolate it,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.600]   chances are you will be able to generate hypertrophy
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.240]   and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720]   compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating.
