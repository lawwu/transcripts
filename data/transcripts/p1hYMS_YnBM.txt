[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580]   I spent a lot of time in proximity to extraordinary wealth.
[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.580]   I know it does not make people happy.
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.500]   And just because you've got hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.260]   or billions of dollars does not make for a healthy,
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.140]   flourishing, holistic life.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.220]   Somebody always had a more beautiful girlfriend
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.420]   who was more famous.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.300]   Somebody always had a better car, a better plane.
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.920]   If I was with a group of people
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.520]   gambling $10,000 a hand at blackjack,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.700]   somebody else was gambling 100,000 a hand.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.900]   It was this insatiable lust for more,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.260]   but there was no end point.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.140]   I think looking back at that,
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.860]   there was never going to be enough.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.580]   And in fact, I still know people who are out at the clubs
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.980]   and they are now dating girls younger than their daughters.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.020]   Just continually looking for more, looking for more,
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.100]   looking for those markers of success,
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.380]   knowing that somebody's always got
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.740]   a little bit more than you.
