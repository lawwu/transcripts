[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I'm going to sell you a disability insurance policy.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.840]   Now hold on.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.760]   You don't have to hold on to your checkbook too tightly.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.500]   Unfortunately for me, I dumped my insurance license so I can't actually collect the
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.160]   commissions on it or on the many policies that I would sell if I actually were still
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   selling them.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.800]   But I'm going to do my best to actually enforce the concept today because I'm pretty
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   hardcore passionate about disability insurance.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.920]   I believe it's the most important insurance that you could own.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.080]   And I promise I'll defend that claim in today's show.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.880]   And I just think it's something that any intelligent thinking person who works should
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880]   have.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:01:02.600]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.320]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.560]   This is the show where we work hard to provide you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.920]   encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while also building a
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920]   plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   But you know what?
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.720]   That plan is predicated usually upon your ability to work.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.160]   So today, a little bit of knowledge about what to do if you can't work.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.640]   I received an email from a listener a few weeks ago and they said, "Joshua, I've
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.520]   heard you make this statement several times on different shows that you really think disability
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   insurance is important.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.280]   In fact, you think it's the most important insurance that I could own.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040]   And so I was thinking about getting some.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I went to your website and I was looking through the archives for a show on disability
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.800]   insurance and I didn't see a show on disability insurance.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.920]   Can you help?"
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.160]   And I said, "Yeah, that's actually my fault.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.280]   I haven't actually created that show."
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.720]   So here we are about 350 episodes in and it's time to create this show on disability insurance.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.880]   And this show will be a series of shows, especially this week and more in the future.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.480]   I've been remiss in not getting it done sooner, but I'm happy to bring it to you.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.160]   And today, we're going to kick it off with the sales job.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   Because here's the thing with insurance.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.400]   Insurance has to be sold.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.840]   I don't know why more people don't think about stuff that could happen and go out seeking
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.880]   for it.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.800]   But the whole concept of insurance, many people have a grudge against insurance.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.640]   They don't like spending the money on the premiums.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.500]   They love to collect the checks when they come in, but they don't love buying the policies.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.040]   Most of us, if we had our way, we'd probably skip all insurance and we'd probably skip
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.720]   most of the insurance that we have now if we didn't – hadn't been sold it.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Why that is, I don't know.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.880]   I share that same feeling.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.440]   I don't love insurance in the sense that I don't love writing those premium checks.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.880]   But when the policies pay out, they're useful to have and it's one of those things that
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.840]   you just kind of got to recognize.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.600]   So because we got to start with a sale, I first got to do my job of motivating you to
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.520]   want disability insurance.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.800]   Because if I don't do a job of motivating you to want disability insurance, it doesn't
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.480]   matter any of the technical specifications that we're going to go through.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   I'm going to go through a lot of them.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.360]   We'll go through long-term disability versus short-term disability.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.880]   We'll go through employer-paid – excuse me, group disability at your job versus personal
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   disability insurance.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.200]   We'll go through whether or not you should pick up the money for the premiums in your
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   income or not.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.800]   We'll go through own occupation and any occupation.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   We'll go through the different terms of disability.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   We'll go through the different timing of the policies, how long they last.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.640]   We'll go through a bunch of those things to try to give you a good understanding of
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   the disability insurance marketplace.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.500]   But today, I just want to sell you on the concept and I want to talk to you about why
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.800]   I think it's important.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.680]   I really do believe that disability insurance is the most important insurance policy that
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   you can buy.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   I mean it.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.760]   I believe it's the most important insurance policy that you can buy.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.680]   To prove that point, I want to start by talking to you about which of your assets are most
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   important to you.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   So we're going to play a little game here.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.640]   I'm going to give you a question and you're going to think of the answer.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   Unfortunately, I can't hear the answer but I'm going to give you time to come up with
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   it.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   So here's the game.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   I want you to stop mentally.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.280]   If you're driving in the car, you can keep driving.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.480]   But just think for a moment about all the different assets on your balance sheet.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.160]   Most of you have listened to the show for a while.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.600]   Hopefully, you've gone and created a balance sheet so you could pull it up on your phone
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.480]   and show it to me if you wanted it.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.160]   So think about all of the different assets that are on your balance sheet.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.620]   Think of that list of assets on your balance sheet and tell me which of those assets is
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.480]   the most important.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.240]   Which asset is the most important?
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   I could also ask you the question and say, "Okay, of those assets on your balance sheet,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.880]   which one is the biggest?"
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.960]   Because when we start to think about protecting an asset with insurance, we want to think
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   about it in the context of protecting the most important assets first.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   For example, your balance sheet most likely doesn't have something like a cell phone
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.180]   on it.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.520]   But most of you have a cell phone.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.200]   The majority of you who are listening to the sound of my voice right now are gaining that
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.400]   – are accessing my audio file through the use of a mobile device of some sort.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.140]   Now most of you probably paid a couple hundred bucks for that mobile device depending on
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.640]   which type it is.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.060]   Well, that's a useful and important asset.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.800]   And some of you have insurance on that asset.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.600]   That might make sense in certain contexts.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.860]   It might not make sense in other contexts.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.680]   But the way that we would figure that out is largely based upon how much we paid for
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   the device.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560]   So for example, I have a cell phone.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.040]   It's a pretty fancy cell phone.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.200]   It's basically a $1,000 phone.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   I have an iPhone 6S Plus with the way overpriced Apple memory that they give you, the high
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   end.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   So basically it's a $1,000 phone.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.000]   Well, that $1,000 phone, if that thing broke or became inoperable, I'd be hurting a little
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   bit.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.560]   I don't like to throw $1,000 around and waste it.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   So should I put insurance on it?
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.880]   Well, we could make a much higher argument for the benefit of putting insurance on it
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.240]   if I paid $1,000 for it than if I paid $100 for a phone.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.880]   It would be a much bigger deal.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.120]   So should I put insurance on it?
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   The point here is just simply to point out that bigger assets require insurance policies
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.280]   or at least lead to considering more seriously getting an insurance policy.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.480]   So think back to that list of assets.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   What asset did you list?
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:08.680]   Well, most of you, your house would probably be the largest dollar value asset on your
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.720]   list of assets.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   So many of you would put your house as number one.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.400]   Your house is a pretty important thing.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.640]   It's kind of hard to be without it.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   It's pretty tough.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.880]   I've been watching over the last few weeks these fires that have been happening in Alberta,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.920]   in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, and it's pretty devastating to see thousands of people
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.720]   lose their homes.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Pretty devastating.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.040]   So the house is obviously important.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.680]   Some of you might list your car.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.920]   Maybe you rent a house and you say you don't have that on your balance sheet but you have
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   your car there.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.440]   Well, is your car the most important asset?
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.680]   Many of you are diligent savers.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.920]   You have savings accounts and investment accounts.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.840]   Perhaps even those accounts are much bigger than your house.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.760]   So perhaps those are the most important assets.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:04.240]   But there are a couple of assets that usually most people don't think to put onto this list.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.520]   If I were sitting in front of you in a sales situation which I were actually selling you
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.960]   a disability insurance policy, I would have put these assets on the list and I would have
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.680]   asked you to order these assets in order of most important to least important.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   I would have written down your house, your car, your savings, and your investments and
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.160]   would have added these two assets, your health and your income.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.800]   Now obviously these aren't exactly the same and we don't generally write down your health
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.200]   on your balance sheet.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.640]   Usually you wouldn't accurately at least following normal rules of accounting, you wouldn't actually
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.780]   list the value of your income on a balance sheet.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.380]   So it's a little bit unfair of me to phrase the question I did.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.560]   But are these not assets that should be on a mental balance sheet?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.160]   I've done this little exercise thousands – not thousands, hundreds of times.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.920]   I've done this exercise hundreds of times and with many different people from many walks
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.080]   of life and usually when I put this list of five or six assets in front of people and
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.180]   I give them a pen and I ask them to order and rank the assets in order of most important,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:18.440]   most people start off with their house just like I did in my example.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.620]   And then they get down to that health and that income one and the way I used to do this
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.540]   in a sales presentation was I wouldn't try to – it's not a leading question.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.640]   I would just say, "What's the most important?
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.860]   Put a one by it.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.860]   OK.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.860]   Now what next?
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.860]   What next?"
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.260]   And I would force people to go through the whole list.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.340]   After going through the whole list down by the time they reach their health and income,
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.580]   they always stop and they say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.580]   Actually, these are important."
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.140]   And almost without exception, people would come out and realize and recognize that their
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:56.500]   health is their number one most important asset followed quickly by their income.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:04.260]   The reason is because of what your health and your income contribute to those other
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.040]   assets.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.660]   Your health is what enables you to earn an income.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.520]   Your health is what gives you the ability to go to work, to go to your job or to run
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   your business.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.940]   That's all based upon your health.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.460]   Without that health, it's hard to keep a job down.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.780]   So your health allows you to create an income and then the income is what actually pays
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.860]   for all of those other things.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:38.260]   Because most of those assets that we list on our balance sheet are actually – if we
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.140]   were to follow Robert Kiyosaki's ideas from Rich Dad, Poor Dad, they're actually liabilities
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.320]   in the sense that they pull money from our budget.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.540]   The only exception to that would be savings and investments.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.660]   But our houses, most of them for most of us, they pull income from our budget.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.300]   They require upkeep and maintenance and mortgage payments and tax payments.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.020]   Our cars, they pull income from our budget.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.380]   Not very fun.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:09.180]   So those assets are actually dependent upon our income for us to keep them going.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:16.220]   Now, health is definitely number one for most of us.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.260]   Health is something that we often take for granted.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:27.460]   I'd like to challenge that for a moment and encourage you to constantly consider it.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.780]   If you have health, you can earn income.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:37.060]   If you can't earn income, then you will quickly lose the rest of your things.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:43.180]   Question, would you rather have tons of money and no health or would you rather have great
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.540]   health and no money?
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   Think about it.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:56.300]   I magically transport you into a million-dollar mansion on the water and you are financially
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300]   independent.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.980]   You have income that shows up, pays all of your bills and you're lying there flat on
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.860]   your back in that mansion with a bald head because you're going through chemotherapy
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.740]   and radiation for cancer treatments and you don't have the energy to get out of bed by
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.740]   yourself.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.780]   But you're in a million-dollar mansion and all your bills are paid.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.100]   So you lie there in your bed and you look out at the water.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:30.580]   Would you rather be in that situation or would you rather be fit, healthy, filled with energy,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:38.380]   active, vibrant, flexible, strong and just not have any money to your name?
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.500]   I often go down to the beaches here in the area and I always notice there's some people
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.580]   hanging out at the beaches that seem to be there every day.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.100]   And you can go down and you can hang out as a poor person and walk on the same beach that
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.180]   the rich person's house overlooks.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.260]   If you're active and you're healthy, you can go and jump in on a volleyball game and if
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.740]   you're active and you're healthy, you can bum a little food off of people and if you're
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   an interesting conversationalist, they'll be happy to invite you in and you don't even
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   have to pay for it.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.420]   It's a pretty good deal.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.900]   If I'm active and healthy, I can enjoy the day and the simple pleasures of the day to
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.540]   a far higher extent than if I'm unhealthy.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.900]   Now I'm not saying that you have to choose between poverty and health.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.700]   If you have health, you can actually earn money.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.060]   And think about how many incredible ways there are to earn money if you're healthy.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:43.980]   From time to time in the past, I'd go out and rent a drift boat, go out on a fishing
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.980]   charter here in South Florida where I live.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.780]   I got a few friends that are commercial fishermen.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.740]   I've gone out with them fishing for the day.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   I think about commercial fishing because on these drift boats where you're basically for
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:59.140]   tourists and people who want to go out for a day, there are always a couple of deckhands.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.900]   And it's their job to bait the hooks and help people take the fish off their hooks and just
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:13.460]   basically be deckhands to help the tourists and the non-fishing natives with their fishing
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.460]   excursion.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.460]   I think about things like that.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.460]   I just think, you know what?
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.660]   That's a really satisfying job to some degree.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.940]   You're out in the sunshine.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.820]   You're helping people have fun.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.980]   You're fishing.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.180]   You're enjoying the emotion of it.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.180]   What's required of it?
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.180]   Well, you got to get up early.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.180]   You got to be out in the sunshine.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.540]   You got to scrub the boat down at the end of the day.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.540]   But you know what?
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.940]   If you're out on a lot of friends' boats and they're out enjoying their expensive boat
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.100]   because they have very lucrative careers and they have a beautiful sport fishing boat,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.300]   guess what you got to do?
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   You got to get up early.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.780]   You got to go out in the sunshine.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.260]   You got to throw a hook in the water and you got to clean up the deck when you're on your
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.820]   way back and scrub the boat down.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.980]   So does it really matter whether you're doing it on your own boat that you worked and saved
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.620]   for years or whether you're doing it as a deckhand at a relatively lowly paid job on
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.540]   a commercial fishing boat?
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.900]   It's the same work.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:11.580]   The person who's in good health can enjoy both of those things.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:18.580]   So not only is health generally – does that not lead to a better life and a better lifestyle
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.640]   versus sickness.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.340]   So even if you were poor, it's OK.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.340]   It's better at least.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.180]   Better to be healthy and poor than rich and sick.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.100]   That's also what allows you to earn money and there are so many great ways to earn money.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:43.660]   See, health allows you to create income and income allows you to build wealth.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.180]   But if you lose your health, people will happily spend every dollar they have to try to get
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.220]   their health back.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.820]   You ask a sick person what they want most, it's to get their health back.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:03.900]   So there's a little encouragement for all of us to focus on our health and to make that
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.460]   a priority.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.780]   Now is our health entirely under our control?
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.980]   No, it's not.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.900]   To some degree, we influence it.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:22.700]   We can make certain choices and decisions that will help but it's not under our control.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.780]   Man is so incompetent and impotent that he can't even keep himself alive or healthy
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.140]   if he wanted to.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.900]   Again, you can do your best but you don't necessarily have that choice all the time.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.780]   There are things that happen that result in our not having health.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.220]   Well what's worse than being healthy and broke?
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.380]   Being sick and broke is worse.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.780]   So what happens if you lose your health and you can no longer earn money?
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.220]   Well, that's where disability insurance comes in.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.180]   That's the job that disability insurance is designed to do.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:05.580]   It's designed to help provide income to pay your bills if you lose your health.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.700]   So back to that list of assets, how important is this list?
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.420]   Well let's say I own a house and pretend it's a $250,000 house.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.980]   Probably have a mortgage on it, have a pretty healthy balance if I were reflective of most
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.980]   people.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.900]   That's a sizable asset though.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.740]   The car, maybe I have a $20,000 car.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.540]   Maybe I have $50,000 in my savings and investment accounts.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.100]   But what's the value of my income?
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.980]   People often neglect to calculate the value of their potential income.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.700]   Let's pretend you're 35 years old and let's pretend that you intend to work till 65.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.140]   So you've got a 30-year career ahead of you.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:53.580]   Assume you're earning $60,000 per year and that you anticipate a 3% increase each year
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.140]   to keep pace with inflation.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.380]   Do you know what the actual value is of that income?
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.380]   The answer is $2,854,524.94.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:11.620]   We'll round that to just under $3 million.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:20.260]   Almost everybody listening to this show has a potential income of perhaps $2 million.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.700]   Some of you it's a million, some of you it's two, some of you it's 10 or some of you it's
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.880]   50.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.660]   But just about everybody has a potential income of at least a couple million.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:36.460]   Even if you were to go to work at 45 or 50 years old and work for a decade or two, you
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.940]   still are looking at a million or $2 of income.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.620]   That's a huge, huge dollar figure.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.180]   So if we actually write that on the income, on the list of assets, when you write down
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.020]   $3 million, for most of us, that totally dwarfs everything else.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.080]   When I used to do this face-to-face with prospective clients, I would first love to point out the
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.180]   fact that – because I always created the balance sheet and then I would point out the
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.180]   value of this income.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:10.260]   I would say, "Listen, you are going to earn $3 million over the course of your lifetime.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.540]   Now you're looking over here and you got $10,000 of credit card debt and you got $14,000
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.220]   that you owe on your car and you got $22,000 of student loans and $142,000 mortgage.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.620]   And you're feeling really upset and frustrated about that.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620]   That's okay.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:33.260]   But look, you've got $3 million over here that I expect you to earn over the next 30
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   years.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.800]   $3 million."
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:42.020]   Now do you think that it's possible that you could put some of this $3 million and
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.660]   clear the credit card debt, clear the car payment, clear the student loans, pay off
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.260]   the mortgage and possibly save a few hundred thousand or a million or two bucks?
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.500]   I mean you put it into context, yes.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.820]   The answer is always yes.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.400]   You could do that.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.060]   So what stands in the way?
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:06.580]   Well, behavior, which is the most challenging thing for all of us to control, behavior.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.240]   Because in order for me to actually do that, to pay off the car, I have to not go and immediately
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.760]   finance a new car.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.500]   In order to do that and pay off the credit cards, I have to not immediately go and put
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.860]   more money on the credit cards.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.940]   But when you look at it in the big picture and compare the $3 million to the things that
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.900]   stress us out today, that should give most people some hope.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.960]   Now let's talk about it financially.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.620]   Think about the amount of money that you pay to insure these things.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.140]   The way I used to do this with clients and I invite you to picture it in your head was
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.340]   I would draw a little picture of your car on the left-hand side of a paper right in
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.340]   front of you.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.540]   Draw a little picture of your car and I would know by this time in the discussion, I would
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.900]   know how much your car were worth.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.540]   So let's say it's worth $20,000.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.460]   Ask you how much you're paying for car insurance.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460]   Paying $100 a month.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:02.500]   So I would write $20,000 over the car and I would write $1,200 underneath it, $1,200
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.940]   a year.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.380]   Then I would draw a picture of your house and by this time in the conversation, I know
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.660]   how much it were worth.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.060]   So I'd write down $250,000 and ask how much you're paying for homeowner's insurance,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.980]   $3,000 a year.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.140]   So I'd write $3,000 a year under that.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.020]   Then I would keep both of those pictures pretty small.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.380]   Then I would draw this huge box, this big, big box and I would write in there and I would
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:37.260]   do the math for them, $60,000 times 30 years, 3% to 5% increase in annual pay and I would
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.380]   put a range on there.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.380]   But I would write down $3 million.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.580]   I'd do my best to make it comparative, to show you how huge your income is compared
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.340]   to everything else.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.660]   Then I'd draw a little line under it and I'd ask my good sales question, "How much is that
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.980]   worth to you to protect?"
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:10.340]   I invite you to consider it because you pay $1,200 a year to insure a car and you do that
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.100]   because the government makes you do it.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.660]   But the car is worth $20,000 and you pay $3,000 a year to put insurance on your house.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.140]   You do that because the mortgage company makes you do it.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:35.020]   But yet you've got a $3 million asset that you don't have insurance on?
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.900]   Seems a little silly to me.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:46.340]   Now that should, I hope, set the stage for you to consider the value of disability income
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.300]   insurance.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.220]   There are lots of other statistics and things that you could go to.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.620]   When I was a new insurance agent, I memorized all these numbers about the rates of morbidity
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.380]   versus the rates of mortality.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.620]   Morbidity means getting sick and how likely you were to get sick and hurt at any specific
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.380]   age and I memorized all these things.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.780]   I used to use all these charts and graphs.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.780]   Finally, I threw all that stuff away and just drew pictures for people.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:17.940]   I hope that I've drawn a mental picture for you to simply demonstrate that it's really
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.500]   important.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   Again, what's worse than having no health?
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.780]   Having no health and having no income.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.660]   Because you're spending your money trying to get your health back, well how are you
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   going to live?
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:43.260]   That's why I personally believe that if I could only choose to have one type of insurance,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:50.660]   I would choose long-term disability income insurance over any other type of insurance.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:57.300]   Because that's the one that will make the biggest difference in my life if I face a
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.900]   worst case scenario.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.140]   Let's talk about it.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.860]   Let's say that I get diagnosed with cancer.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.100]   I've had for a long time, I've had an outline here of doing a show.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.940]   I haven't done it but basically it was inspired by a listener who about a year ago wrote to
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.860]   me and said, "Joshua, I had heard you talk about getting disability insurance.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   I never did it.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.980]   I just want to let you know I have cancer."
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.100]   We corresponded a little bit and he told me all the details of his life.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.820]   I've been intending to do a show, what do you do when you get diagnosed with cancer?
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.700]   He's a young man, similar in age to me.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.500]   Thankfully, he's doing better now.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.900]   Cancer seems to be in remission, just finished up the final stage of his treatment.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.020]   But it's been a difficult road for him.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.780]   Let's talk about that.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.620]   Let's say that I all of a sudden found out that I were diagnosed with cancer.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.340]   Let's start with the simple ones.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.020]   I have a house and I have homeowner's insurance on it.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:04.180]   Well, if I'm going through cancer, how am I going to pay the homeowner's insurance if
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.300]   I don't have income?
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.740]   Even if I have homeowner's insurance, I can't even keep it because I'm not going to be able
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.820]   to make the payment if I don't have income and don't have savings.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.620]   Same thing with car insurance and those types of property insurances.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.300]   If I don't have income and I have cancer and I can't work, and this listener of mine was
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.620]   an accountant, he couldn't work.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.100]   I'll cover the objections, people, reasons people don't get disability insurance in a
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.260]   minute.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:37.820]   But he was an accountant, he couldn't work.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.540]   So it's kind of pointless to have property insurance when I can't even keep the property
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:48.300]   insurance in force and I probably can't even keep the property if I don't have any income.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.500]   So car insurance and homeowner's insurance are pretty easy.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.900]   Well, what about life insurance?
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.460]   Would I rather choose to have life insurance or disability insurance?
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.980]   Frankly, if I could only choose one, I'd rather have disability insurance.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.860]   Here's why.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:19.100]   If I get sick or hurt and I die, is that going to be tough on my family?
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.660]   Without question, yes.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.740]   That will be very tough on my family.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:31.440]   If I have no savings and no insurance, it will be very, very difficult.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.060]   If I have a wife and young kids, it would be tough.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   But you know what?
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.060]   They'd make it.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   How do I know that?
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.020]   Well, there's people who face this all throughout history, who face it all the time.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.980]   My wife would go and get a job.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.860]   There are hundreds of thousands of single moms supporting single-handedly, either because
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.180]   they were abandoned by their children's father or because their child's father's children's
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.180]   father died.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.520]   There are hundreds of thousands of single moms working and supporting children.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.420]   There are social support structures that would step in and help out.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:14.540]   There would be a social security widow and orphan payment for my children, guaranteed.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.240]   So they would have some minimum level of income.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.000]   Because I'm dead and gone, my family can work out whatever living arrangements need to be
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.440]   worked out in order for them to be able to make it financially.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.100]   They could sell the house if we owned a house.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.120]   They could move to a cheaper apartment.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   They could move in with family.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:38.360]   If my wife had to move in with her parents or my parents or a family member of some kind,
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   this is normal.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.000]   This is how these situations work.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.440]   Because I'm dead and I'm gone, she's free to step in and take over the work, take over
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.840]   the financial responsibility.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.080]   She can do that.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.000]   And because I'm dead and gone, my expenses have stopped.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.640]   She doesn't have to feed me.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.920]   She doesn't have to clothe me.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.400]   She doesn't have to cart me around.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   She doesn't have to have an extra car for me.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   Simple.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.440]   Now, let's flip it.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:13.560]   Let's say that instead of me being dead, I'm just simply pretty sick.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.040]   Well, now what?
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.840]   Well, now none of those things happens.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.920]   I forgot to say my wife could remarry.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.280]   She could find someone else and marry somebody else who would be able to help support her
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   and the children.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:32.760]   Well, if I'm sick, she can't do that.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   She's still stuck with me.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.080]   My wife and I kind of made an agreement that until death do us part, so she's stuck with
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   me.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.760]   We said in sickness and in health, so she's stuck with me.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.160]   What about our living expenses?
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.840]   Well, it's kind of hard to sell the house when you're dealing with a sick husband.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.080]   Kind of hard to move apartments when you've got to figure out how do we take care of this
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.120]   person's medical care.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   There's no income coming in.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.760]   Is it possible to get social security disability?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   It's possible.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.360]   I highly recommend you never, ever plan on getting it.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.160]   You've got to be really, really disabled to get it.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:18.480]   You've got to be disabled for a while and there's got to be almost no chance of you're
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.040]   ever getting better.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.120]   I have worked with some people in social security disability claims, people who are without
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.840]   question utterly entitled to those benefits the way the law is written.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.920]   It has been a nightmare to get it.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.000]   Guess what?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.240]   When you get it, it ain't much, especially if you're young.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.080]   A friend of mine that tries to live on about $600 a month to support herself because she
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.440]   got social security disability, fought it for years to finally get it.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.120]   If anyone is disabled, she is disabled.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.400]   Very difficult situation.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.920]   So let's just assume there's no social security disability payments.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.160]   I could get into the technical reasons of why if those of you who want to nitpick me
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.880]   about that, but just take my word for it.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   You've got to be very disabled.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.840]   You've got to be totally disabled, unable to do any gainful employment for an expected
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.000]   period of a very long time.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.120]   So what are the options?
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.960]   If we have no income, how is she going to – she's got to go to work?
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   Who is going to take care of me?
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.760]   Who is going to take care of the kids?
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.560]   Well, family can step in and that's always what happens.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.720]   But the point is it's far easier on her if I'm dead and gone than if I'm simply
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.120]   disabled.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.560]   Disability is much more difficult on her because now she goes and gets a job.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.880]   Family steps in, takes care of me.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   Well, guess what?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.320]   She's got to go take a job and then when she comes home, she's got to take care of
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.280]   me and she's got to take care of kids.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.960]   So instead of two kids and a husband to help her with, now she's got two kids and a third
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.840]   kid, meaning me, who's more work than any of the kids.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   Very, very difficult.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.040]   So I'd rather have disability insurance than life insurance if I could only choose
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   one.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.280]   What about health insurance?
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.200]   Well, health insurance is really useful.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.600]   And if you have great health insurance, it's possible that that could entitle you to great
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.760]   medical care.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   But you know what?
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.200]   If you're broke, we've got a whole system of Medicaid that's designed to pay for that.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.360]   Is it going to be the best care that you could possibly get?
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.680]   It's always been a hard question for me to answer.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.800]   My experience has been you're going to get care no matter how broke and bankrupt you
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   are.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.360]   And we've decided this is an important program.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   The program is there.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   It pays for it.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   So you're going to get Medicaid even if you don't have any money.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.720]   You're going to get medical care if you don't have any health insurance.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.840]   Let's say you don't get Medicaid.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.080]   Let's say you just pile up a million dollars of medical bills.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:54.800]   There's bankruptcy courts to help you get out of those debts.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.480]   Or after you get better, you can work with the creditors.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.720]   You can work to negotiate them and you can work to pay them back.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:07.880]   So if you have giant bills, giant medical bills, you can deal with those things.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.240]   But you know what's really difficult to deal with?
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   A landlord.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.080]   He's kicking you out of an apartment.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.160]   A mortgage company that's foreclosing on your house while you're also dealing with the medical
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.960]   bills because your income is not just for you.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.180]   Your income is also for your family.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.360]   You might be in the hospital or you might not be in the hospital.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.240]   But if you're not in the hospital, how are you going to pay your rent if you can't work?
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.520]   You're just trying to recover at home.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.280]   So if I had to choose between health insurance and disability insurance, I'll take the disability
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.200]   payments.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.280]   The health insurance I can deal with at a future time.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   The health bills and all those things, I can deal with those.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.040]   When I'm better or if I'm not better, I can't deal with them.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.840]   And I'll say thank you very much to the creditors.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   I can't pay you.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   What can we do?
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.160]   And I'll work that out.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.760]   But if I have at least $3,000 a month or $2,000 a month or $20,000 a month, whatever the number
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.280]   is of disability, then I can possibly keep my mortgage paid and keep from getting foreclosed
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   on.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.600]   I can possibly keep some rent coming in.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.640]   I can possibly have enough money to buy some groceries.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.280]   I could possibly have enough money to keep the car going to be able to maintain some
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.600]   semblance of normal life.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.240]   And the cool thing about disability payments is legally in most states, they're going to
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   be entitled to protection.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.720]   So your creditors are not going to be able to come after disability payments in most
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   states that I'm aware of.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:42.240]   However, practically, it's pretty easy to evade those who would seek to attach that
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   money.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.840]   If you just have an income, that's a contract between you and the insurance company.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   You can get that income and you can pay your bills the same day, the bills that you need
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.120]   to be able to stay in your house and you can be in good shape.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.880]   So I'll take the disability insurance.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.880]   What else?
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   Long-term care insurance?
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.320]   These usually function and complement.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   Disability insurance usually goes away and long-term care insurance kicks in at the end
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   of life.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   But guess what?
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   If I'm needing long-term care, I'm disabled.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   I'm disabled.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.280]   So if I need long-term care as a 30-year-old, that's a situation that would pay out under
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.760]   the context of a long-term care policy or also under a disability policy.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   So I truly believe that disability insurance is more important than all of the other insurances.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.480]   Now the cool thing about insurance is generally, it's pretty inexpensive.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:39.000]   Disability insurance costs more than term life insurance, usually not nearly as expensive
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.280]   as health insurance.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.280]   It varies depending on how you compare it to long-term care insurance.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:51.400]   It's going to come out to be 1%, 2% or 3% of your income depending on what type of policy
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:58.000]   you buy, what policy design constraints you put into it, what type of occupation you have,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.080]   safe occupation, not safe occupation, etc.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.360]   So it's super, super important.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.440]   I hope that's persuasive to you.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:15.480]   That is probably more important than some of the other insurances that you have.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.440]   Now does everybody need disability insurance?
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.480]   My answer, no, absolutely not.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   People who are financially independent don't need disability insurance.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.160]   If you or your family is not dependent on your income to maintain your lifestyle, you
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.400]   don't need disability insurance.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.320]   You might still choose to have it.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.280]   I think there's a compelling argument to be made to have it, especially when you get into
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.200]   it from the perspective of trying to protect very high incomes.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.680]   People who have invested years of work in their education and years of work in establishing
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.480]   their career to build a very high income usually have an appreciation for the value of that
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.720]   income.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:10.320]   Usually this comes in with highly compensated physicians, very knowledgeable and very inclined
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.240]   to have disability insurance, highly compensated professions like attorneys, things like that.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.360]   These people are usually open and much more interested in having disability insurance.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.440]   For physicians it's generally considered to be mandatory, perhaps because they work with
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.320]   a lot of sick people, who knows.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.480]   But it's a big deal to have it.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.020]   But you don't need it if you're financially independent.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:41.480]   So if you are retired or you could retire without any impact to your lifestyle, you
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.800]   don't need disability insurance.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.640]   The rest of us need to think about it.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.440]   Now why don't people get disability insurance?
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.200]   There are a few reasons.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.160]   First, many people can't get disability insurance.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.320]   They can't get disability insurance because of medical reasons.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:09.400]   They might have had a previous situation that resulted in them being sick in the past.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.880]   Disability insurance underwriting can be very challenging.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.640]   All kinds of little things can come into play.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.920]   I had many, many people declined.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.520]   I had many people experience problems in underwriting because they have to be very, very careful.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.840]   You have the possibility – the probability of adverse selection against the insurance
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840]   company.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.440]   So people who have been injured in the past are much more motivated to get the insurance
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.780]   than those who haven't.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.860]   Same problem they face with health insurance.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.560]   People who have been sick in the past are the first people to sign up and say, "Yeah,
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   give me health insurance."
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.960]   People who are healthy usually don't want to spend the money.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.760]   So they got to deal with adverse selection.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.280]   It can be difficult for some people to get with a medical history.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.080]   It can also be difficult to get with certain occupations.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.240]   There are many occupations that are simply not insurable for disability insurance, at
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.320]   least not by commercial companies.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.920]   You have to work really hard sometimes to get certain types of coverage.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.140]   Now a knowledgeable insurance broker should be able to shop – if you are looking for
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.560]   disability insurance, a knowledgeable insurance broker should be able to shop you around to
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.920]   a bunch of different companies.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.420]   What you will find is that there are different companies who specialize in different occupations.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.980]   There are some companies that will not accept anybody in this occupation.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.560]   But there are other companies that will do a great job in that occupation.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.680]   You would be surprised at where these lines fall.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:43.120]   For example, when I was with – the company I was with didn't insure chiropractors,
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.560]   just flat out refused to accept chiropractors.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.440]   So you get into certain medical specialties and these jobs are simply not insurable.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.680]   So many people have trouble because of their occupation.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.640]   Many people have trouble because of their hobbies, their avocations.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:04.000]   If you're jumping out of airplanes or flying airplanes, things like that, those can result
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.560]   in difficulty getting disability insurance.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.760]   Many people have trouble getting disability insurance because of financial qualifications.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.520]   That can be a few things.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.560]   First, you have to qualify based upon your income and some people have group benefits,
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   things like that.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.400]   So they are going to deal with what they have at their group.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.520]   Many entrepreneurs and self-employed people have a very difficult time getting disability
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   insurance.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.000]   They can't get disability insurance right now, new business.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.760]   New business has to – you have to show your earnings record.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:45.000]   One of the challenges that entrepreneurs face and people who are business owners is the
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.640]   amount of income that they show on their tax return and the amount of income that they
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.160]   actually experience are usually two different numbers.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.480]   The disability insurance underwriter is going to go based upon your profits.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.040]   So when we talk about strategies to show a lower income in order to save on taxes, that's
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.820]   really great when it comes to taxes.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.000]   But that hurts you when you go to apply for a mortgage and it hurts you when you go to
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.800]   apply for disability insurance.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.320]   But many times, the reasons people just don't buy disability insurance is because they're
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   apathetic.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.360]   They've already spent and allocated the money to something else.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.120]   It's very challenging to get a normal middle class family to – who's not accustomed
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:34.360]   to buying disability insurance to happily and eagerly fork over $250 or $300 or $350
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.880]   a month.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.640]   Very challenging from a sales perspective.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.160]   Many people, even though they buy everything that I said and they said, "Yeah, I get
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.320]   it," and you can look at statistics until you're blue in the face.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.240]   That's why I just don't even bother going to the numbers.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.560]   But you can look at those things until you're blue in the face and it's $300 a month or
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.960]   it's $200 a month or it's $150 a month.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.320]   Then what's often is men.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.720]   Men are the worst and I get all these stupid excuses.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.040]   The standard two excuses is that men give.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   Usually women are much smarter.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.400]   In fact, women are much more likely to get – excuse me.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   Men are like – yeah.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   Women are more likely to get disabled than are men.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.080]   Men are less likely to get disabled.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.520]   Men die sooner but men are less likely to get disabled than women.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:27.680]   So for women, your disability insurance actually will cost you more than for men.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.520]   For men, life insurance costs more than for a woman.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.920]   For a woman, disability insurance costs more.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.960]   But for men, the standard two things is, "I'll work even though I'm sick."
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   You heard it every single time.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.940]   "I'll work even though I'm sick."
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.280]   If you're a man and you're listening and you have that consideration, I just ask you,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.720]   have you ever been sick and not felt like going to work?
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.000]   Most of us have.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Sometimes you just can't work.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.440]   Sometimes you do your best.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.320]   Sometimes you can't work.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.400]   You got to acknowledge at least – you would have to at least acknowledge it intellectually,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.960]   whether you admit it emotionally or not.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   That's up to you.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.800]   But you got to at least acknowledge intellectually that it's possible to get in a position
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.400]   where you're still alive and you're still functional to some degree but you can't
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.400]   work.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   The second thing is usually men will make some motion that involves an imitation of
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.920]   a cocked gun pointed to their head and they'll say, "This is my solution."
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:32.440]   I never had any idea that so many people were suicidal until I started working at the disability
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.160]   insurance marketplace, which, man, is utterly absurd.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.920]   You're going to take the fact that you're disabled and just the fact that you're disabled
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.200]   means that you can't go on living and you somehow expect that you're disabled but
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.960]   your wife is going to leave a gun in the drawer next to you?
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.920]   She's smarter than that, buddy.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.480]   You're going to do that to your family?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   It's nonsense.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.640]   So those are just the two objections that always annoyed me that every single man would
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.080]   present to me and I – anyway, it just always annoyed me.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.000]   But that's the background on disability insurance.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.920]   That's my sales pitch to you.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.600]   So I urge you to consider it.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.680]   I urge you to consider the value of it.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.000]   I urge you to consider what you have, what you don't have.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.880]   We'll talk more about that in coming episodes.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   But I hope that it's somewhat compelling to you to at least look into it, to at least
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.400]   be open to it, and to at least think about it.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   What happens is disability insurance is not sold as aggressively as it should be.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.360]   That's why I don't get into a lot of the debates about – people want to get into
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.640]   debates about what insurance agents should do and what insurance agents shouldn't do.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.760]   One of the things that people who comment, the biggest debate is term life insurance
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.880]   versus whole life insurance.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.280]   Often, I want to pipe into that debate.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   It's like do you understand why life insurance agents sell whole life insurance?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.660]   Because people want to buy it.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.280]   When you talk about term life insurance and whole life insurance, people want to buy whole
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   life insurance because they get their money back.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.760]   Oftentimes, these very intelligent financial people who have run all the numbers and run
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.320]   all the math will go through and say, "Why do people – why are the majority of life
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.680]   insurance policies sold whole life insurance?"
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   Because people want to buy it.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.600]   They don't want to buy term life insurance with throwing their money away.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.480]   The sad thing is that – well, not a sad thing, but the reality is people buy what
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.040]   they want to buy.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:38.200]   Insurance agents find it easier to sell into a willing marketplace.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.880]   But here's what I would beg of you.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.480]   First, please consider buying disability insurance if you're a consumer.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:51.720]   If you're a life insurance agent, please work really hard to sell disability insurance.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.720]   One reason I never got that involved in the whole life insurance thing is usually if I
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.160]   work with a young family, the first sale I'm going to make is disability insurance.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.520]   I would frankly often keep from talking about life insurance because if I – until the
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:10.960]   disability insurance was either sold or rejected, until the prospective client had made a firm
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.760]   decision yes or no.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.360]   I knew that most people at this point are convinced that they're going to buy life
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.560]   insurance.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.040]   Most thinking parents, young parents, they know they need to get life insurance.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.080]   They'll go ahead and get some term life insurance.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.280]   But I always worked really, really hard to get disability insurance put in place first
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.600]   because it's more important.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.480]   Usually by the time you use up your budget, you look at the amount of dollars that are
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.960]   available and those dollars get sucked up by disability insurance and a term life insurance
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   policy.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.240]   You don't have any time or money to get on to anything different.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.760]   That's the reality.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.560]   So I urge you, please be open to it if an insurance agent talks to you about it.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.720]   Investigate it if you haven't.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.520]   You will find a difficult time finding insurance agents who are experts in this.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.720]   That's what set me on this last thing.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.520]   Many insurance agents have gotten beat in the face so many times by people saying, "I
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   don't want that.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.360]   I'll just grab the 45 in the drawer next to me and I'll take care of things," that they
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:12.320]   give up and they stop pushing through to find out what's right and to push through to what's
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   right.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.720]   I've met so many financial advisors who primarily specialize in investments.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.280]   I talk to them about disability insurance.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.480]   I can't do it.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   It's just too hard.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.360]   People don't want to buy it.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.040]   So you got to work hard as an insurance agent to do it, to sell disability insurance.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.280]   I encourage you, please do it.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:37.100]   If you are a listener who's skeptical about disability insurance, go and find an old seasoned
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:43.240]   life insurance agent, somebody who's been in the business for 30 or 40 years and ask
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:48.280]   them the number of their clients who have been disabled and who are out on claim or
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.600]   who've been out on claim for disability versus the number of clients that have died and they've
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.120]   paid a death claim.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.400]   I've done this.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:05.520]   What you find is that many old life insurance agents have a much higher number of their
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.960]   clients out on disability than death at a premature age.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.560]   Now, the numbers on this are hard to parse and I'm specifically avoiding saying them,
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.200]   but you have a higher probability of being disabled at an early age than you do of dying
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.760]   at an early age, a much higher probability.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.320]   So you've got to focus on that.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.520]   The reason the data is hard to parse is simply because everybody dies.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.660]   You're guaranteed to die.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.000]   You're not guaranteed to be disabled.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.420]   But if you look at even your own personal experience in your own circle of contact and
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.840]   ask yourself how many people have been disabled at an early age versus how many people have
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.040]   died at an early age, I think you'll find a similar fact pattern emerge.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.920]   That's my sales pitch for you on disability insurance.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.560]   We'll get into more details in future shows.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.840]   I hope this is useful to you.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.960]   I hope this is encouraging to you.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   If you agree with me or disagree with me, I'd be welcome to your comments.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:09.340]   I have had lots of people that disagree with me on which insurance I think is most important.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.240]   But I'm telling you, I'll take it every time.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.420]   I'll take disability insurance every time over any of the rest of them because the rest
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.360]   of the insurances protect somebody else.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.680]   Life insurance protects my family.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   I love them.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.080]   I want them to be protected.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.000]   Health insurance protects the hospital and the doctors and to some extent me.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.360]   Disability insurance is income and money in my pocket.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   That protects me.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.000]   Really feel strongly about it.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   That's it for my show today.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   Two quick things as we go.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.320]   I've had great success with many of you scheduling phone calls for personal consultations with
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   me.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.800]   I just announced that in the last couple of shows.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.600]   If you are interested in speaking to me or consulting with me on something specific,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.120]   please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/PhoneCall.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.800]   That service is now available to you.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.840]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/PhoneCall.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.680]   Things like this would be a great point of discussion.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.360]   I don't have an insurance license so I won't tell you buy this one or don't buy this one.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.640]   If you want to talk about whether you need it or not, I was on a consulting call on Friday
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.320]   and the listener said, "Do I need disability insurance?"
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   I said, "Yes.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.320]   Here's why."
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   Or excuse me, I said, "No."
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.400]   In that case, I said, "Yes, you need life insurance.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.240]   No, you don't need disability insurance because of some other extenuating circumstances."
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.160]   That's a great conversation if you want to get on the phone with me and talk about it.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.800]   If you want to get on the phone with me, you can put me on the phone with you and your
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.720]   insurance agent or somebody that you're working with.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.480]   If you just want a second opinion, an unbiased third party who's knowledgeable and experienced
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.600]   in your corner, we can do that.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.760]   If you want to have a consultation, I've done a lot of career counseling in the last few
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   days.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.640]   We've talked a lot about proper job selection, investment plans, how to invest for financial
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   independence, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/PhoneCall.
