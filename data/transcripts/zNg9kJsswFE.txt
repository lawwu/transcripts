[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   All right, final question here comes from Helen. Helen says,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.640]   Can you talk about the dangers of social media in two
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.280]   particular contexts, stalkers, and people who put their jobs
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.320]   at risk by silly things they post? Both of these are real
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.640]   issues. Helen, these are good. I'm glad you brought these up.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.800]   There's lots of issues that come with having a kind of constant
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.080]   interactive interaction with basically the entire world in a
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.880]   wide scale platform with a homogenized interface. So
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.560]   everyone just looks the same to everyone else. Yes, stalkers are
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   a big, big deal. You get weird. Sometimes it's just trolls. But
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520]   sometimes it can be more scary than that. Tim Ferriss have
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.920]   talked about this. Tim Ferriss has huge issues with this.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.040]   People find them, they look up his address and real estate
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240]   records, they crazy people get obsessed with them. So yeah,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.920]   there's a cost to putting yourself out there. Now Tim
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.360]   Ferriss is very famous. But why expose yourself to those costs?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.720]   You know, especially if you don't get the whatever the fame
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.000]   and fortune that comes with that fame. Social media just allows
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   you to expose yourself to this type of issues without the
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   reward. And then people who put their jobs at risk. Yes, it's a
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.520]   big source of stress. That's a big source of stress. You hear
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.720]   these stories because they get captured and amplified and
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.040]   spread of individuals that said the wrong thing. You know,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.400]   whatever, it was a joke that that landed flat or was taken
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.240]   out of context, or they weren't at their best, and then their
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200]   their job is gone. Yes, there's a fear of that happening to you.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.240]   But way more pervasive is the fear. I mean, that could
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.920]   actually happen. But the fear that that could happen is just
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.200]   going to pervade your life if you've decided that I'm going to
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.640]   just post a lot of things on social media. I do not
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.680]   understand. This cultural belief we had is something I've really
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800]   pushed back on a lot. Like everyone has to be on these
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.280]   platforms using them. They don't and most people shouldn't be
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   most people should not be on Facebook, or Twitter or
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   whatever, sharing their thoughts about everything. I mean, I know
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.880]   it presses some buttons, but people don't care. They're not
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   following you. They don't really care. But you're giving
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.920]   yourself all these stresses by being out there in the public
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.560]   eye. I mean, I'm barely in the public eye. And there's like 80%
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.280]   of it I hate. Why would you want to do this voluntarily? I mean,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.120]   this video camera makes me a little bit uncomfortable. I'm
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.760]   like somewhat uncomfortable with people knowing what I look like
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.440]   I'm an academic writer, I like you know, books to come out. Now
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.160]   I thought this was important, because this information is
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   important and has to be broken up into whatever. And we've
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080]   talked about this whole thing. But why bring this upon yourself
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.920]   the stress of weirdos that can now follow me the stress of what
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.880]   if I say something wrong, and I get fired. And again, whether or
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.920]   not that's actually going to happen doesn't matter. The fear
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400]   is causing issues in your life. And there's other things Helen
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.040]   that you know, you're not missing here that can be just as
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.880]   bad. The stress of seeing someone say something negative
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.680]   about you or what you said. We're not wired to handle that
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   we're wired to take that very seriously. Because historically,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   when someone is saying, you know, you're terrible, it was
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   someone in our tribe, and it meant that we were probably
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.720]   doing something terrible. Now it's just sport on Twitter, but
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.440]   why expose yourself to that? This cultural idea that if you
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.640]   have to be on social media, it's weird, if you're not, I think
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.680]   it's just crazy. I think social media should be a thing that
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.960]   like for some people, like has a very clear use. But it's not a
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.840]   universal. It's not like if you're not on Twitter, it's
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   deciding to ride a horse instead of driving a car. Or you know,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.920]   you don't own a television, I think it should be way more
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.440]   narrow than that most people don't need to be on there. Most
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.320]   people, at least posting on there, most people's life would
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.880]   be significantly less stressful if they weren't for all these
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.920]   type of reasons. There's a lot of negative externalities to
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.080]   interactive social media use. And Helen, you were right to
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.680]   bring this up. Because it's yet another reason why we should be
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.640]   way more careful about these technologies, and be way more
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.240]   suspicious about the current cultural climate that at least
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   until a minute ago, basically made it seem like if you were
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   not on all these platforms, sharing your thoughts with the
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.440]   world that somehow there was something wrong about you. Being
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   in the public eye is a weird place to be. It's a fraught
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.680]   place to be. Don't throw yourself into that for no other
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.800]   reason than just people thought it would be cool to have that
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.080]   app.
