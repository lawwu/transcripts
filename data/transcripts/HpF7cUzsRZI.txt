[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.800]   in that chapter, a portion of which we read at the beginning, namely the epistle of Paul
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:21.200]   to the Romans in the eighth chapter, looking at verses three and four.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   In the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, "For what the law could not do,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.080]   in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:49.440]   flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.760]   fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit."
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.440]   I want more particularly to direct attention to the third verse.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:10.800]   "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:21.760]   own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.560]   Now I call your attention to this verse in order that through it and by means of it we
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.960]   may consider together what the Christian message really is.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   Or if you prefer it, I am calling your attention to this verse during this season of Advent
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.160]   in order that we may remind ourselves once more as to the real message of Advent, the
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   message, if you like, of Christmas.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   For as I want to try to show you, in this verse we are told in a very direct and plain
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.880]   manner what this message really is.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.640]   Now I wonder whether there is anybody listening to me at this moment who feels that this is
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.360]   rather an odd and a strange and an unusual verse or text to take on such an occasion
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.000]   and in order to deal with the message of Christmas and of Advent.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.040]   Do you have the feeling that this is not exactly what you would expect?
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.760]   I ask my Christian for this good reason, that I am familiar, of course, with the kind of
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   way in which so many people think of Christmas and of Christianity and the whole message
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.440]   of this Christian faith to the world in its present misery and wretchedness and unhappiness.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.000]   There are those who think of it simply as some very beautiful story, something which
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.800]   when you read it or when you listen to it gives you a nice and a happy and a comfortable
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:22.680]   feeling, not doctrine like this, none of this argumentation, but just some beautiful picture.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560]   The world likes to think of it like that.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.240]   People who never go to a place of worship like singing carols.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.920]   They say they're very beautiful and they say we are very glad that there is something
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.320]   beautiful like that in the world which is so dark and so full of problem and of misery.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.200]   And that's their way of thinking of the Christian message, a babe, innocence, beauty,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.560]   simplicity, and they like to look at that and to think about that and they feel better
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.040]   for a while.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.640]   And that is to them the whole message of Christmas.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   Then there are others, as you know, who think of the Christian message as if it were some
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.320]   form or type of philosophy, some kind of teaching.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.680]   They say we are in a world that is torn by wars and antagonisms and hatreds and there's
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.000]   a great deal of unhappiness and there's a great deal of suffering.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.440]   What can be done about this?
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.320]   Well they say the politicians don't seem to be very successful, the statesmen are not
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   doing very well.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.280]   Ah, but they say that's quite inevitable.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.760]   There's only one thing that's needed and that is people must have the right philosophy.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.680]   And you ask them, well what is that?
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.560]   Well they say the right philosophy is this, you must teach people to think beautiful thoughts.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.800]   That's the essence of Christianity.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   They must stop thinking negatively, they must think positively.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.680]   They must begin to think in terms of loving one another and if they all only did that
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.180]   you'd never have another war, you'd banish all troubles.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.560]   So all we need to do is to tell people that we love them.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.080]   And we must encourage others to do the same thing.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.040]   And they say that that is the Christian message, that's the message of Christianity.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.960]   That it's just a philosophy of teaching which would have people think like this in
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   loving terms and try to apply this love to one another.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.960]   And there are various other forms which this way of looking at the Christmas message and
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   the Christian message tends to take.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.000]   But they can all be reduced to some kind of common denominator like that.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.840]   Christianity is thought of as a way of thinking primarily, as a teaching, an outlook.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   And that therefore its message is to call upon us to think in that way and to put that
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.720]   thinking into practice.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.920]   It's something primarily that you and I have got to do.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.240]   A philosophy which you and I adopt and put into practice.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.000]   Well now then, it is because I want to try to show that that is a complete travesty of
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.840]   the Christian faith, the Christian message, that I'm calling your attention to this
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.080]   verse this evening.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:35.160]   Here you see at once we are reminded of something that is pivotal and vital.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.520]   And that is that first and foremost the Christian message is a matter of history.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.000]   It is a record of certain facts.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.760]   Why do you talk about Christmas Day?
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.600]   It's an anniversary of something.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.000]   What's it an anniversary of?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.680]   It's the anniversary of the birth of that babe in Bethlehem.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.840]   A fact.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.480]   A fact of history.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.880]   Why do we call this 1956?
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   Same reason.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.440]   It was all started when he came.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.120]   It's 1956 years since these events happened.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.280]   History.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.000]   So that you see the Christian message is primarily not a philosophy.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.320]   It is a recital of facts.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   It is an announcement and a proclamation of certain things that have happened and have
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   taken place.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.480]   Ah yes, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.880]   Because you see if it had stopped at that, well then we would have nothing to do tonight
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:47.560]   but to change this type of service altogether and have a crib here in the pulpit and have
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   someone representing the babe and have the appropriate lights and the star and we'd
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.120]   just sing carols together and we'd say we were reminding one another of the facts.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.600]   But you notice that that isn't the way that the Apostle Paul does it.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.560]   His way of giving us this message is one that seems to be full of argument.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.880]   He starts with a word like the word "for."
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   This is logic.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   For.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.080]   It's full of a kind of theology as I'm going to show you.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.920]   But ah, says someone, surely that's not the Christmas message.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.200]   I thought the Christmas message was delightfully simple and beautiful.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   Something that belongs rather to the realm of the fancy and of fantasy, almost belonging
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.120]   to the realm of the fairy tale.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.480]   You surely are not going to argue with us.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.520]   You're surely not going to preach theology and doctrine to us at Christmas time.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.400]   Of all times.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.440]   We rather want to sing and to just look at all the beauty of it all and the wonder and
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.640]   to feel happy.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.160]   But we can't do that, the Apostle puts it like this, for what the law could not do,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.480]   in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.240]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.280]   the flesh.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.480]   So that my second principle you see is this.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.240]   The first thing we have to remember is that the Christian message is a recital of facts,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.600]   historical facts.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   But secondly, it gives us an explanation of the meaning of the facts.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.720]   Now that's a very important principle.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:46.680]   The true understanding of history is not simply to be able to recite dates like a parrot or
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   to recite the things that have happened.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.000]   No, no, that's not true history.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.560]   True history consists of facts plus the explanation of the facts.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.640]   The meaning of the facts, that's the true understanding.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.840]   Once a well-known historian put this, I think, rather well.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:15.720]   He put it in terms of the discovery of America by Columbus and he put it in this form.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:23.020]   Now he said, "The important thing is not to know when Columbus discovered America,
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.880]   the important thing is to know why he discovered it."
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   That's history.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.120]   There you're coming to the realm of meaning.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:37.800]   Now then, the Bible, the New Testament, is always concerned about the meaning.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.600]   That is why you see we haven't got a mere bare recital of the facts in connection with
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.800]   the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.480]   We've got explanations.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.440]   He gave explanations himself.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.920]   And the apostles in these epistles, they're full of explanations.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.880]   And here in this one verse tonight, we have one of these profound and at the same time
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:07.800]   succinct explanations of what it is exactly that happened on that first Christmas day.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.160]   What exactly is the message of Christmas?
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.200]   What is the whole message of the Christian faith?
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.240]   Now then, let me put it like this here.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.820]   We all, do we not, refer to this New Testament as the gospel?
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.360]   We talk about the four gospels.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.960]   Why do you call it gospel?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.120]   Well you all know the answer.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.560]   The word gospel means good news.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   It's an old word which stands for good news.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.320]   Very well, the whole message about the Lord Jesus Christ, the message of Christmas, is
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.080]   a message of good news.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.600]   You read those early chapters of Matthew and Mark and Luke, and you find them full of this
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.920]   praise and of thanksgiving, the heavenly choir sang, "Everybody begins to sing."
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   Why?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Good news.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:10.200]   So that a very good way for us to test ourselves and our whole attitude towards Christmas and
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.400]   Christianity is this.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.480]   Is our conception of the Christian message, the Christmas message one, that rarely can
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   be described as good news?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.920]   Is Christianity to me tonight the best news I know of?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.680]   Is this the most exciting, the most thrilling, the most marvelous thing I've ever heard?
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   Good news.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:45.520]   Now, it's called gospel so that you see we can very easily test whether our view of Christianity
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.120]   is right or not.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   If my view of it doesn't conform to this description of good news, well, then it is
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.560]   absolutely certain that I've got a wrong view of it.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.480]   But the gospel is good news.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.000]   Why is it good news?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   Now then, let me show you how this apostle answers that question.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.760]   Why is this good news, I ask?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.400]   Ah, his first reply is this, "It's good news because of the state and the condition
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.600]   of mankind apart from it and without it."
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.620]   It is good news come into the world, into a world that was very much in need of good
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.620]   news.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.640]   "Where do you find that, sir?"
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.120]   Someone will let me answer.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:41.040]   "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   That's it.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   That's the condition of mankind, weak through the flesh.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.880]   Did you notice how the apostle kept on saying that?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.040]   Now, let's look at it like this.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:02.560]   Before anything is good news to you, you obviously must be in a condition in which you need good
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.600]   news.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.040]   If you've got everything that the heart can desire, well, in a sense, you'll never
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   hear any good news.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.040]   You've already got everything.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.120]   Good news is that which comes to people who are in trouble and in need.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.680]   And certainly as you and I are in this building at this moment, if we've never realized our
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.920]   need, well, then it is absolutely certain that the gospel has never been good news to
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   us.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.720]   It comes around once a year and we say, "Ah, Christmas has come again."
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.640]   Perhaps we've gone beyond the stage of the vast majority of people to which it's merely
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.080]   an occasion for the flesh and for jollification and things like that.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   "Oh, no," we say, "there's more than that in it.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   After all, it's very beautiful.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.600]   There's a sort of idealism about it."
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.480]   But it's not thrilling good news to us.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.840]   We try frantically to apply it for a week or so, and we couple it with our New Year's
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   resolutions, but we've very soon forgotten all about it.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.920]   And it's not good news to us.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   Why?
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.260]   Well, I say, because we've never realized our need.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.660]   We have never realized the truth about ourselves.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.980]   We have never realized our estate and condition.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   What is that?
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.620]   Well, listen to his exposition of it.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.460]   Did you notice that first verse?
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:28.620]   He says, "There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.900]   You see, the implication of that is this, that there is condemnation to those who are
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.140]   not in Christ Jesus.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:43.260]   Now there is the first thing that the Bible always tells us about our estate and condition.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:50.220]   This Christian message is good news to people who are under condemnation.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:57.180]   Or listen to the second verse, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.540]   made me free from the law of sin and death."
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:08.180]   Well, very well, before I heard this message, I was under the bondage and the serfdom of
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.260]   the law of sin and death.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260]   I was held captive, and I couldn't get free.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.540]   But this has come, and I'm set at liberty.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.940]   Good news.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.940]   You notice how every time it's the same thing.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:28.180]   It is good news because of the condition, the state in which we were.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.900]   Now then, let us work out this a little.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:42.060]   Had you realized your estate by nature as you come into this world?
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.260]   Do you know the meaning of this term "condemnation"?
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.460]   What's this man talking about?
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.180]   Well, this is the message you know of the whole Bible.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:17:00.660]   It is, to summarize it, something that can be put like this.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:08.460]   God made the world, and he made men for himself and in his own image.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:16.900]   He meant men to live a life of communion with him, a life of glory, a life of purity.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.580]   It was meant to be a life of joy and unmixed happiness.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:33.980]   But alas, man lifted up himself and rebelled against God, asserted his own will, defied
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.420]   God.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:41.380]   And thereby he fell away from God.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.860]   And God punishes men for doing this.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.540]   He had told men that he would.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.020]   In the day that thou eatest thereof, he had said about that prohibited fruit, thou shalt
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.780]   die.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.580]   And he told them that certain other consequences would come as well.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.840]   But the most terrible consequence of all is this, that man has thus broken the relationship
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:12.340]   with God and is now destined to spend his eternity as he is, apart from the life of
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.700]   God.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:20.460]   Not only that, God made it very plain and clear in many subsequent generations that
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:28.780]   because he is a holy and a righteous and a just God, that he must and he will punish
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.420]   the sin of men.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.660]   That's the meaning of the word condemnation.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.580]   You get it in the Ten Commandments, you get it in the moral law given through Moses, you
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.580]   get it everywhere.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:50.860]   Man in sin is under the wrath and the condemnation of God.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.820]   Now that's something that you'll find in the Bible from the beginning to the end.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.100]   The Lord Jesus Christ taught it, these apostles taught it, the Christian church has always
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.100]   taught it.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.460]   There is no Christian message apart from it.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.660]   And you see there's no good news apart from it.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.360]   This is where the good news comes in.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.620]   Man is under condemnation.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:21.100]   And the very state of the world tonight is a part of that condemnation.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:28.540]   A part of God's way of punishing men in sin is just to leave men to himself and to his
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.740]   own devices and to his own world and what he's made of it.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.180]   And the result is what you've got in the world tonight, with all its wretchedness and misery
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.500]   and unhappiness.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.220]   That's a part of the wrath of God.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.220]   Now if you want to see a wonderful exposition of that, read this selfsame epistle to the
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.680]   Romans in the first chapter.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.300]   Begin at verse 18 and read to the end of the chapter and there you'll get it.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:00.260]   "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.260]   of men."
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.660]   There it is.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.700]   But you know it doesn't stop at that.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:20.020]   The message goes on to say that anyone who dies in that condition will go on to spend
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:26.740]   an eternity in that condition.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.940]   This message tells us that death is not the end.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.740]   "Ah, but sir, someone, can you prove that a man lives after death?"
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.980]   My dear friend, let me ask you a question.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.740]   Can you prove that he doesn't?
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.100]   The Bible tells us that he does, that he goes on.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.300]   I could deduce many philosophical arguments to prove and demonstrate the same thing to
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   you.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.740]   There are other arguments, even if you like spiritism, that seems to me to prove it.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.220]   But I'm not concerned about that.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.700]   I say this is the message of God's word, that when a man dies, it's not the end.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.860]   He goes on to face God in the judgment.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:12.340]   If he dies in sin, if he dies as he is alienated from God, well, he's going to spend eternity
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.060]   in that condition.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.260]   That's condemnation.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:29.740]   And according to this man's teaching, everybody in this world by nature is in that condition.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.460]   "There is none righteous," he says, "no, not one.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.820]   Every mouth has been stopped.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.220]   The whole world lieth guilty before God."
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.800]   And we know it's true of every one of us.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.940]   We haven't even believed in God many a time.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.660]   We've argued against God.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.180]   We've criticized God.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.660]   We've said if God is this and that, he oughtn't to be and so on.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.900]   That's sin in a most terrible form against God.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.580]   We've gone our own way.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.660]   We've spurned the voice divine.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.260]   We've rejected God's offer of forgiveness.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.380]   That's sin.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   We are all sinners.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:14.940]   And we're all under condemnation, therefore, and all under the wrath of God.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:22.620]   And in that condition, we are told that we are absolutely helpless to redeem or to rescue
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   ourselves.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:33.220]   Here it is, you see, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.220]   What's this mean?
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:41.420]   Well, that is a reference to the law that God gave the children of Israel through Moses.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   That's the Ten Commandments again and the moral law.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.540]   And when God gave that law to the children of Israel through Moses, he said this.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.500]   He said if you can keep that law, it'll save you.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.040]   If you can keep it, it will save you.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.020]   And what the apostle is saying here is that no one could keep it.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.580]   What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.100]   There was nothing wrong with the law.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.020]   The law of God is absolutely perfect.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   It's a holy law.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.460]   It's a righteous law.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.900]   And you know, my friends, if only everybody in the world kept the Ten Commandments tonight,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.660]   the world would be a very different place, wouldn't it?
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.140]   If everybody just kept this and put God first and honored him and lived for him, if no one
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:36.300]   worshipped any sort of idol, if everybody kept the Lord's day, if everybody said, "Yes,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.540]   these laws are right.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.540]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.540]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.540]   Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.580]   And all the rest of it, "Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.860]   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife or his servant or his ass or his ox."
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.620]   If only the whole world believed that, we wouldn't be in this terrible position we are
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.700]   in this evening, would we?
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.020]   You'd have no need of the United Nations organization.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.340]   You'd have no need of all these conferences.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.060]   You know, you wouldn't even have need of the laws of Great Britain.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:14.220]   If only everybody kept the Ten Commandments, they've been facing mankind for all these
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:20.660]   long centuries, but man can't keep them.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.900]   What's the use, therefore, of saying that the message of Christmas is just a call to
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.820]   us to apply a philosophy or to apply a teaching?
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.980]   What's the use of saying the message the world needs is this, that we must all stop hating
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.420]   one another and begin to love one another?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.860]   The question is, how can you do it?
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:44.820]   Here God gave a law, the Ten Commandments and the moral law, and he said, "Keep that,"
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:50.460]   and they couldn't keep it for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.380]   flesh.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.820]   The trouble isn't in us, it's in the law.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.500]   The trouble is not in the law, it's in us, in our flesh.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.380]   I think I once mentioned to you before an illustration I once heard a very old preacher
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.460]   give which put this, I think, absolutely perfectly.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.220]   He said it was like this.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.220]   Think of a spade.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:22.820]   There's your spade made of iron, and then there's this wooden handle, and you've got
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.020]   to dig a very hard bit of ground, and you keep on trying.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.580]   Well, the spade's all right, but unfortunately, because of the hardness of the ground, as
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.260]   you put it in and try to lift up the handle, it keeps on breaking.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:41.420]   Nothing wrong with the spade as such, but the handle was too weak.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.660]   And the law of God, you see, couldn't save anybody.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:50.900]   It wasn't meant to save anybody because of the weakness of man, this weakness in the
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.900]   flesh.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:59.180]   Now, again, here's a marvelous exposition of this in the previous chapter, chapter 7,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:06.500]   where the great apostle puts it all in terms of himself, as it were, in this way.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.580]   He says, "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.780]   For that which I do, I allow not.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.020]   For what I would, that do I not.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.540]   But what I hate, that I do."
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   Isn't this true of you?
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   It's true of me.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.500]   It's true of all of us.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.060]   There is this contradiction in the flesh.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.940]   "For what I would, that I do not.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.060]   But what I hate, that I do.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.100]   If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.940]   Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.620]   For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:57.900]   For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not."
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.180]   How true this is.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.020]   "For the good that I would, I do not.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.260]   But the evil that I would not, that I do.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.540]   Now then, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   in me.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.620]   I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.980]   For I delight in the law of God after the inward men.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:28.540]   Yet I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:33.180]   into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:40.220]   O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?"
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.860]   That's the position.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.780]   And that is still the position with every human being.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:55.220]   "What fools we are to talk about suddenly stopping, hating one another, and beginning
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   to love.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.340]   Man has always known he should do that.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   He's done the opposite.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.340]   The trouble is in our wills.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.340]   It's in our flesh.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.380]   I want to do that, but I do this.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.820]   I don't do what I want to do.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.460]   I do what I don't want to do.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.300]   And I'm constantly kicking and cursing myself.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.820]   I know I shouldn't do a thing, and I go and do it.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.180]   And I wake up the next morning and say, 'What made me do it?
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.180]   I'll never do it again.'
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.180]   And I do it again.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.860]   And you've all done the same.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.860]   That's the trouble.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.420]   What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:33.980]   Thank God the message of Christmas and of Christianity is not a philosophy, a teaching,
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.900]   which I've got to believe and apply.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.220]   I can't do it.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.260]   I can't keep my own resolutions.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.060]   I can't rise to my own moral concepts.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.140]   How still less can I love people and stop to hate them?
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   I wish I could.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.140]   I cannot.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.580]   I am in bondage to the law of sin that is in my members, in my flesh.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:29:06.540]   There is the condition of mankind under the condemnation of God's law, under
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:18.380]   the wrath of God, full of sin and of evil, unable to deliver ourselves, unable to get
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.460]   out of the fetters and the chains, unable to find this liberty which we seem to long
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.460]   for.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:31.220]   Now, then, I say it's only people who realize that that's the truth about themselves who
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.660]   will ever realize that the gospel is good news.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.620]   If you think that you're living a very good life by yourself, well, you don't need Jesus
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.820]   Christ, and I'm not a bit surprised that Christmas means nothing to you.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.340]   If you think that it's a philosophy that you can apply, well, very well.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.380]   He's not necessary in a sense, and you don't need much help because you are able to do
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.740]   it.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.300]   But if you see that this diagnosis that I've just been giving you from these chapters of
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:08.340]   this epistle to the Romans is nothing but the simple and stark and terrifying truth
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:17.380]   about you, if you realize you're lost and you're helpless, if you realize that the forces
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.980]   that are in you are stronger than your will and your mind and your understanding, if I
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:29.100]   say you realize you're all together without hope, then you'll begin to cry out for help.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.180]   You'll look for something that can come and offer you deliverance, and thank God that
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.820]   is the message of the gospel.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:44.940]   It was the people that sat in darkness that saw the great light.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.740]   It's men who are in prison who thank God when they hear somebody coming and the jingling
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.700]   of a chain with a key to open the door.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:59.060]   The people who don't realize their captivity obviously have no need of deliverance.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:06.540]   And so the Lord Jesus Christ himself said, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.940]   to repentance.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:14.740]   They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.740]   That's what he said.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.620]   Very well, let me now show you how that being our condition, how the good news comes in.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.620]   What is it?
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.620]   Here it is.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:36.380]   It is that in the midst of our failure and shame and helplessness, God announces that
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.140]   he's going to do something and then he does it.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:46.940]   "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   God!
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.260]   Oh, thank God for that.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.500]   Men can do nothing, weak through the flesh.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.660]   And he's tried and he's failed, but there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.180]   The whole world lieth guilty before him.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.820]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.820]   Men have failed.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.820]   The best men have failed.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   The patriots, the saints, the prophets, they've all failed.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   Men have failed.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:21.940]   "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.020]   God!
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.340]   He is going to do something.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:36.020]   And my dear friend, that's always the first thing to grasp about this Christian message.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:43.860]   The Christian message is not primarily a call to you or to me to do anything.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:51.100]   It is primarily a proclamation of what God in his infinite love and mercy and compassion
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.980]   has done for us.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.980]   What is it?
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   Well, listen to the way he puts it.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:09.620]   "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.620]   in the flesh."
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.260]   What is it?
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.900]   Oh, let me tell it to you again.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.580]   And may the Holy Spirit of God so illuminate to you and so illumine your mind and heart
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.220]   and understanding that you may see it as you've never seen it before.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   This is the message.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:44.020]   "In that state of the world and of men, God sent out of heaven into it his own Son."
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.020]   What does that mean?
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:54.420]   It means this, his unique Son, his only begotten Son.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.620]   That's what it means.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.740]   That's why he uses the term deliberately.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.580]   Christ is God's own Son.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.460]   Now we are told in the Scriptures that Adam was the Son of God, and Adam was the Son of
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.460]   God.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.260]   We are told that the angels are sons of God, and they are sons of God.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:20.900]   Yes, but neither Adam was God's own son, never was an angel God's own son.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.140]   Adam was a created being.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.460]   The angels are created beings.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.380]   Here is one who is not created.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:41.580]   He is God's own Son, the only begotten Son of the Father.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.460]   He has been generated by God.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.940]   Now it's a great mystery, and your mind and mine can never aspire into this, but this
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.940]   is the gospel.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:56.420]   This is the good news, that in that Godhead there are three persons, Father, Son, Holy
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   Spirit.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.300]   And what God has done is this.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:11.100]   He has sent out his own Son, "who had dwelt in his bosom from all eternity, who was coequal
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.900]   with him and coeternal."
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.300]   God sent his own Son.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.620]   Here is the message of good news.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:26.060]   We live in a world in which men are born of women, the result of wedlock, and generation
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.980]   comes and goes, and they have all tried and have all failed.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:35.540]   Here we are on this level, man and his endeavor, and nothing but failure and darkness.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.260]   Suddenly something unique happens.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   What's this?
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.100]   God, the Son, comes down, the Father has sent him.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   That's good news.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.940]   Here is something men have never heard of before.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.380]   Here is something that can never happen again in that sense.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:56.060]   God sent forth his own Son into this world.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.220]   But wait a minute.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.740]   How did he come?
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:09.500]   Well you notice the answer, he came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.180]   What does this mean?
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:19.500]   Well you notice that he doesn't say that he came in sinful flesh.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:27.100]   He says that he came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:35.940]   And he said that very deliberately in order to remind us of this, that there was no sin
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:42.740]   in him, even his flesh was not sinful.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:48.220]   You and I are all born in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:54.580]   Our parents are sinful, and their flesh is sinful, and we are born in sinful flesh, and
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.060]   we start with a bias to evil and to wrong.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.980]   Here is one who was not born in sinful flesh, but in its likeness.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:09.100]   The Holy Ghost came upon Mary and cleansed that orphan that was impregnated by him, so
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.920]   that his flesh should be free from sin.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.860]   He was holy, he was perfect.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.560]   He was like God still, he is still God.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.100]   He took unto him human nature.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.540]   He is still the sinless Son of God.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:33.940]   Yes, but it is equally important that we should remember that he did come in the likeness
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:47.300]   of sinful flesh, which means this, that he did come in a flesh in which he experienced
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.660]   all the infirmities that result from sin.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.900]   He was truly man, the word was made flesh.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.820]   He did not have a phantom body.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.460]   No, no, it was truly human nature, but it was cleansed from sin.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.940]   There was no evil in it, yet the infirmities were there.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.820]   It was in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:16.020]   This is tremendously important.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:25.620]   You know, the artists and the poets have often twisted and perverted this gospel message.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:32.620]   You look at their portrayals of the manger or of the stable, and you will see the babe
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:38.700]   with a halo around his head or a brightness shining from his face.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.060]   It is all imagination.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   He never had a halo.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.540]   If he had a halo, he would not have been in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:54.300]   No, no, he just looked a babe like every other babe, and people could not recognize him.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.980]   They said, "He is just a carpenter.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   Who is this fellow?"
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.700]   No, no, there was not a halo around his head.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.560]   He was in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.660]   You know, the scriptures make this very plain and clear.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.580]   Listen to Isaiah prophesying what he would be like.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:17.580]   This is how he puts it, "As many as were astonished at thee, his visage was so marred
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:24.000]   more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.380]   He hath no form or comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.900]   should desire him.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.300]   He is despised and rejected of men.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.620]   If he had got a halo, men would have run after him and would have worshipped him.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.100]   There was not a halo.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:47.780]   That is the false imagination of a human philosophy insinuating itself into this glorious gospel.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.900]   No, no, the gospel is realistic.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:00.540]   He came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:06.780]   He knew what it was to be weary and to be tired.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.300]   He knew what it was to be disappointed in his friends and in his followers.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:20.580]   He knew pain and suffering and hunger and thirst.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:31.340]   He had all the infirmities of the flesh, but none of the sin.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:43.660]   And he lived his life in this world as a man and was tempted in all points like as we are,
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.300]   yet without sin.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.620]   Oh, my dear friends, if I could but make you see this.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.620]   This is message.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.020]   This is the Christmas message.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:41:01.220]   God, the eternal Son, his own Son, came all the way from heaven to that.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:07.980]   In the likeness of sinful flesh, he lived in this world that you and I know so well.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.900]   Can you imagine what it was like?
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:16.300]   Coming from the heaven and its glory and all its bliss and perfection into this infernal
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:24.060]   world, into all its shame and anger and bitterness and all its mockery and sham and all its lust
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:30.300]   and passion and vice and evil, but he came.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.980]   In the likeness of sinful flesh, but you know, it doesn't stop even there.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.100]   It goes on.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.140]   And for sin, what does this mean?
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.780]   Well, it means that he came specially in order to deal with this problem of sin.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.340]   It means that he came in connection with sin.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:42:00.780]   It means this, that he came to do that about your sin and mine which the law could not
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.300]   do.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:10.180]   For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:16.740]   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin did it.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.860]   The law could not deliver us out of that condemnation.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.020]   He has sent his Son for sin and he's done it.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.020]   How has he done it?
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.540]   Here is the answer.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:35.020]   Condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.620]   Let me expound this to you.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:49.340]   This is the heart of the gospel, the most amazing thing that has ever happened.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:57.780]   God has made his own Son to be a sacrifice for sin.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.460]   He sent him into the world to do that.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:09.460]   Not that you and I might send Christmas cards to one another and sentimentalize, "Oh,
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:15.020]   my dear friend, the problem of men is too profound for that sort of thing."
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.340]   Not merely that we might have a general message about goodwill and love, "The problem of
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.460]   men and his weakness in the flesh is much too deep for that."
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   No, no.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:35.660]   Somehow or another this problem of sin and of condemnation has got to be dealt with.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:43.460]   And God sent his Son into the world in order that he might deal with it, and he did it.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:50.460]   He sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin that he might condemn sin in the
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.060]   flesh, in his flesh.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.620]   Men had sinned in the flesh.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.060]   The sin was in the flesh.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:03.500]   Very well, here is one who takes that flesh and then he took the sin upon himself.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.740]   He gave his soul an offering for sin.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.940]   That's what he's saying.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:20.500]   Or if you like it in other language, "God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:27.820]   God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.460]   of God in him.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.220]   God in him has condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:38.300]   That is what happened on the cross on Calvary's hill, you see.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:49.900]   There Christ made himself our substitute and God put our sins upon him.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.020]   And he condemned them and he punished them.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.140]   And the punishment meant the death of Christ.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.600]   But by dying he bore the punishment.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:09.400]   But because he was God, he rose again and God's law is fully satisfied.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.440]   That's the Christmas message.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:22.040]   The first thing that we all need is to be delivered from condemnation.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   We have all sinned against God and his holy law and the record is there.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.800]   And God, because he is holy and pure and just and righteous, he can't just say, "All
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.280]   right, I'll pretend I haven't seen it or I'll forget all about it and I'll love
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.280]   you and forgive you."
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.560]   Do you know, my friend, if God could do that, Christ need never have come into this world.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.040]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.640]   If God can forgive sin simply by his love and by saying, "All right, we'll forgive
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.440]   it all," and you needn't think any more about it.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.760]   Why did Christ come into the world?
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:04.800]   If it's just a question of God's love, I ask you again, why Christmas?
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.440]   Why was there ever a babe born in Bethlehem and put in a manger?
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.600]   Why did he ever go to the cross?
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.720]   Why did he tell his followers to drink wine and to eat bread and to break it?
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   What's the meaning of this communion?
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.440]   Why all this history?
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.840]   Why talk about a babe and so on?
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.440]   If God can do it in his love, why the incarnation?
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:32.160]   Why the life, the miracles, the atoning death, the burial, the resurrection, and all the
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.640]   work of the Holy Spirit?
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:39.880]   It would all be unnecessary.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:47.040]   But you see, it is all absolutely essential.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.200]   Man has got to be delivered from condemnation.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   He can't deliver himself.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.800]   The law can't enable him to.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   Nothing can.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.440]   He's completely helpless.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.880]   He's down on the ground.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880]   How can he be delivered?
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.880]   Here's the good news.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:13.320]   The Son of God came into this world to bear our sins and our guilt and our shame.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:22.240]   He has taken the responsibility all upon himself, and God has condemned your sins and mine.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.760]   He's judged them.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:30.320]   He's punished them in the flesh of his own Son.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:36.920]   There on Calvary's hill.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:49.720]   And because of that, if I believe in him, I know my sins are forgiven.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.520]   There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   Why?
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.000]   Well, because he's born it.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.080]   They're under condemnation in and of themselves, but the moment they're in him, the moment
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:09.280]   they believe this message, the moment they see their own darkness, and then the wonderful
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   good news about what God has done in his Son, and say, "I believe it.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.240]   I'll risk my all on it.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.920]   I'll surrender to it."
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.320]   There is no more condemnation.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.240]   Their sins are forgiven.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.800]   They're blotted out.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:33.480]   Not only that, you notice that he goes on to say that we are made children of God.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.760]   And heirs of God.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.840]   And joint heirs with Christ.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.560]   We are given a new life.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.880]   We no longer, he says, live in the flesh, but in the Spirit.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   We've got a new strength and a new power.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.320]   We've got a new understanding of everything.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:04.560]   And we have a faith that can see through the present to the future, can even see through
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:11.000]   death and to the glory that lies beyond it.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:21.280]   And so, even as we look at our torn, distracted, unhappy world this evening, we can say, "For
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:33.000]   we know that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   glory which shall be revealed in us."
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.680]   This Christ of God who has delivered us from condemnation and the wrath of God and the
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:50.480]   law, and who has made us children of God and joint heirs with himself, is going to lead
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.160]   us on and sustain us and strengthen us and enable us to follow him.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.000]   And he'll take us through death and he'll present us faultless to God.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.520]   And when he comes back to reign, he'll bring us with him.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:16.240]   And we'll reign with him on earth and spend our eternity in his glorious presence.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.320]   That's the message of Christmas.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.640]   Is it that to you?
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.280]   Had you realized the truth of all I've been saying?
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.000]   It's quite simple, this question, isn't it?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.440]   Is this story about Jesus Christ to you at this moment the most wonderful thing you've
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.240]   ever heard, the most marvelous thing in the world?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:55.800]   If it isn't, well then I say you are still under condemnation and you don't know it.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:03.080]   You're like a man who's got a terrible cancer and he believes he's perfectly well.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.200]   You don't know you're in prison.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.840]   You don't know what awaits you when you die.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:14.120]   For the fact is you are under condemnation and your flesh is weak as I've tried to show
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.480]   you.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:25.920]   But if you realize that, and if you realize your failure and your wretchedness and the
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:35.880]   awful future that awaits you, then I plead with you, listen to this message.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:48.680]   God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin and condemned your sin in
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:56.440]   his flesh and is ready to receive you in Christ now.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:04.200]   So go to him, acknowledge and confess the justice of his condemnation.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.720]   Admit and acknowledge and confess your utter weakness and tell him that you believe the
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:17.800]   good news and trust yourself to it and ask him by his Holy Spirit to make it plain and
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:26.480]   clear to you that you may live the rest of your life in this world rejoicing in it and
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.600]   telling others of it.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.160]   That is what God did on the first Christmas day.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:45.840]   He sent his own Son into the world to die for you and for your sins.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   Amen.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
