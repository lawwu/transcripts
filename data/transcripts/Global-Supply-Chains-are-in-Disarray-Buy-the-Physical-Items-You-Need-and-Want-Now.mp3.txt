[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.260]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.140]   Today, I want to talk with you about security.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.780]   I want to give you a warning
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680]   and hope to do this in the appropriate way.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.540]   Right now, global supply chains are in massive disarray.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.260]   They are experiencing massive stress.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.020]   Perhaps you have noticed that many things
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.860]   that you would like to go and get right now
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960]   are limited in quantity or unavailable.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.000]   This is not universally true for any one market
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.280]   or in any one country.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.880]   Rather, what you're seeing are shortages in pockets.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.620]   And for that reason, I think there's some chance
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.720]   that perhaps you're not noticing this.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.780]   And so thus, I want to warn you.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.720]   But if you go looking for it,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.060]   the warnings of the shortages
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.420]   that people are experiencing right now are abundant.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.860]   They are everywhere.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.660]   And they are across all kinds of industries,
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.160]   industries that you wouldn't ever expect.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.880]   Some of these are large and quite visible.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.040]   For example, we know that there are thousands
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.240]   and thousands and thousands
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.440]   of mostly finished automobiles sitting in parking lots
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.780]   unfinished because manufacturers can't get computer chips.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.880]   Well, that's one little piece of data.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   And of course, that has ongoing ramifications.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.300]   The used vehicle market in the United States
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.860]   is totally whacked out because of this.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.560]   People are needing cars.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   And so used vehicle prices are up quite significantly
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   across the United States.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.580]   But it's also, you can find reports
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.680]   from many people for shortages on products
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.180]   as mundane as wooden pallets.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.380]   There's stuff everywhere of shortages.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.420]   If you go looking for the information,
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.460]   I've browsed, I don't know,
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.000]   chemicals are in short supply in some industries.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200]   It's just, there are widespread shortages right now.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.100]   There are lots of stories that you can find
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.880]   of ships stacked up outside of ports
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.480]   all around the United States.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.680]   None of these things are healthy trends.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.420]   They are quite concerning and worrying trends.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.220]   What's more worrying is these don't seem
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.060]   to be short-term problems that are easily fixable.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.500]   It doesn't seem like there's anything magic
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.260]   about the date October 4,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.540]   where all of a sudden by October 4,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.240]   everything is going to be fixed.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.840]   Rather, some of these problems are predicted
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.100]   to be continuing in different industries
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.880]   for perhaps even years before things
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.780]   can potentially be sorted out.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.840]   So I wanna bring you this as a warning,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.820]   that if there is some physical item
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.820]   that you know that you will need or want in the future,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.720]   I would recommend to you that you purchase it
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.060]   if you can find it and if it is available.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200]   If there is a physical item that you know
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.600]   that you will need or want,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.640]   I'd recommend that you purchase it
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   if you can find it available.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's hard to see an argument right now
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.480]   as to why in the short-ish term, short to medium term,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.260]   we can expect prices on many things to decline.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.780]   Right now, it seems far more probable
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.620]   that prices on most physical items will increase.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.640]   They will probably increase due to increased demand.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   Consumers adjusting the pricing in order to moderate
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.640]   that demand as they should.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.240]   Don't call it price gouging on here
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.640]   at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.380]   You know that we are firmly in favor of merchants
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.120]   being able to price their goods
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.580]   as the market makes appropriate.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.360]   But if these stresses and if these pressures continue,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.820]   there's a very good chance that prices will adjust.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.300]   There's also good reason to think that prices
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   may continue to adjust with future inflation.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   I have not been crying out large warnings about inflation
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.040]   because I still watch the median CPI
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.640]   and I wait for time to pass before paying attention
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.780]   to any one short-term number.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.920]   But there do seem to be increasing markers of inflation.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.620]   And so if we do wind up in an environment
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.520]   with increasing inflation,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.360]   then in that kind of environment,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360]   of course, currency or cash is less valuable.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   And one way to protect cash is to own physical items.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.880]   Especially durable physical items
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.080]   do not suffer from inflation.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.920]   So if you're not paying attention to this, you should.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.400]   What's the most actionable thing?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.480]   Well, things like Christmas presents.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.040]   If there's some particular thing
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.940]   that you have been planning to buy for Christmas,
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.880]   then this is a good time to go ahead and order it.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   If there's some particular thing
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.000]   that you've been on your list of stocking up,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.520]   this is a good time to order it.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.760]   I think that's the appropriate tone to take
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.080]   in this current situation.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.160]   I'm not saying that catastrophe is imminent.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.960]   I'm saying that there are tremendous pressures
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.120]   on supply chains all around the world.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   And those pressures are likely to have
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.600]   a continuing effect on the goods and products
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.400]   that you might wish to own in the future.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.920]   So think carefully about that.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.000]   And if there is something on your list
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   that's a physical item that you want or need,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   or that you know you're going to want or need in the future,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   this would be a good time to move
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.420]   that purchase date forward
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.980]   so that there's a higher probability
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.600]   that by the time you need it or want it,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.720]   that you will have it.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.580]   You'll have the thing that you need or want.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.480]   One of the things that is so fascinating to me to watch
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   about the situation as it has developed
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.000]   is that the current,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.200]   it's not wrong to call it a crisis.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.680]   Certainly a crisis, it's a strong word,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.720]   and I try to be very cautious in using that.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.240]   But in some industries, it really is a crisis.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.420]   So in some places, in some industries, crisis,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.020]   and some places, in some industries, pressures.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.160]   But in the current environment,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.120]   what's interesting to see is
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.480]   this is a very long, this has been,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.640]   and probably will continue to be,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   a very long and slowly unfolding event.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.140]   Meaning this is happening.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.200]   This is genuinely a difficult period,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   but it's not so acute.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.320]   It's not a one-day collapse.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.840]   Everything is unfolding slowly,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.000]   and the crisis continues to unfold slowly.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.880]   There are many reasons to be optimistic.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   It seems that we understand more and more
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.540]   what's gonna happen with the pandemic.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.480]   We understand more and more
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.080]   kind of the direction that things are going,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.880]   even if my previous optimism many months ago
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   was misplaced due to the effects of the Delta variant.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.240]   But this crisis is continuing to unfold
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.680]   with regard to the supply chains
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   and to the pressures that the supply chains are facing.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   So don't be lulled to sleep,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.640]   and don't be lulled to inaction
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.600]   due to watching, due to seeing
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.040]   how slowly this is unfolding.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.680]   The shortages are real.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.600]   I'm optimistic that the markets
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.720]   will be able to respond and to react.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   I have enjoyed watching this current crisis unfold
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.960]   because I've learned some valuable lessons.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.620]   On the one hand, as I have warned in the past,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.280]   the modern form of inventory management,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.200]   known as just-in-time inventory management,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.360]   is something that has tremendous dangers
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.400]   because most manufacturers,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   most stores don't have many reserves.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.000]   And so there's not a lot of slack in the system.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.760]   Most of the time, in today's world,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.480]   a perfectly run store, a perfectly run factory
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.440]   has goods coming in the back of the store
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.840]   at the same exact instant
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   that they're going out the front.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.520]   And the modern understanding
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.360]   of a perfect inventory management system
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   means that when you are ringing up your item
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   in Walmart at the cash register
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.320]   and getting ready to walk out the store,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.080]   the truck is unloading that item
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.120]   in the back of the store, and there's no slack.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.680]   It's immediately being replaced on the shelf.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.320]   And that's phenomenal for the efficiency of the system.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.160]   It is such a better system for keeping costs down,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   for keeping things running smoothly.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.320]   It's phenomenal.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.280]   And I have been amazed
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.320]   at how good modern inventory management systems really are.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.820]   And I think that we should acknowledge this
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.420]   because while there are dangers
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.280]   of the just-in-time inventory system,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.360]   we've seen so many crises come and go,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.340]   and we've seen how retailers and manufacturers
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.720]   have been able to adapt to those crises
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.200]   better than ever before.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.140]   You look at how when storms come through an area,
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.440]   you look at how quickly modern retailers
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.520]   are able to predict what's going to happen
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.360]   and send floods of goods in that direction.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.080]   And so on a regional basis,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.420]   I think we can see that the just-in-time inventory system
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.340]   is much more robust
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.360]   than many people have previously predicted.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.220]   What's happening is that slack
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.560]   has been taken out of the system at virtually all levels.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.460]   And now you're finding that it's much more difficult
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.860]   for many manufacturers, many distributors
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.280]   to deal with the big difficulties.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.540]   You can have a powerhouse of a retail brand like HEB
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.780]   who can predict and watch a hurricane coming in
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.660]   and can immediately divert all of its
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.580]   supply management system to deal with the needs
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.460]   that are gonna come in for that hurricane.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.760]   But it's much more difficult for that same retailer
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.440]   to be able to affect the pace at which
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.680]   the container ships that are bringing its goods from China
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.260]   are unloaded at the port of Los Angeles.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.680]   It's much more difficult for them
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   to have any real control over that.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.200]   And that's what we're seeing,
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.020]   is we're seeing major pressures across all levels
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   of the global distribution system,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.960]   and it's just bringing constant difficulties,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.520]   constant shortages.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.500]   And these shortages are affecting many businesses down line.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.140]   So I hope I've given you my warning,
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.620]   tried to say it clearly that if there's something
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.760]   that you need or want, and that you know
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.460]   you're going to need or want
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.500]   in the short or medium term future,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.740]   I would encourage you, go ahead and order it.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.120]   Go ahead and buy it.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.060]   Go through and do your Christmas shopping now
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.300]   so that if there's some particular thing
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.920]   that you really wanna have for Christmas,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.420]   that you can get it ordered and hopefully it'll be there.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.020]   There's really no downside if there's something
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.120]   that you're going to need or want.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.900]   There's really no downside to simply ordering it,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.260]   unless you just don't have any money,
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.780]   in which case, obviously, that's something
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.100]   that you don't want to do.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.780]   I'm not saying to buy something
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.620]   that you don't need or want.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.940]   But if there's something that you've been planning to do,
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.560]   don't hold back.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.940]   Look at your business carefully
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.460]   and take a look at your own supply chain.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.740]   If you haven't been paying attention
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.040]   to your own supply chains for your businesses,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.920]   then make sure that you're doing your best
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.640]   to protect yourself against any shortages
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.040]   and protect your family against not having the things
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.420]   that your family needs.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:30.560]   I don't think too much at this point in time
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.200]   about even, I don't,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.160]   I don't wish to engage in fear-mongering.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.520]   And so I'm trying to intentionally keep a cautious
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   but level tone in this.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.040]   I just want to encourage you, if you're not prepared,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.200]   if there's things in your life that if you didn't have it,
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.800]   that would be a major inconvenience
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.620]   or perhaps a major safety risk, get it.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.900]   Because it's better that you have it and not need it
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.400]   than that you need it and not have it.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.080]   And unfortunately, these issues are quite large
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.120]   and it seems that there's a very,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.920]   there are many good reasons to think
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.360]   that over the coming months, possibly even a year or two,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.920]   that may take a significant amount of time
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.360]   for supply chains to return to
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.800]   what we consider to be normal,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.220]   more smoothly functioning, fewer shortages, et cetera.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.820]   So hopefully it happens faster.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.060]   Hopefully there's no crisis at all.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.060]   Hopefully the shortages simply disappear very quickly.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.100]   I think that the good thing is we can appreciate that
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.180]   while the shortages are inconvenient,
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.060]   I don't hear any catastrophe stories, right?
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:58.060]   There's nobody who right now can't get any food,
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.800]   who needs food?
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.940]   There's still plenty of food available.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.140]   But be prepared.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.700]   This is the time to be prepared.
