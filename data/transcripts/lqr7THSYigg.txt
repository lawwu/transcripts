[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940]   "Yahweh is in His Holy Temple."
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.740]   For the choir director of David, "In Yahweh I take refuge.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.720]   How can you say to my soul, 'Flee, as a bird to your mountain?'
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.820]   For behold, the wicked bend the bow.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.180]   They make ready their arrow upon the string, to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.140]   If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.300]   Yahweh is in His Holy Temple, Yahweh's throne is in heaven.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.800]   His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.060]   Yahweh tests the righteous, but the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.140]   May He ring snares upon the wicked, fire and brimstone, and burning wind will be the portion
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.340]   of their cup.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.420]   For Yahweh is righteous, He loves righteousness.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.740]   The upright will behold His face."
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.740]   "Yahweh is in His Holy Temple."
