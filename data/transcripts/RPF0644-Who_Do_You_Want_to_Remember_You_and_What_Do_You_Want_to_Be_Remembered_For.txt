[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.460]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400]   Today on the show, philosophical show.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.900]   Let's begin with a question.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.740]   Who do you want to remember you
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.340]   when you are dead and gone?
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.380]   And what do you want to be remembered for?
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.460]   Who do you want to remember you when you are dead and gone?
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.220]   And what do you want to be remembered for?
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.560]   If you have a clear answer to those questions,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.900]   most of your life path will be charted out,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.940]   and somebody who knows you well will generally be able
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.040]   to predict the choices that you will make in life.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880]   If you don't have a clear answer to those questions,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.820]   you're going to need to spend some time thinking about them.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.820]   Don't despair.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.120]   A lot of times those questions take years to come up with,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.720]   and they crystallize more and more as time goes on.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.060]   These are not questions that you answer one time in life
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.320]   and things are settled for the rest of your life.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.820]   No, these are things that you think about continually
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460]   over the course of your life,
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.900]   and you make adjustments based upon your answers
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.440]   to these questions.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.080]   In life, you will have to make trade-offs,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.180]   and good decision-making is going to be driven
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.580]   based upon your being aware of the options
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.520]   that are available to you,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.220]   and then being aware of the personal philosophy,
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.460]   the personal ideals, the personal goals,
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.220]   the personal values that you bring to a decision
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.520]   so that you can make the best decision for you.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.100]   In almost any choice, the biggest cost you will face
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.460]   is the opportunity cost.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.600]   Opportunity cost is the thing that you give up
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.240]   when you make a choice.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.300]   If you come to a fork in the road
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.940]   and you choose to go left,
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.340]   the biggest cost of your choice of going left
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.280]   is what you're not going to see or do or have by going right.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.980]   That's your opportunity cost.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.160]   When you come to that fork in the road
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.460]   and you make your choice,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.760]   you are giving up everything to the right
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.020]   if you choose to go left.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.360]   But if you choose to go right,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200]   then of course you're giving up everything
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.960]   when you choose to go everything to the left.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.200]   To make one choice in life
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.540]   means often that you can't make another.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.340]   For example, if you say yes
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.140]   to taking the job at the local factory,
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.760]   because it's a job that will provide for your needs,
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.900]   it'll give you a secure form of employment, et cetera,
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.060]   you're not going to also be able
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.900]   to be an international journalist.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.340]   Those jobs are not going to work together.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.540]   If you take job A at the factory,
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.340]   you're saying no to job B as the international journalist.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.520]   But on the other hand,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   if you say yes to working as an international journalist,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.400]   then you're going to have to say no to other things.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.220]   For example, if you're taking a job
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.500]   as an international journalist,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.580]   you're not going to be able to work the land
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.400]   and heal the land that you own
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.600]   and develop your farm and care for your animals.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.680]   You can't simultaneously be a successful farmer
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.800]   caring for animals and be an international journalist.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   So you have to choose.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   And these choices are painful
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.760]   to most of us who are fairly capable.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.140]   Because if you're anything like me,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.520]   you look at the factory and you say,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.880]   man, I can see all the great things about the factory,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   and I would be a really good factory worker.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   But then you look at the international journalist job
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   and you say, man, look at that,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.720]   that would be really, really neat,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360]   I'd really like to do that.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   And then you look at the farming job
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.920]   and you think, I would really like to do that,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.200]   what a blessing it would be to be able to heal the land
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.780]   and care for the animals and care for the people.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.240]   It would just be wonderful to do that.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.960]   But you can't do them all.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.320]   You have to make a choice.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.900]   To excel in one area is necessarily going to mean
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.820]   that you're not going to excel equally in every other area.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.760]   If you're a capable person, you can do a lot,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.200]   but you can't do it all.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.600]   You can do well in many things,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.340]   but you can't do well in all things.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.360]   So you will have to choose.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.320]   And with most of these things,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.960]   there is no objective choice of right or wrong.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.440]   We could not make an argument that it is better,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.120]   objectively speaking, as an absolute standard,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.040]   that it's better to work at the factory,
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   or that it's better to work as the international journalist,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.680]   or it's better to work as a farmer.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.640]   Those things are not in the world of right and wrong,
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.320]   absolute standards of truth.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.680]   Rather, those are subjective things
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.360]   that are based upon your values, your lifestyle,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.440]   your skills, your goals, et cetera.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.400]   But you're going to have to choose.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.040]   And so you should, as Stephen Covey put so famously,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.760]   you should begin with the end in mind.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.680]   And a good way to get there is to think about
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.160]   who do you want to remember you,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.080]   and what do you want to be remembered for?
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.840]   Who do you want to remember you?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.480]   You will have to choose the people
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.680]   that you are going to spend your life with,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   and commit to spending time with those people
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.980]   in order for them to remember you.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.560]   If you choose your family,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.080]   and you choose to spend time and energy and money
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.500]   on activities with your family,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.400]   you will have to say no to other people.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   This is why if you choose to marry,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   you're automatically going to spend less time
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.200]   with your friends,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   because you're gonna spend time with your spouse.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.240]   If you have children,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.200]   you're going to spend less time with your coworkers,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.440]   because you're gonna spend more time with your children.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   So it's a choice.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   If you choose your family,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.120]   you'll have to say no to others.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   If you choose your friends,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.640]   you will have to say no to others.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.760]   Or if you choose to spend time with your coworkers,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.480]   you'll have to say no to your family and friends.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.160]   If you choose your customers,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.120]   you'll have to say no to your coworkers.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.520]   And in order for you to make that choice,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.240]   you're gonna have to be clear
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.600]   on who you want to remember you,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.720]   and what you want to be remembered for.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.440]   I always thought about this
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.760]   when I used to work as a financial advisor.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   And in the world of financial product sales,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.560]   you sell an insurance, investments,
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.360]   doing financial planning,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.960]   there's this fascinating little thing
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   that some people seem to figure out.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.280]   But your coworkers don't buy from you.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.320]   And I could never understand
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   why people would spend so much time around the office,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.080]   spending all kinds of time with people
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.520]   who were never gonna buy anything from them,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.240]   instead of going out and spending time with customers
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.720]   who were gonna buy from them.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   And at least how I would prioritize it,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.080]   I'm gonna spend time with customers
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.200]   who are gonna buy from me.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.040]   You spend a little bit of time at the office
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.040]   with the coworkers,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.240]   because of course there's the politics of the office,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   et cetera.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.440]   But I'd rather be with either customers or my family
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.520]   and friends rather than with coworkers.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.720]   Well, maybe today I can,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.920]   it's funny, I have a lot of friends
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   and it's funny, I have relationships still
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.720]   with my family and friends and my customers,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.160]   but not many with coworkers.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.480]   I guess it's kind of normal.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.320]   That's what I chose.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.080]   I chose to be remembered by those people.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.000]   The point is, you can't spend time
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.800]   with everybody all at the same time.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.760]   So you're going to have to choose.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.560]   Think about who you want to remember you
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.840]   when you're dead and gone,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   or when you leave town,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.120]   or whatever timeframe you can picture.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.000]   Who do you want to remember you
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.680]   when you graduate from high school?
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   Who do you want to remember you
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.680]   when you graduate from college?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.800]   Who do you want to remember you
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.280]   when you close down this business
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.160]   and start your next one?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.400]   And what do you want to be remembered for?
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.240]   You're going to have to be clear
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.600]   on what you want people to say about you
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.160]   when you're gone,
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.600]   because you will have to live that out now.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.720]   You'll have to live, I hate the word, authentically.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   You won't fool the people that are closest to you.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.520]   You cannot.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.960]   Your wife will know who you are.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.080]   You cannot fool her.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.520]   Your children will know who you are.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   You cannot fool them.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.600]   Your business partner will know who you are.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.760]   You can't fool them.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.920]   You won't fool those people.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.840]   And so you're going to have to live it out.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   Now here's what's cool about life,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.320]   and I'll wrap up with this.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.480]   In life, there are many things that you can do.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.960]   You have many options of things that you can choose to do.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.040]   And you can spend massive amounts of time
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.920]   considering those options.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.120]   You can take in all kinds of input,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.420]   of ways that you can improve things,
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.440]   other people's paths,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.320]   and it's never been easier to hear other people's stories.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.680]   So don't say yes to one life course too quickly
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   before you've considered the options.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.840]   But then, if you're actually gonna make a difference,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.880]   you're actually gonna have to say yes
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.400]   to one course of action.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.460]   And that's going to come at a cost.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.320]   You're gonna give up other things.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.440]   You say yes to marriage,
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.640]   you're going to be saying no to late night sessions
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   with your friends at the beer hall.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   Say yes to a sales job,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.400]   you're going to be saying no to spending lots of time
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.000]   in your local office just hanging out,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.440]   chatting with your coworkers.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.200]   And every choice, you fill in the examples,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.140]   I don't need to go on forever.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.000]   So think carefully,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   and use the opportunities that you're given to say,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.320]   to get ideas about how you'd like to be remembered.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.440]   Who do you want to remember you,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.000]   and what do you want to remember them before?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.640]   But don't be scared to commit
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.540]   once you know the direction that you want to go.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.040]   I don't think I want to belabor the point
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.520]   of this show any more than that.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.680]   So I'll just simply allow you to fill in more details,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.440]   but think about those questions.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.880]   Who do you want to remember you when you're dead and gone,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.200]   and what do you want to be remembered for?
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.760]   And my hope is that if you'll think about those questions,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.920]   you'll gain increasing clarity about the answers.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.520]   Then you'll have a useful tool to bring to the options
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.280]   that life presents to you as you consider those options.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.960]   Be back with you soon.

[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.440]   with founder and organic pioneer, David Stelzer.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.200]   - Sometimes it is easy to see the scarcity in our lives,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   but I tell you that God created enough abundance for all.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.160]   Sometimes we just have to work for it a little bit.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.840]   So create abundance in the areas of your life
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.760]   that matter most, in your health, in your homes,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.320]   in your relationships and families.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.600]   Those are the important things.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.240]   Here at Azure, our job is to create abundance

[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.800]   And as you create abundance in all the areas
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.120]   that matter in your life,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.080]   remember that God made an abundant world.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.920]   - That was David's Corner presented by David Stelzer,
