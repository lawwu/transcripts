[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:27.000]   Because if you're anything like me, you look at the factory and you say, ï¿½Man, I can see all the great things about the factory, and I would be a really good factory worker.ï¿½ But then you look at the international journalist job and you say, ï¿½Man, look at that. That would be really, really neat. I really like to do that.ï¿½ And then you look at the farming job and you think, ï¿½I would really like to do that. What a blessing it would be to be a farmer.ï¿½

[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   my customers, but not many with coworkers. I guess it's kind of normal. That's what I chose. I chose to be remembered by those people. The point is you can't, you can't spend time with everybody all at the same time.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.140]   So you're going to have to choose.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:34.680]   Think about who you want to remember you when you're dead and gone or when you leave town or whatever timeframe you can picture.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.220]   Who do you want to remember you?
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:09:05.920]  , when you graduate from high school? Who do you want to remember you when you graduate from college? Who do you want to remember you when you close down this business and start your next one? And what do you want to be remembered for? You're going to have to be clear on what you want people to say about you when you're gone because you will have to live that out now. You have to live, I hate the word, authentically. You won't fool the people that are closest to you.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.960]   You cannot.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:18.340]   Your wife will know who you are. You cannot fool her. Your children will know who you are. You cannot fool them. Your business partner will know who you are. You can't fool them.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.880]   You won't fool those people. And so you're going to have to live it out.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:34.500]   Now here's what's cool about life and I'll wrap up with this. In life, there are many things that you can do. You have many options of things that you can choose to do.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.860]   You have many options of things that you can choose to do.
