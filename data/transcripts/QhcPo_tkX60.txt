[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.480]   - Here's an email from a long time listener named Sharon.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.000]   Dear Pastor John, I have listened to every episode
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   of Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.280]   - Good night.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.100]   - Yes, wow, and countless sermons over the years
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.880]   at DesiringGod.org and I love what the Lord has done
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.800]   through you in my life and in the life of my children.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.640]   Thank you.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.860]   My question, what role do feelings and emotions play
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.280]   in the decisions of the believer?
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.760]   I desperately try to lead my heart with my mind,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.400]   but the heart holds so many feelings and emotions
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.740]   that inform us and seemingly drive us
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.280]   in different directions through life.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   On things like career choice,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.320]   attraction to a spouse, et cetera.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440]   So what role should our feelings play
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.140]   in our decision making?
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.660]   - Thank you, Sharon, for your trust.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.660]   I mean, it makes me tremble to think 500 pieces of counsel,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680]   how many times must I have gotten things
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.040]   a little bit skewed that I hope I don't mess her up too much.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.900]   Here's my effort.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.900]   The answer to the magnitude of the role of the emotions
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.720]   in our decision making is this, massive, big.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.280]   It is a big role in our decisions,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.020]   whether we want them to or not,
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500]   and whether we know it or not.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.160]   And here's something even more,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.320]   even more significant, I think,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.460]   than the fact that our emotions play
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.960]   in our decision making about what to do,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.620]   they play a role even more powerfully
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.260]   in the thousand things we do every day
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.880]   that we don't make a decision to do.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.480]   I mean, yeah, maybe 10 times during the day,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.340]   you step back and have a hard decision
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.220]   and think it through with the pros and cons.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.760]   And then there are 10,000 facial expressions
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.380]   and tones of voice and gestures
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.860]   and things that really make a moral difference in the world
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.940]   that you didn't give any premeditated thought to whatsoever.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.020]   Where are those thoughts coming from?
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.300]   I mean, where are those actions coming from?
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.540]   Well, they're coming out of the abundance of the heart.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.860]   The mouth is speaking and the face,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.380]   the eyebrows are going up or the mouth is frowning
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.220]   or the gestures are acting
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.340]   or the body language is leaning away or leaning in.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.420]   And oh my goodness, we are who we are
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.540]   quite apart from premeditated decisions.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140]   Oh my, if I could devote energy
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.840]   to becoming the kind of person
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.020]   whose spontaneous acts were godly
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.260]   and loving and upbuilding and kind,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.100]   I wouldn't worry too much about my decisions.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.860]   I mean, 'cause that's such a small part of my life.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.680]   I mean, people tend to feel like their decision
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.500]   are the big parts of their life.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.700]   They're not the main parts of their lives.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.740]   We are who we are by the spontaneous overflow.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.500]   So out of the abundance of the heart,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.060]   the mouth is speaking, the face is smiling,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.500]   frowning, arms are gesturing,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900]   the tones of voice are on and on and on.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.380]   So we better focus.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.620]   So the point of all this is we better focus
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.620]   on our attention to becoming a kind of person
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620]   not perfecting a kind of list
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.460]   or a kind of rational set of criteria
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.960]   by which we will hone our reasoning skills
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.900]   and make all of our important decisions.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.980]   That list will never be long enough to cover everything.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.700]   And the heart acts before we could consult it anyway
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.940]   on most of the things we do
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.540]   than before we engage in any reasoning process.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.500]   That heart is a profound set of feelings
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.740]   and commitments and convictions and preferences.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.740]   So Proverbs says, "Keep your heart with all vigilance
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.100]   for out of it flow the springs of life."
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.620]   And that heart includes emotions big time.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.260]   But Sharon is not asking mainly about that.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.820]   She's asking about decisions where we do think over
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.660]   what we should do, what role do feelings play there.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.420]   So let me go to the most standard text
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.660]   and draw out a couple of things.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.140]   Do not be conformed, this is Romans 12, two.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.980]   Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.020]   but be transformed by the renewal of your mind
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.580]   that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.480]   what is good, acceptable, and perfect.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.740]   What does the renewal of the mind
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.660]   for the sake of decision-making involve?
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.660]   And verse two says that the effect of this renewal
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.620]   is that we approve.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.940]   Now the Greek word, dokimazo,
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.940]   never means merely do something, it means approve it.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.700]   That is you do it because you assess it and you approve it.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.140]   And that concept of approving is a valuing.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.140]   This is more than mere rational response to an act.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.900]   This is a moral weighing of an act
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.980]   by virtue of the preferences,
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.700]   the approval capacities of your soul.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.980]   The word always includes a measure of approval,
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.620]   not just discernment.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.620]   It means recognize and prefer or approve,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.940]   want more than other things,
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.880]   treasure more than other things,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.220]   which means that the renewal of the mind
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.220]   that produces that kind of refining of rational processes
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.100]   is more than that.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.980]   It's the renewal of our preferences, our desires,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.600]   our longings, our deepest wants.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.500]   That goes into the renewing of the mind.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.660]   And the confirmation of that for me is over in Ephesians 4
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.140]   where Paul says, "Be renewed in the,"
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.580]   in this amazing phrase, "spirit of your minds."
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.420]   I always wonder, what is that?
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.060]   Being renewed in your minds all sounds intellectual.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.300]   Being renewed in the spirit of your minds is,
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   oh, when Paul talks about mind and the renewal of the mind,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.820]   he's got more in mind than merely rational capacities.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.740]   This mind has a spirit, it has a bench.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.620]   Like, let this mind be in you,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.980]   which was also in Christ Jesus
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.980]   who made this massive approved decision to humble himself.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.060]   Now, why does that matter?
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.660]   In Ephesians, five verses earlier,
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.740]   Paul tells us why it matters
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.040]   that we be renewed in the spirit of our mind.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.060]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.180]   The Gentiles are darkened in their understanding,
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.040]   alienated from the life of God
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.780]   because of the ignorance that is in them
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.780]   due to the hardness of their heart.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.760]   So if you walk with Paul down, down, down,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.740]   deep into the root of things,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.920]   you might've thought he would end by saying
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.860]   they're alienated from God
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.740]   and they're darkened in their understanding
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.620]   because of the ignorance that is in them, period.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.100]   So let's get about changing ignorance.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.700]   And that's not where he stops.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.060]   He says because of the ignorance that is in them
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.340]   due to the hardness of their heart.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.100]   Beneath the intellectual problem of ignorance of God
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.660]   is the moral problem, the emotional problem of the heart.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.520]   It is hard against God.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.220]   So the reason the mind must be renewed
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.700]   so that it can decide good things
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   in the spirit of the mind is not just rational or factual.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.540]   That's not our deepest problem.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.780]   Our deepest problem is feelings and preferences,
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.060]   not reasoning.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.080]   Reasoning is affected by sin, for sure,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.460]   but the deepest problem is our hard heart.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.720]   So my conclusion from this
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.260]   is not that we check our minds at the door
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.940]   when we enter the house of wisdom,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.900]   like, oh, thinking doesn't matter here.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.660]   I've got some emotions to deal with.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.800]   No, that's not where I'm going.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   But that we realize that every decision,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.260]   the ones that she mentioned,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.260]   every decisions are a complex response of heart and head
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.720]   or this spirit of the mind.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.300]   And that's okay.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.340]   I want her to feel okay about that
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.420]   'cause she seems to be worried
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.540]   that if her emotions are involved,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.460]   that might mess things up.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.980]   We are to be renewed in both.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.460]   Neither is perfect.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.540]   The rational faculties are not perfect
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.520]   and the emotional faculties are not perfect,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.380]   and neither is useless.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.940]   When the mind has done what it can do
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.020]   in discerning the pros and the cons of a situation,
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.380]   so I think that's what you should do,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.940]   weighs the pros and cons of job possibilities
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.380]   and by all means, spouse who you're gonna marry and so on.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.060]   That's not wrong to weigh the possibilities with your mind.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.980]   The psalmist says, however,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.960]   delight yourself in the Lord
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.260]   and the Lord will give you the desires of your heart.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.140]   So when you have done all the rational weighing you can,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.980]   the renewal of your mind being deep
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.900]   is centered on delighting in God
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.920]   and therefore those desires that grow up,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.940]   they're not negligible.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.200]   They should be paid attention to
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.340]   as they accord with God's will.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.160]   - That is gold.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.380]   And thank you for the superb question, Sharon.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.340]   Sharon has listened to every APJ episode.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.980]   That's about 68 hours worth of audio recordings.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.940]   Wow.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.500]   And if you wanna listen to all of them
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   or if you wanna listen to just a few select episodes
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.180]   or if you just wanna listen to the top 10
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.020]   most popular episodes all time,
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.980]   you can do that from our landing page online
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.180]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.360]   And there, look for the buttons where you can toggle
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.820]   between recent episodes and popular episodes.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.660]   Well, we are gonna break for the weekend.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.020]   On Monday, a podcast listener named Bryce
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.900]   wants to know how can we trust the Bible?
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.820]   And John Piper will have an answer.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.380]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:07.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
