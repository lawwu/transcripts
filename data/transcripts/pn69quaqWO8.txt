[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.100]   We're gonna end the week with a simple question
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.120]   and often the best ones are.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.280]   Pamela Kahn, a listener to the podcast,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.980]   simply asks this, "Pastor John, what is worship?"
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760]   - Let's start with the inner essence of worship
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.060]   and then work out to the more public expressions
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.800]   of worship services or daily acts of love,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   which Paul calls our spiritual worship.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.720]   The reason I make the distinction
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.060]   between the inner essence of worship
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.580]   and the external expression of it
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.120]   is because I think Jesus did in Matthew 15, eight.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   "This people honors me with their lips,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.180]   but their heart is far from me.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.140]   In vain do they worship me."
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.080]   So for Jesus, worship amounts to zero.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.480]   That's what vain means.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.680]   In vain they worship me.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080]   Zero, it's not worship.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.240]   It's a zero worship.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.240]   It's zero if there's no heart dimension to it.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.320]   So you can do as many deeds as you want
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.720]   and go to as many church services as you want
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.360]   and never be worshiping if it's all external
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.920]   and nothing is happening in your heart toward God.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   So all true worship is in essence a matter of the heart.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.380]   It's more, more, but it's not less.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.440]   So then the question becomes,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.800]   what is this inner authentic Godward experience
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.420]   of the heart that we call the essence of worship?
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.160]   And Jesus pointed us toward an answer in John 4, 23 and 24
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.240]   when he said, "The hour is coming and is now here."
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.280]   He's here.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.720]   "When the true worshipers will worship the Father
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.740]   in spirit and truth,
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.600]   for the Father is seeking such people to worship him."
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.760]   God is spirit.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.960]   "And those who worship him must worship in spirit
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.780]   and in truth."
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.780]   Now notice that worshiping in spirit
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.360]   is not contrasted with worshiping in the body
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880]   or with the body.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   Instead, it's put alongside worshiping in truth.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.520]   So what would that mean?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   That we are to be spirit worshipers,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   worshiping from the spirit and truth, driven by truth.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.600]   Well, I think the point is that when we worship,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   right worship, good worship, pleasing worship
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.840]   depends on a right mental grasp
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.100]   of the way God really is, truth.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.600]   If we worship an idol of our own creation,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.220]   we're not really worshiping God.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.080]   And secondly, worship depends on a right spiritual
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   or emotional or affectional heart grasp
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.520]   of God's supreme value.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.160]   So true worship is based on a right understanding
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   of God's nature and it is a right valuing of God's worth.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.340]   And of course, his worth is infinite.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.740]   And thus true worship is a valuing
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.820]   or a treasuring of God above all things.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.820]   That'd be the closest I'm gonna give to a definition,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.660]   I suppose.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.660]   True worship is a valuing or a treasuring of God
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.060]   above all things.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.380]   So the inner essence of worship is the response
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.620]   of the heart to the knowledge of the mind
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.060]   when the mind is rightly understanding God
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.440]   and the heart is rightly valuing God.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   Or you could use words like treasuring or prizing God
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   or delighting in God or reverencing God
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.860]   or being satisfied with God.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.640]   All of these inner responses to God
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.200]   reflect his infinite worth and beauty.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560]   And that's what worship was designed to do,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.720]   put the supreme worth of God on display.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   In fact, the English word worship comes from worth-ship.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.600]   That is, worship is showing, displaying the worth of God.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   So we worship God authentically when we know him truly
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.800]   and treasure him duly.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Then the word worship refers to that valuing,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.140]   that inner valuing becoming visible in the world
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.480]   in two basic ways in the New Testament.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   One is acts of the mouth, acts of praise and repentance
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.280]   in worship services or small group gatherings.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.300]   And the other is acts of love with the body
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.880]   and the hands and the feet,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.480]   acts of love that show the supreme value of God
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   by what we're willing to sacrifice for the good of others.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   And I get those two things from Hebrews 13:15-16.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   Listen to this amazing summary.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.240]   It says, "Through him then," through Christ,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.120]   "let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   Do not neglect to do good, to share what you have,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   for such sacrifices are pleasing to God."
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.440]   So those two verses begin and end with the term sacrifice.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.280]   And of course, the sacrifice is a echo
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.600]   from the Old Testament sacrifices,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.720]   which was the center of the worship
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.160]   and was to display the value of God
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.020]   as we gave up a bull or a goat
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.980]   and showed that God is precious to us
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.480]   and we value his redemption
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.480]   that comes to us through the sacrifice
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.560]   and now through the sacrifice of Christ.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.120]   So through Christ,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.600]   two things become worshipful sacrifices in our life.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.220]   The fruit of lips that acknowledge his name,
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.920]   that's worship services and singing and praying
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.060]   and repenting and confessing.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.520]   And secondly, the fruit of deeds.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.240]   Don't neglect to do good, share what you have,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.860]   So both of those are acts of worship.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.520]   You see it again in Romans 12, one.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.060]   "I appeal to you therefore, brothers,
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.100]   by the mercies of God,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.240]   present your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.680]   holy and acceptable,
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   which is your spiritual service of worship."
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.480]   So all of our bodily life done in love for others
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.260]   and in reliance upon God,
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.600]   display the worth of God above all things
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.580]   and make us worshipers in our daily life.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.640]   So here's my summary.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.880]   The inner essence of worship is to know God truly
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.760]   and then respond from the heart to that knowledge
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.500]   by valuing God, treasuring God,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.480]   prizing God, enjoying God,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.720]   being satisfied with God above all earthly things.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   And then that deep, restful, joyful satisfaction in God
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.860]   overflows in demonstrable acts of praise from the lips
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.280]   and demonstrable acts of love
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.040]   in serving others for the sake of Christ.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   - Beautiful.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.280]   That's a robust survey of a theme at the very core
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.060]   of why God made us and what desiring God is all about.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.420]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.380]   We are gonna break for the weekend now.

[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.860]   Well, Pastor John has a new book that launches next week.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.660]   It's titled "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.780]   It's a noteworthy book
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.220]   and it will be our theme all next week.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.500]   And on Monday, I'll ask him about money, sex, and power
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.980]   and what makes him think of these things
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.860]   in a completely new light.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.700]   We'll talk about that.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.660]   Don't miss it.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
