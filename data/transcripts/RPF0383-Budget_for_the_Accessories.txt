[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.020]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.800]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.820]   Today we have Radical Personal Finance short, a very simple personal finance concept that
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.340]   I want to share with you.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.920]   The title of today's show is Budget for the Accessories.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.320]   Now this is coming from both failure and success on my part.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.680]   Failure in that many times I've not budgeted for the accessories and lived to regret it.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.260]   And success, and sometimes I have and I have been very pleased with the results.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.420]   The concept of budget for the accessories is extremely simple.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.700]   If you're going to purchase something, whether that's an item, a service, whatever, make
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.860]   sure that you're not calculating your budget based simply upon the price of the object.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.140]   Make sure that you're not setting a target figure such as I'm going to spend $500 and
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.780]   then purchasing on the single item or service the full $500 worth.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.440]   Make sure that you're holding back enough room in your budget to cover the accessories
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   for that item.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.560]   Because if you think about it, for most items, at least the examples I can come up with,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:34.440]   the accessories are just as important or very important at the least to the value that you
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.040]   get from that item.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.920]   Now I'm going to give you a half a dozen examples here going from as simple as a cell
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.140]   phone and my last example will be talking about your house, about how to think through
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.740]   the budget that you make for your house.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.820]   But the idea here is for you to think about something in terms of its utility.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.380]   Let's talk about a cell phone because that's the most ubiquitous example I can come up
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.620]   with where every single one of you either has a phone or is probably listening to me
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.800]   on your phone right now.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.060]   So Apple or Samsung or Blackberry or whomever you like comes out with their latest, greatest
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.580]   brand new phone and these things are expensive.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.420]   I mean, $1,000 easily for one of these new top of the line phones.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.940]   Let's say that you're looking through your budget and you decide, "Well, I actually have
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.980]   $1,000 that I could spend on a phone."
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.580]   Question is, should you go and spend $1,000 on the phone?
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.720]   I don't think you should because if you do, the only thing you'll have is the phone.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.380]   A better plan is probably to budget something like $600 or $700 for the phone and $300 or
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.980]   $400 for the accessories.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.980]   Let's talk about some simple ones.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.980]   Probably the most useful, most valuable accessory that you can have for your phone is the case.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.380]   Many of you purchase these mobile phone insurance programs, things like that.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.900]   The cheapest form of insurance is to get a high quality, well-built phone case.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.840]   If you've never looked around this market, here's a little bit of consumer information
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   for you.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.260]   You can find cases that are decorative and slightly protective or you can find cases
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.980]   that are extremely protective.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.700]   There are different standards of protection.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.180]   I recommend to you that if you're shopping for a phone case, you try to get one of the
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.460]   ones that usually goes under the idea of ballistic protection.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.380]   It passes one of the drop tests that they do where it can survive a repeated two meter
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.380]   fall.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.500]   The phone is six point ... It's two meters, I think about six and a half feet.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.700]   Six and a half feet off the ground, you can drop the phone and the case has a sufficient
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.180]   suspension system built into it where it'll cushion the fall and keep your screen from
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.740]   breaking, keep the phone from breaking on a repeated basis.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.560]   That's actually the type of case that I have.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.060]   If you're interested in a specific model, when I was doing all the research for my phone,
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.860]   I discovered a case that I really like.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.660]   It's called the Thule Atmos X3.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.540]   Thule, the same company that makes those car top carriers, T-H-U-L-E, Atmos, A-T-M-O-S,
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.020]   and mine is the X3 brand version.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.020]   I really like it.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   I'll link to it.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.940]   I just made a note to link to it in the notes for today if you want to buy it on Amazon.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.940]   They're super cheap now.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.220]   When I bought it, it was 30, 40 bucks, something like that.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.100]   The phone, it's been great.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.020]   It covers the phone and gives it protection from a two meter drop.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.180]   It does a tremendous job of protecting the phone, but it's still very thin.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.580]   It still slides easily in and out of my pocket.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.820]   It's very comfortable to hold.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.580]   It makes the iPhone that I use extremely firm in your hand where the original model without
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.180]   a case is not that way.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.200]   But it has that really high quality ballistic protection.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Really love it.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.100]   I bought my wife one as well when we got her a new phone.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.620]   It does a great job.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.740]   There are many others as well.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.700]   If you are in a very dangerous environment, you're a construction worker, you work on
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.100]   a boat, et cetera, then you'll want to go for one of the waterproof versions of the
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.900]   phone cases unless you're getting one of these newer phones that are very well waterproofed.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.100]   I don't like the waterproof because I don't like having something on the screen and I
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.960]   don't really spend that much time where I need the screen protection.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.660]   But that case will give you a tremendous usefulness of the phone and it's worth budgeting for
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.660]   that.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.500]   So let's say that your budget for the phone were realistically $1,000.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.620]   If you've got to spend 10 to 20 to $50 on a case, you've got to pull that off of that.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.100]   Well, what else?
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.100]   I've learned over time that the first thing I should do when I get a new device is make
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.140]   sure that I have proper accessories for it.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.780]   So the most useful accessory after the case is chargers.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.940]   So when I upgraded from phones that were requiring USB connection to lightning connection, I
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.900]   didn't just simply stick with the one lightning cable that came with the phone.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.620]   I went ahead and purchased a half a dozen new USB lightning cables.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.300]   And I really have gained tremendous benefit from doing this.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.180]   Now this is going to be...this is a perfect fit for a #firstworldproblems.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.180]   But here's what I do.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:27.500]   I have a high quality cigarette lighter adapter in all three of my vehicles.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.620]   And by high quality, I mean not the cheapy dollar store one that you can get that doesn't
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.220]   put out enough amperage to charge the phone, but one that does put out a high current,
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.980]   high voltage, high amperage or voltage, I'm blanking on my electrical theory at the moment,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.660]   puts out a lot of current to charge the phone quickly.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.180]   If you try to run a big phone and you're trying to do something like I do, I often will use
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.140]   a GPS app on the phone.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.100]   My favorite is an app called Waze, W-A-Z-E.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.060]   If you're not familiar with Waze, it's a free app that is completely big brother snooping
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.540]   in your life and it is really hard to say no.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.740]   Because what the Waze app does, again, W-A-Z-E, is it uses all of the user data on your phone
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.460]   and it uses all of the other people who are using the app to give real-time GPS information
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.580]   to help you get real-time traffic information about if you're sitting in a traffic jam,
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.380]   how long the traffic jam is going to be, or even better, it'll reroute you around the
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.720]   traffic jam based upon how big the traffic jam is.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.540]   It's really great because it's pulling that real-time data from all of the user's phones.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.780]   It's a really good app.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.020]   I usually drive with that on because it helps me to avoid traffic problems when I'm going
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.180]   somewhere.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.480]   I find that to be a really useful feature.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.280]   The other thing I like about it is you can turn on a little alert, which sounds a tone
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.300]   if you exceed the posted speed limit in a zone.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.660]   I like to do that because if I ever exceed this posted speed limit, I want the alert
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.340]   so I can drop my speed back down.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.500]   I don't like to pay speeding tickets, a little personal finance thing, and I generally have
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.620]   no reason to ever be in a hurry.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.620]   I use the Waze app.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.780]   Well, if you have one of those cheap drugstore, dollar store things, chargers, if you have
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.420]   your screen on with a big phone, a cheap dollar store cable and a cheap dollar store cigarette
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.580]   lighter doesn't deliver enough current to the phone to even maintain the battery, let
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.060]   alone charge it.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.620]   If you get a high-quality cable and a high-quality cigarette lighter adapter, you can get in
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.860]   and you get in the car and your phone's at 50% and you plug that thing in and you're
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.820]   using the screen, talking on it all the while, and when you get out of the car sometime later,
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.180]   it'll be 75%, 80%, perhaps 90% or 100%.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.060]   I have a habit that anytime I'm in a vehicle, I'm charging my phone.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.460]   Your phone is usually one of your most important, most valuable accessories in your life.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.180]   Want me?
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:56.980]   If you left your phone behind when you leave your house, how many of you would go back
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.660]   and get it or have gone back and gotten it?
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.180]   Most of us, we've gone back and gotten it.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.980]   Most of us, if we leave it behind, we would at least seriously consider it.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.900]   Now, I can't think of anything else that if you left behind, you'd be that tempted to
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   go back and get.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.340]   You leave your wallet behind, "Well, I probably need, but I can get by."
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.740]   You leave your socks behind, "Well, I'll just be sockless today."
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.500]   Easier for some of us in Florida than some of you guys up in the north.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.620]   The phone is a valuable accessory.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.820]   All of these lighter adapters and the high-quality cable in each of the cars makes it so that
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.300]   my phone is always very well charged, so I don't have to worry about it running out of
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   juice.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.860]   I don't want to worry about it being down at 10% or 15% or running out when I need it.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.560]   That dramatically improves the usefulness of the phone by having all those electrical
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   cables in all the cars.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.500]   That dramatically just makes me actually have it.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.620]   Back to the point where I said you're better to buy a cheaper phone, it's better to have
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.600]   a cheaper phone, maybe a little less memory or a camera that's not quite as high quality
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.620]   that's actually charged and working when you need it than to have an expensive phone, but
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.180]   you blew all your money on the phone and you didn't have the money to keep it charged all
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.260]   the time.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.340]   I know I'm laboring on the cell phone, but I'm trying to give you some practical tips
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.540]   because I know all of you have phones, but also to use this as a broader metaphor for
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.820]   other things in your life.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.980]   So I invest, it's a little bit weird to use that word, but I think it's accurate.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:34.220]   I invest in high-quality cigarette lighter plugs and cables for each of the cars.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.780]   And if you're married or you have other people, you might want to go ahead and have two.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.340]   I like to carry an extra cable in the car for other devices.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.620]   So friends have a USB phone, things like one that charges, an Android that charges with
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.620]   a USB cable.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.140]   It's nice to have a USB cable or a simple adapter.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.540]   There are a couple of simple ways to do that.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.500]   I'll skip past it for now.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.680]   But I also like to have cables that stay in other places in my house.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.740]   So I like to have a cable that's on my desk so my phone can be charged when I'm at my
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.740]   desk.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.260]   I like to have a cable that's charged by my bed if I put my phone by my bed.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.700]   Sometimes I do that, sometimes I leave it in the office overnight, you get better sleep
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.980]   that way.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.820]   I like to have also a separate cable and adapter that's set up in my travel kit.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.780]   And that way when I'm traveling and I'm packing, I can pack in about 15 minutes because I just
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.820]   have a separate dop kit that has all of my toiletries in it and it has a standalone charger
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.980]   and adapter and cables and all of that for electronic devices.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.100]   It costs a little bit of money, but it's a one-time purchase that you can use for a very
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.320]   long time until they change the adapter, which is going to be a number of years at least.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.140]   And it gains so much value for me of having the benefit of always having the phone charged,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.420]   always having the phone and not having to unplug a cable from here and take it from
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420]   there.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.420]   It's just very, very simple.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.500]   It costs a little bit of money.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.140]   I have found that it's one of those things that's been very helpful for me.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.140]   Well, what else?
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.020]   What other accessories are useful with a phone?
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.000]   What about car mounts, having a nice mount in your car?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Makes a big difference.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.700]   If you don't have a high quality mount that sticks to your dash or that's just screwed
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.900]   into your dash or that hangs from your mirror or something like that, you're not getting
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.620]   the full benefit of the phone.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.380]   If you just have to look down in the cup holder that's dangerous, you can't use some of the
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.900]   GPS functions, et cetera, as well as you can otherwise.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.180]   And so go ahead and spend and get a high quality, it doesn't have to be expensive, but you're
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.900]   going to spend $10 to $30 for a high quality mounting system.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.280]   And you can get a mounting system that's very convenient, one of these nice magnet ones
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.420]   or something similar.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.300]   Adds a lot of value to the phone.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.620]   I'd rather have a slightly cheaper phone and a mount in my car where I can use that phone
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.980]   for its functions such as GPS, such as safely managing audio files while I'm driving down
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.300]   the road than a more expensive phone that I have to stick down in the glove box or stick
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.160]   down in the cup holder.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.860]   Other batteries, I've mentioned on the recent hurricane show how important cell phone batteries
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860]   are.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.780]   I think that all of you should have at least two high quality lithium ion batteries as
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.520]   far as battery backups.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.900]   Very simple, we should have one that goes into your pocket or your purse, a small type
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.940]   of lipstick case or one of the small flat ones if you're a guy.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.500]   Me as a guy, I like to have one of the small thinner battery cases.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:29.380]   If you're a girl, for my wife, kind of the lipstick, more tubular design works better
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.780]   for her purse.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.700]   That way if you're out and you're not near a car, you're not near your house and you
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:41.380]   do like me where you actually use your phone a lot, the batteries don't last a full day.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.040]   So it's nice to have that charger and a little cable there to be able to plug it in and charge
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   it up.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:53.980]   I also think it's really valuable when traveling or when out and doing a lot of work or when
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   you're doing emergency preparations to have a nice high capacity 15,000 milliamp hour,
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.100]   18,000 milliamp hour, 20,000 milliamp hour battery that you use that can go in your pocket
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.420]   and recharge your phone a half a dozen to a dozen times.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.380]   These batteries are really valuable to have.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:18.100]   And so I'd rather have that phone and those accessories to keep it using, to keep it going
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.460]   than the more expensive phone.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.860]   Cheaper phone, more accessories, better in my opinion.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.460]   Now that's really phone centric.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.460]   I'm using that example because I think it's something that you can probably relate to.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.580]   Most of us who use smartphones use them a lot.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.780]   And I always scratch my head when I see somebody with a thousand dollar phone that ran out
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:45.060]   of juice because they didn't plan ahead to have juice.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.460]   Now we can go one step further.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.260]   Those were all just ideas to have the basic functionality of the device.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.700]   What about ideas to enhance the functionality?
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.220]   Something like a monopod and a little clip to be able to use the phone for taking high
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.060]   quality stable video or a simple mobile tripod, something like a GorillaPod.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.260]   I have a mobile video kit that I use.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:12.100]   How about something like an external microphone to capture higher quality audio for your videos?
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.100]   Audio makes a big difference.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.540]   Actually more important when you're studying video, content is number one, audio is number
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.580]   two and video quality is number three.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.620]   So you can have the greatest fancy new camera on the iPhone 7, but if you still have the
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.040]   junky microphone and you got a bunch of wind noise, eh, not going to work so well.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.020]   So all of those accessories and the sky's the limit.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.900]   So I won't go into all those different things that you can do, but I'd rather have a $300
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.500]   iPhone 5 if they still sell those, whatever the cheap SE, they're on the SE now, the iPhone
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:47.020]   SE and all of the accessories than a 7 with no accessories.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.060]   I really think that's a better move.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:56.900]   Now you choose the budget, you pick the accessories, but think about that.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   Think about the benefit.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:04.220]   Now let's talk about something where as an example of hurricane preparedness that I just
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.020]   mentioned and I want to mention this again in case you didn't listen to that hurricane
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.060]   show and we'll go on to something like your car next, but a generator.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.580]   I see this and right now there's loads of people, loads of you who are digging out from
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.840]   after Hurricane Matthew.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:22.180]   Some of you, many of you perhaps still without power and you always see this when people
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.340]   are trying to prepare for a hurricane or other type of power outage where they go out and
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:35.480]   buy this expensive generator and maybe one five gallon can of gas.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.860]   Think about what is the functionality that you want when you're buying a generator for
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.220]   power, you need power while the power's out.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:48.260]   Well five gallons of gas will run a generator anywhere from say five to 10 hours perhaps
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.580]   depending on the generator, depending on the load, all that stuff, but it's not a ton of
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.900]   time of power.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:02.420]   If I'm choosing and I've got a $500 budget, instead of buying a $450 generator and a single
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:08.580]   can of gas, I'd rather buy a $150 or $200 Harbor Freight generator and have $300 worth
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:14.700]   of gas and gas cans or other storage mechanisms set by so that the generator can provide several
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.980]   days of power.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.020]   And also importantly, I'd rather lay in the accessories to be able to fix the generator,
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:30.140]   simple tool set, change of oil, better to have a $150 generator and an extra oil filter
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.380]   and an extra quart of oil set by so that after you've run it the appropriate lifespan, you
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.540]   can go ahead and change the oil than the big expensive generator that you run out of gas
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.820]   because you only had one can and you fry if you do get more gas, you fry because you can't
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.280]   change the oil.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.300]   So think about the accessories.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.780]   Talk about vehicles and cars.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.940]   If you buy another car, if you buy a new car, whether it's a new model year car or whether
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.100]   it's a car that's simply new to you but it's an older model year, think about the car that
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.380]   you're buying and what you're trying to get from the car, how you anticipate using it
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.420]   and make sure that you don't spend all of your money on the purchase price of the car.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.940]   If you're going to want accessories for your vehicle, purchase those accessories early
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.180]   so you get the maximum lifespan from them.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:26.180]   Remember, the shorter amount of time that you spend...
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.500]   When you're calculating the cost of something, the way it works is you calculate the price
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:37.700]   that you pay for it, then you're going to sell it at the end of your ownership.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.340]   You calculate what's that sales price that you're going to get for it, how much money
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.340]   you're going to get for it.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.300]   It might be zero if the item completely depreciates or it might be if you buy a car and you buy
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.020]   it for $15,000 and you sell it when it's worth five and you take the difference between those
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.020]   things.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.020]   That's your cost of depreciation.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.900]   If you bought a $15,000 car, you owned it for five years and then you sold it for $5,000,
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:06.660]   that means that that car has cost you $10,000 as measured over that five years or in simple
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.460]   depreciation terms, $2,000 per year.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.260]   That's how you always calculate the price of something.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.460]   If you're buying a phone, what price you pay for it, what price you sell for it, and how
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.740]   long you own it.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.380]   If you're trying to be frugal with your money and trying to make wise decisions, best thing
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.820]   you can always do is stretch out your length of ownership period.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.780]   If you want to make good decisions with a car, you can drive a fancy car.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.420]   If that's important to you, buy a fancy car, maybe even buy a new car, but own it for a
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.300]   really long time.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.100]   Now when you're calculating the value of accessories, and this is why when I got a new phone recently
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.140]   and why I've had this philosophy for years, I want to own those accessories for the maximum
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:50.180]   amount of time possible because that way my per month ownership cost will be the lowest.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.140]   It's silly to say I buy a new pickup truck and for three years I really would like to
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.340]   have a topper on this truck.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.220]   Man, it would be nice to have a topper on the back, but man, that's another $1,500 to
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.780]   get the one that I want.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.740]   Well, maybe someday, maybe someday.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.500]   Then finally after three years I go ahead and get it.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.940]   I get that topper.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.940]   Then two years later I sell the vehicle.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.820]   I'm never going to get the, especially with accessories, you never get the money back
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.540]   for accessories.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.380]   I'm never going to get the money back or at least that much money back for accessories.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:27.700]   Now my cost per month, my usage cost is tremendously high.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.860]   When you're buying a vehicle, if you're going to want to change that vehicle, accessorize
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.660]   that vehicle, have the things that make that vehicle really valuable, plan for that.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.700]   I always chuckle.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.060]   You see these guys that have big mud trucks.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.540]   When I was a kid I was obsessed with big four-wheel drive mud trucks, so I always noticed them.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.080]   Around here in South Florida we have mud, but I don't live in a farming community where
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.220]   these things are actually used.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.580]   They're all show trucks.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.660]   I see these guys have big jacked up pickup trucks with big old mud tires on them, but
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.180]   the tires are completely bald.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   Now those mud tires are expensive and I just think, "Why did you go through all this hassle
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.700]   of buying this big fancy mud truck and jacking the thing up, but you don't have enough money
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.920]   to replace your tires?"
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   This was dumb.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.900]   Not only is it dumb, but it's dangerous because bald tires are extremely dangerous.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.500]   First thing you can do with a vehicle is buy a cheap vehicle and put great tires on it.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   If you have an expensive vehicle and bad tires, you don't get the performance.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.560]   If you have a high performance vehicle out of it, you're going to get the performance
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.000]   out of it because of the tire, all the horsepower that you have has to go through that tiny
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.300]   little patch of rubber on each tire, a few square inches of contact.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.560]   You can have the most powerful engine in the world and if you can't transfer that power
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.300]   to the ground, it does you no good.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.960]   It's not only if you have a performance vehicle, but if you're worried about safety, which
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.000]   you should be.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.500]   One really bad financial move is die in some stupid way.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.340]   Tires are important and good tires make a huge difference.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.980]   You should plan for that.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.760]   Where I live, we get lots of rain.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.000]   Some of you in the upper northeast, you get lots of rain.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It really matters.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Some of you face snow.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.460]   I've never lived in snow country, but from my research, it seems to me that all the data
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:18.820]   and the experts seem to indicate that if you live in snow country, your tire quality makes
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:24.260]   a bigger difference to your vehicle performance than does something like having four-wheel
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.080]   drive.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.060]   Let's say you go and buy a really nice four-wheel drive Subaru because you're concerned about
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.820]   safety, but if by having to spend more money on the Subaru, you don't have enough money
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:40.780]   to get proper snow tires to keep your tires in good condition, you didn't have a good
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.780]   plan.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.540]   If I lived up north, if I had to choose, I'd rather have a cheaper two-wheel drive car
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.220]   and have a complete set of extra snow tires on extra rims so it's really simple to go
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.580]   out on a Saturday morning when it starts to get snowy and just change all four tires real
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.940]   quick without it being a big hassle.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.280]   I'd rather have that than a fancy new four-wheel drive Subaru with bald tires or without the
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.820]   proper snow tires.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.380]   Even for the cost, whatever the modifications are that you want to make, if you want to
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.820]   swap out the tires, if you want to paint the thing something cooler, if you want to add
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.100]   a topper, add a tonneau cover or change out the seats for racing seats or add a stereo
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.340]   system, plan to do that stuff as quickly as possible once you acquire the vehicle.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.700]   Get it installed so you can get the usage of the vehicle over your time of ownership.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.060]   If you've got to reduce your purchase price in order to get that, I think you'll be happier
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.380]   with that.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.260]   Many other consumer items in life are similar.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.620]   If you get a computer, get a proper bag for it.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.900]   If you get a nice new laptop, get a bag that fits it, get the chargers that work.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.620]   Simple thing I've always done that makes a huge difference, have two chargers.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   Again, one charger that stays on my desk at home, one charger that goes with me.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.380]   Those of you who spend all your time and you only have one charger and every single time
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.260]   you wrap up the cord, just buy another charger and that way you don't have to wrap up the
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.260]   cord every time.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.560]   It's really worth it.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.220]   Buy an extra mouse, a mouse that stays on your desk and a mouse that goes with you.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:10.280]   Those things add, they take away the friction of life and they allow you to have more benefit.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.580]   Camera gear is one.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.720]   Photographers know this.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.900]   In photography or videography, the lens that you have and the quality of the lens is at
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.980]   least as important if not more important than the camera body.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.660]   The accessories contribute hugely to the quality of the end product.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.740]   If you're buying a camera and you're a new camera person, buy a cheaper camera body and
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.120]   better lenses.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.100]   You can always upgrade the camera body later on, but the lenses, if you buy quality, you
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.700]   only buy them one time and you get maximum use out of them.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.520]   What about toys like jet skis or ATVs or boats?
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.940]   With boats, save the money and lower the purchase price of the boat so you can buy the proper
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.940]   accessories.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.780]   Buy the safety gear first.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.700]   When you're boating, make sure that you budget for the proper life jackets.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.100]   The best thing you can do on a boat is make sure that you buy those nice inflatable life
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.060]   jackets for you and for all the members of your family or anybody who's boating so that
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.980]   when you're out boating, you can wear those things.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.180]   The things that the Coast Guard wears, the little suspender looking ones or the fishermen,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.540]   the little suspender looking ones that have an automatic inflator.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.220]   If you hit the water, they air up.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.220]   They're not cheap.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:26.500]   They're 75 to 150 bucks a piece, but I'd rather have a little bit cheaper boat and go ahead
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.940]   and have four or five of those so that when I'm out on the boat, everyone on the boat
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.260]   is well cared for and has proper, comfortable life jackets.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.300]   Other safety equipment, make sure that you buy something as simple as an E-Purb, an emergency
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.780]   locating beacon.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.540]   Yeah, it's going to cost you a few hundred bucks, but you never know when things can
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.740]   happen and you'll feel a lot more confident when you're heading out the inlet on your
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.820]   single engine outboard boat if you've got an E-Purb there.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.260]   Big boats, big fancy new boats break down too, and having the ability to have a high
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.140]   quality backup radio so you can call the towboat or having that E-Purb there in the worst case
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.700]   scenario, or having a proper lifeboat on the boat.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.420]   If your boat is of a certain size, make sure you get one of those nice inflatable compact
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.900]   lifeboat systems.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.580]   That safety gear is worth it.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.340]   Now, buy the water toys too.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.060]   Buy the nice cover that covers the whole boat.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.700]   Get yourself the trailer.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.580]   Buy the toys that you need and get them right away so that you can get full use out of them.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.180]   Don't wait and wait and wait and spend all your money on the boat and not have the accessories
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.520]   for it.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.500]   If you don't know what the accessories are, you should probably rent the thing until you
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.140]   figure out what the accessories are and have your shopping list so that when you go to
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.100]   buy, you just buy it all at once.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.300]   Another simple example, if you're going to buy a boat or another toy like that, make
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:47.460]   sure that you have, that you budget for the place to put it away, away from damage.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:53.340]   I can't stand to see people who keep their boat out and sitting in the driveway when
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.580]   for a little bit of money, they could put aside a structure in the side yard or backyard
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   and cover the thing.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.020]   At least install a purchase, a quality custom made cover so you can protect it from the
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.300]   damage of the sun, but better put it, build a little structure because what'll happen
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.020]   is if you build the structure for the boat, here's what you can get.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.100]   You can buy a slightly cheaper boat, but the cheaper boat, because it's well cared for
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:23.340]   and it's not beaten up by the sun and completely destroyed, it'll have a higher resale value.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.740]   Build the structure, buy the cheaper boat, keep that boat for a few years.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.620]   You can turn around and sell it for more, put a little bit of money, then you can go
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.740]   buy the fancy boat.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.340]   But protect the things that you own, protect the things that you want to have.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.260]   Think about the use and do those.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.020]   A couple more examples, guns.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.180]   People buy guns and they're different.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.860]   Talking about the use, depending on the use, depending on the gun that we're talking about,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.020]   you should probably not buy as expensive of a gun as you can afford.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.020]   Number one, let's just say your budget is $2,000.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:04.020]   Pretend that you don't own a gun, you've never owned a gun and you have a $2,000 budget.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.180]   You're better off buying, or a $1,000 budget, let's make it more realistic.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:15.780]   If I had a $1,000 budget for a gun, I would buy a $200 or $300 gun, I'd buy $300 or $400
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.820]   worth of ammo, and I'd buy $300 or $400 worth of training.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.900]   Because when you buy a gun, you don't just need the appliance, you don't just need the
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.300]   tool, you need the ammo that makes the thing work and you need enough ammo that you can
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.620]   actually shoot it so that when you need it, you know how to shoot it, and you need the
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.780]   training that makes that tool more effective, more useful for you.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.260]   Some guns are toys, some guns are tools.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.820]   I think there's a good place for both.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.820]   If you're going to buy a gun, buy a gun where the cost of the ammo doesn't intimidate you.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:56.820]   A simple thing like saying, "Oh, I want to buy a semi-automatic pistol that shoots .45
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.820]   ACP."
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.540]   That stuff is expensive when you're buying 1,000 round cases of it.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   Compare the price of .45 ACP to 9mm.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.300]   I'd rather have a 9mm that I've shot a few thousand rounds through so I actually know
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.180]   how to use than the .45 ACP because that seems impressive to the big macho guy at the gun
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.220]   store.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.140]   Now depending on the application, you need the accessories for it.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.900]   If you're talking about something like a concealed carry gun, you need or probably going to want
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.140]   to buy multiple holsters.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.740]   People forget this and they spend all the money on the gun.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.340]   They don't buy the ammunition, they don't buy the training, and they don't buy the holster
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.460]   so therefore they can't use it.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.420]   But you're going to want to have a variety of different holsters, a shoulder holster
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.540]   for the times when that fits your wardrobe and inside the waistband and outside the waistband,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:50.100]   maybe an ankle holster, a deep concealment holster, depending on what your clothing choice
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.500]   is, what the event is, how you need to do that.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.180]   Remember, the point is to have the gun and to know how to use it, but if you spend all
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.780]   the money on the gun because you bought the fancy one and you didn't buy the holsters
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.420]   that would work with your various clothing choices in different situations, then you
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.740]   don't have it when you need it.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.180]   Things like magazines, having extra magazines.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.980]   Again, depending on the context, there's a difference between buying a hunting rifle
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.280]   where you're going to buy a bolt action scoped hunting rifle versus an AR-15 sporting rifle.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.600]   If you're buying an AR-15, little tip, buying an AR-15, why are you buying the AR-15?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   Think about that.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.120]   If you are just buying it to have around the house, you need to have training and that's
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.520]   where you should focus.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.680]   As far as I'm worried about some intruder and I've chosen an AR-15 as my home defense
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.160]   weapon of choice, fine.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.000]   But buy training so that you're confident with it.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.880]   If you're buying an AR-15 for the end of the world as we know it, the zombie apocalypse,
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:59.440]   don't buy a $2,000 AR-15, buy a $500 AR-15 and $1,500 worth of magazines and bullets.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.640]   Somebody who knows how to have ... I'd rather have a cheap gun, I mean the AR-15 world,
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.480]   I'd rather have a cheap gun and 30 magazines and 3,000 rounds than an expensive gun, three
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.680]   magazines and 300 rounds in that context.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:23.720]   Think about why you're buying something, what's the use that you have for it and plan accordingly
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:30.400]   and don't throw all your money into the initial purchase.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.800]   Another toy, RVs and then we'll get to houses and we're done for today.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.720]   This was supposed to be a short and here we are at 32 minutes.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.840]   RV, if you're going to buy an RV, buy an RV and then accessorize it how you want it.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.940]   Store it properly.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.920]   Make sure that you have the cover for it if you need that, if you're buying a newer one
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.620]   so you get more resale value.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.680]   But the big thing about an RV as an example, save enough money to put gas through it.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:57.520]   If you have a $30,000 budget for camping and RVing, spend $10,000 on the RV and $20,000
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.960]   traveling.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.600]   It's a shame to spend all your money on the vehicle and not have any money to put gas
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.880]   through it and be sitting at home fretting because gas is $3.40 a gallon.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   So plan your budget based upon the use.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.020]   Remember, the point of the RV is to get you out on the road, not to sit in your driveway
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.020]   and impress your neighbors.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.580]   Talk about a house.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.700]   Many people make the mistake of buying flashy, gaudy houses to impress people they don't
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.140]   particularly like because they think that's somehow how they can show their self-worth.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.180]   Consider what the basic functions are that you want from your house and make sure that
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:46.020]   you're either setting aside the money for the accessories and amenities in advance or
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:53.140]   that you're seriously considering the house based upon those accessories and amenities.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:59.860]   The amenities are more important than the size or flashiness of your house.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.540]   Where in your house do you spend the most time?
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.540]   Think about that right now.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.540]   Where?
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:13.020]   In this particular spot in your house, do you spend the most time?
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:19.020]   If you think about it, you should come up with the answer, my bed.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.820]   For some of us, it might be my office.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.300]   I might spend more time in my office since I work in my house than my bed, but most of
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.980]   us, it's our bed.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.740]   You spend seven, six, hopefully at least seven, six, seven, eight, nine hours a day, seven
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:38.420]   days a week, 365 days a year in your bed.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.580]   How much money have you spent on your sleeping experience?
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:52.940]   It's a little tacky and trashy to buy a big, fancy, flashy house and have some cheap thrift
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.340]   store or budget mattress store mattress.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.820]   Not a good use of money.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.980]   Better if you have to choose and have to budget, and we all do.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:09.900]   Better to buy the cheaper house and buy the best bed that you can afford.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.740]   That comfortable sleep and that high quality bed and sleeping experience will be your probably
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.480]   most important valuable accessory of your house.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.300]   Have a junky looking couch, but have a comfortable bed.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.460]   You should own the best, most comfortable bed that you can find that fits within the
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.380]   scale of your budget.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.620]   That bed should be outfitted with comfortable, luxurious sheets or a comforter that is very
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.740]   comfortable for you.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.180]   Other things that affect your sleep, the proper temperature.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:43.180]   Temperature, all the sleep studies, having a proper cool temperature makes a significant
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:47.940]   difference proven on your sleep quality.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.300]   Better to spend a little extra money cranking your AC down a little bit, if you're in the
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:35:00.140]   culture like I am, so you have great sleep than having a fancy looking front door.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.460]   Better if you're going to spend a lot of time in your bed, make your bedroom an attractive
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.700]   place.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.540]   Make it soothing.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.020]   Make it beautiful.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.380]   Make it somewhere that you want to be.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.300]   Your standards are the standard you should follow.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:21.060]   You shouldn't follow the housing magazine, but don't bypass that as a worthwhile investment.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.700]   If you can spend a little bit of money on your housing, don't immediately run out and
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.900]   upgrade your house by buying a new one.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.380]   Perhaps you should just simply go out and upgrade your house by improving your current
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.740]   one.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.300]   Might be a very good use of money.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.300]   Continue that train of thought.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.980]   Figure out where else in your house do you spend the most time.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.040]   Is it in your office?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.420]   Is it sitting in front of your TV?
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.940]   Is it sitting in your reading chair?
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.540]   Buy a high quality reading chair.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.620]   Buy a comfortable desk chair.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   Is it in your kitchen?
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.820]   Well, upgrade the kitchen.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.140]   Make that a beautiful experience.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.440]   Is it your back deck?
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.620]   Make that beautiful.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.140]   You can improve the functionality of the house and get a lot of benefit of it if you start
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.580]   to look at it.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:13.060]   And that's what I mean by focusing on budgeting for the accessories.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:22.380]   I believe it's valuable to develop and practice the habit of frugality.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:28.300]   But frugality does not mean never spending money or always getting the cheapest thing
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.520]   that you can.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:36.180]   Frugality means spending wisely on the areas that are important.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:42.860]   And I think a key part of that is this concept that I've outlined here for you today.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.060]   The next time you're buying a major option, major purchase, whether it's a new gadget,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:54.560]   a new piece of gear, exploring a new hobby, think carefully about the accessories that
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.740]   you want for that hobby.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.500]   Think carefully about how you can put together a complete kit from the beginning and plan
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:10.180]   your budget so that you get full and maximum use of your purchase.
