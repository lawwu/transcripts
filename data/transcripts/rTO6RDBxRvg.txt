[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   Why is my theology not changing my life?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000]   Or at least not changing me as fast as I thought it would.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   Anyone who regularly plunges into the riches of scripture, or who plunges into the riches
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.600]   of the Reformed tradition, will eventually face this very sobering question.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.060]   It's a probing question.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.360]   This topic was taken up by Pastor John and by the late R.C. Sproul at a Ligonier National
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.080]   Conference back in 2011.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.880]   The conversation was on stage there.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.200]   The dialogue turned toward how the mind and the heart relate to the discovery of biblical
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   truth.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   We jump right into the middle of that conversation, beginning here with Pastor John.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Have a listen.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.660]   I totally agree that the primacy of the affections is in terms of the mind serving the affections
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.040]   so that they're not emotionalism, but real fruit of knowing.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.960]   God is not honored by emotions based on falsehood.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.120]   He's only honored by emotions that are rooted in truth.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.560]   Now here's the practical issue.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.280]   Lots of people know things and don't get changed.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.800]   Some of you are just discovering the doctrines of grace and you're just as crabby this year
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.480]   as you were last year.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.240]   So what's wrong?
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.940]   How can you know, right knowing leads to right affections and doing, but not quickly for
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.100]   everybody or not immediately or sometimes not at all.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.420]   The devil knows quite a bit of theology and hates all of it.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.300]   He's maybe more orthodox than most of us, but he can't abide it.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.500]   The reason is because he doesn't know it as glorious.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.780]   He doesn't know it as beautiful.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.260]   I'm just going to add to know something a right is not just to get the theological pieces
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.740]   in order and have the right quotes in the Bible, but to go to 2 Corinthians 3.18, beholding
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.580]   the glory of the Lord, we are being changed from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.060]   Now I would say the implication is that the veil is lifted by the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.900]   This is reformed sovereign grace lifting the blinding veil so that now we don't just see
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.640]   five points.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.540]   We see five stunningly glorious, beautiful things about God and it's the beauty of them
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.240]   that changes.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.600]   Beholding the glory, we are being changed.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100]   They asked me the other day in our little round table at Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.420]   they said, "We're students here and we're faculty here.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.140]   What can we do so that we don't just become academically big headed and get it all right
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.360]   and not be changed or help anybody?"
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.580]   I said, "Most practical thing I can say is as you study from morning till night, pray
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.060]   at least every 10 minutes that God would not let that happen and would reveal the part
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.860]   of scripture that you're working on or the theological issue you're working on, reveal
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.020]   himself to you as beautiful.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.580]   Ask him over and over again, 'Open my eyes that I may behold wonderful things out of
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580]   your law.'"
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.660]   Psalm 119 verse 18, "Open my eyes."
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.300]   I'm staring at it right now, nothing's happening.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.180]   Ask him, "Open my eyes."
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.180]   Because I need to see not just truth, I need to see beautiful truth, glorious truth and
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.140]   that's what changes.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.500]   So prayer I think would be the key.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   You look like you're ready to say something.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.540]   No, I'm just sitting here eating that up, John.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.540]   One place where I have felt so much alone in the ministry that I am involved with is
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.220]   I find so few people who have a passion for beauty.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.220]   And I see that God is the foundation for the good, the true, and the beautiful.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.260]   And you can distinguish among those three things, but you better never separate them.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.700]   And I love it when you sit here and talk about it because you're articulating what I've been
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.500]   trying to articulate for years.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.100]   I've usually said it's not just enough to understand the truth, you've got to see the
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.780]   loveliness of it, and you've got to see the sweetness of it.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.140]   You talk about the glory of it, but you've added to it the beauty of it, and that's it.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.540]   I mean, our worship is supposed to be for beauty and for holiness.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.540]   And God went to such extremes in the Old Testament to communicate that principle of beauty in
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540]   the heart of worship.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.180]   And that's one of the great weaknesses of our tradition is that we seem to think that
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.980]   the only thing that's virtuous is ugliness, and we have to get away from beauty.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:01.700]   But everything that's beautiful, even paintings painted by pagans, travesties, sometimes in
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.320]   spite of themselves, they call attention to the character of God because everything beautiful
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.820]   bears witness to Him because He is the source of beauty.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.980]   And that beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.940]   It's there essentially in the character and the being of God Himself.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.740]   And what you're talking about here just thrills my heart because that's what we have to see,
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.020]   how beautiful, how beautiful the truth is and the God of the truth is.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.740]   I think that the enticement to sin is that sin promises pleasure.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.260]   That's the bad kind of hedonism, but it never delivers.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.740]   It's a lie.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.320]   And that's where our great deception is.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.400]   We think that we can't be happy unless we're sinning.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.480]   And sin can be pleasurable for a season from one perspective, but it can never be joyful
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   ever.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.220]   It can't possibly bring joy because it's not beautiful.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.580]   It's ugly.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.020]   And we have that attraction to ugliness.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.980]   Our basic makeup is to prefer the darkness rather than the light.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.440]   We live in a world that has been marred, seriously marred.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720]   It's been vandalized.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.400]   The beauty of that creation where the glory of God is everywhere, the whole world is full
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.060]   of His glory, but we have vandalized that glory.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.240]   It seems to me that the way Jesus argues is that the kingdom of God is like a man who
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:43.360]   found a treasure hidden in a field, and in his joy, apa khoros, from his joy, he went
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.280]   and sold everything he had and bought that field.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   That's the paradigm for how you get freed from the bondage to the world and sin and
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.820]   the devil.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:02.720]   If you see the kingdom and the king as a treasure more valuable than your grandfather's clock,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.560]   your car, your computer, your books, your fame, and whatever, then it all becomes rubbish
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.340]   and you're freed.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.200]   Before then, it had tremendous power.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.420]   It just held you.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.800]   So sin has the power of pleasure, and the Bible breaks that power with the power of
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.580]   a superior pleasure.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.560]   It severs the root of it.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.940]   Second Peter 1, "All things that pertain to life and godliness are yours through the
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.120]   knowledge of him who called you to his own glory and excellence.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.440]   In order that by these you might have these precious and very great promises and escape
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.080]   from the corruption that is in the world."
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.160]   So how do you escape from the corruptions in the world?
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.560]   Precious and very great promises of the glory and excellence of God.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.380]   The sequence of thought in Second Peter 1, 2, and 3 is escape from corruption comes
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.560]   through a superior promise.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.920]   So I think the beauty of holiness, the more it goes deep and satisfies, really, really
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:18.280]   satisfies the freer you become from pornography and from the pleasures of resentment and bitterness
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   that you want to hold on to, and from fear of man.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.120]   These sins that have their talons in us, those talons are dislodged, not so much by duty
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   yanking them out like this, but by pushing them out.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.040]   You know, who asked, "What's the easiest way to get the sin of air out of a glass?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   Put a vacuum on it?"
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.280]   No, just pour water in the glass.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   It's real simple.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.560]   Just want to get the air out of the glass, just fill it with water.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.600]   That would be the way I want to build holiness into my people's life.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.520]   That's so good.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   Sin has its talons in.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.960]   Yeah, really good reflections here on the heart, on the place of delight and divine
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.640]   beauty and our own maturity into Christlikeness.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.120]   This excerpt was taken from Ligonier's 2011 National Conference in a session titled, "Ministry
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.080]   Reflections with John Piper and R.C.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080]   Sproul."

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I love this one.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.120]   "How can I meaningfully bless my children before bed?"
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.320]   What would it look like if we put some time into this?
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   It's a great question from a dad of three young kids.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.320]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.160]   We'll see you then.
