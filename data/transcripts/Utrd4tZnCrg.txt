[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.520]   We end our week together talking about
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.720]   trials and temptations.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   It's a sobering topic, but one very relevant to each of us
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.480]   at some point, maybe to some of you right now.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.440]   And we start with what we know for sure,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.520]   God tests us, he does.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.320]   That's clear in texts like James 1, verses 3 to 4
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   and 1 Peter 1, 7.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.680]   But then comes the question, does God ever tempt us?
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.520]   James 1, 13 says no, God never tempts us.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.200]   But what really is the difference between being tested
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.480]   and being tempted?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.080]   The sharp Bible question from a listener named Mike.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.600]   Dear Pastor John, in APJ 694, you said that the word
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.440]   for temptation and the word for test
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.800]   are the same word in the Greek, parosmos.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.440]   So how are we to understand the differences in meaning
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.900]   of the two words in passages where it talks about
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.280]   God testing us, James 1, 3 to 4 and 1 Peter 1, 7.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.760]   And then in James 1, 13 where it says that God
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.600]   does not tempt anyone.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.920]   So how do we put those texts together?
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.960]   - Yeah, that is a utterly crucial question.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.840]   We so need to get that clear for God's honor
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.800]   our own peace of mind.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.040]   So let me set the stage as best I can
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040]   so that everybody really can get on board
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.540]   with what the problem really is as Mike
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060]   has presented it here.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.380]   So in 1 Peter 1, verse six, it says,
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.580]   now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.660]   you have been grieved by various trials.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660]   And the word there parosmos in Greek could be translated
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.780]   temptations or testings so that the tested genuineness
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.340]   of your faith more precious than gold
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.260]   that perishes though it is tested by fire
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.880]   may redound to praise and glory and honor
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.900]   at the revelation of Jesus.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.860]   And then similarly in James 1, verse two,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.580]   it says counted all joy brothers when you meet various
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.420]   testings or trials or temptations of various kinds
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140]   for you know that the testing of your faith
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.440]   produces steadfastness and let the steadfastness
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.000]   have its full effect that you may be perfect
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.600]   and complete lacking in nothing.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.580]   And then in verse 12 of that same chapter,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.980]   James 1, he adds this amazing promise
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220]   about the outcome of tested faith.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.400]   He says, blessed is the man who remains steadfast
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   under trial, same word, for when he has stood the test,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.460]   he will receive the crown of life,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.700]   which God has promised to those who love him.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   Now, all these testings are merciful trials
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.200]   from the hand of God in the way he disciplines
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   and purifies and stabilizes and preserves his children.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   We know that Jesus tested his disciples, John 5, 6.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.920]   We know that God tested Abraham, Hebrews 11, 17.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.520]   So we set the stage for this problem first
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.360]   by establishing from first Peter and James
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.320]   that God does indeed test people.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.740]   He does, he tests people and the word there,
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.840]   perosmos or perazzo is the same as the word for tempt.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.160]   There's the problem.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.060]   He puts us through trials.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.980]   Now, the second part of setting the stage
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.200]   for the problem is to observe in the very next verse
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   of James 1 and verse 13, James uses the same word
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.840]   for testing, perazzo mai, and translates it,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   tempt and says, let no one say he is,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.960]   when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   For God cannot be tempted with evil
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.020]   and he himself tempts no one.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.860]   Same word as the word for test.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.360]   So that's the setting of the stage.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.780]   So here's the double problem.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.780]   First, when James says God tempts no one,
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.080]   the word tempt is the very same word in Greek for test
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.760]   and we know God does test people.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.540]   And second, second part of the problem,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.840]   he says that God cannot be tempted
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.960]   and yet we know that Jesus was tempted,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.560]   same word in the gospels in the wilderness,
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.960]   Matthew 4, 1, the Holy Spirit drove him out to be tempted
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.380]   and Jesus is God in the flesh.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.380]   So James expects us to make a distinction
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.340]   in the meaning between the testing that God in fact
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.540]   does bring into our lives righteously
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.580]   and the tempting that God never does,
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.460]   even though he uses the same word for both of them.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.780]   He expects us to make that same distinction
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.060]   in order to show that God is never tempted himself
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   and yet Jesus, who was God, was in some sense tempted.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.120]   Now that's the challenge that Mike sees in these verses
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.760]   and he's asking about and he's right to see them.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.140]   I've seen them for years and wrestled over and over again
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.020]   with how to understand this
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.680]   'cause James is not tripping up here
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.980]   because he knows exactly what he's doing
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.500]   since he puts the two words together
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.980]   back to back in two sentences.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.180]   It's not like he forgot 10 years ago
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.480]   he used the word one way.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   And I think the key to solving both of these problems
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.740]   is found in the next two verses, James 1, 14 and 15
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.100]   and the way James carefully defines temptation.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.180]   It's probably the nearest thing we have
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.980]   to an analysis of the temptation in the Bible
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.980]   where he is talking about our experience of it
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.320]   and how God doesn't experience it
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.760]   and he doesn't perform it.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.160]   So here's what he says in verse 14.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.080]   "Each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.220]   "by his own desire, then desire, when it has conceived,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:52.580]   "gives birth to sin and sin, when it is fully grown,
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.620]   "brings forth death."
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.540]   So there are four steps in this process
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.660]   of what James is calling temptation.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.660]   First, there's desire, which may at first be innocent.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.940]   In fact, I think first, most of them are innocent.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.940]   Second, there is the desire becoming an enticement
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.540]   and an allurement across a line into sinfulness
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.940]   and sinful craving and sinful desire,
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.540]   like the desire of hunger, which is innocent,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.140]   crossing the line into gluttony
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.500]   or the desire of natural sexual appetite,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.100]   which is innocent, crossing the line into lust
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   or the desire of your paycheck,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.100]   like it's not wrong to want to be paged,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.580]   you can pay your bills, crossing the line into greed.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.100]   That's the second step.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.100]   Then third, there's the act of sinning itself
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.140]   in which the sinful desire is put into action.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.340]   And then finally, step four,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.260]   when that pattern of sin goes on without repentance,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.940]   it results in eternal death.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.920]   Now, I think the reason that James says God is not tempted,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.900]   even though Jesus was tempted,
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   is that the innocent desires, like hunger
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:28.340]   or desire for sex or desire for our paycheck,
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.580]   all those innocent desires are the beginnings
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.580]   of being drawn toward what could be a sinful desire
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.880]   of gluttony, lust, greed.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.940]   And in that sense, the awakening of that desire
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.360]   is a kind of temptation,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.840]   but it has not become a full-blown temptation,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.580]   for example, in the life of Jesus, because his hunger,
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.580]   which was an objective allurement toward bread
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.980]   when he was fasting, but it didn't cross the line
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.500]   into an evil desire of rebellion or disobedience
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   or undue craving for what God had told him not to have.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.660]   In fact, none of Jesus' desires in his whole life
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   ever crosses the line into evil desire
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.660]   and therefore never gives birth to sin.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   So we can speak of him being tested or tempted
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.460]   in the sense that he's presented with objective allurements,
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.440]   like bread, when he's hungry,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.300]   so that he experiences hunger or the desire,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.140]   and in that sense, the temptation,
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.140]   but it's never taking him captive by allurements
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.620]   and enticements that cross the line into sinful desires.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:09.820]   And in the same way, I would say God does not tempt
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.560]   because at that point, this is really delicate here,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   so listen carefully, at that point in the human life
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.500]   where we cross the line
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.940]   from experiencing objective allurements,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.060]   they like food, you smell a steak
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.820]   or see an ice cream cone,
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.820]   that point of feeling a legitimate desire,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.380]   when we're lured across the line into sinful desire,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.780]   like the second helping or something
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.860]   the doctor told you you shouldn't have
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.940]   or something that's really part of gluttony or lust,
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.180]   at that point of crossing that line,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   the Bible ordinarily describes God's action
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.420]   as handing us over or giving us up,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.020]   Romans 1:24, verse 26, 28,
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.060]   giving us up to our lusts, giving us up to a debased mind.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.800]   In other words, God is not described
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.180]   as the positive, creative, active agent
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.460]   at the point where our desires become sinful.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.820]   His action is a, as it were,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.580]   if you're gonna involve God by providence here, which I do,
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.620]   his action is a negative action
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.620]   in the sense that he hands us over, he lets us go,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.980]   he gives us up to our sinning at that point.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.700]   So I don't think James is contradicting himself.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.820]   I think he expects us to make a distinction
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.500]   between temptation understood as, on the one hand,
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.180]   as objective allurement, which need not involve sin,
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.620]   and temptation understood, on the other hand,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.620]   as the movement of that allurement across a line
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.060]   so that the desire becomes sinful,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.780]   and the line between desire
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.260]   as a thankful, God-dependent desire
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.260]   and a desire as an assertive, self-indulgent desire
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.940]   is crossed when the temptation happens,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.420]   which he is saying God never experiences
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.020]   and God never performs.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.260]   And if we step back and ask the question,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260]   why the New Testament would use the same word
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.340]   for testing and temptation,
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.100]   perhaps part of the answer is that
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   every test really is a kind of temptation,
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.060]   and every temptation really is a kind of test.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.900]   Our faith in God and our love for God
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.120]   are being tested with every temptation,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.500]   and every test, if we do not act in faith,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.780]   can result in our falling into temptation.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.540]   So when James says, "Blessed is the man
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.620]   "who remains steadfast under trial,
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.160]   "for when he has stood the test,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.740]   "he will receive the crown of life,"
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.620]   that same promise applies
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.060]   to resisting every temptation as well.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.220]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.620]   Yeah, it's a great Bible question.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.860]   Mike, thank you for sending that in,
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.260]   and thank you for joining us today.

[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.660]   Well, next week, we have a question
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.180]   from a listener named Elizabeth.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.180]   She asks, "Why Christ had to suffer in public to redeem us?
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.580]   "Couldn't he have lived a perfect,
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.980]   "law-abiding life in total isolation?"
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.140]   That is a fascinating question,
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.120]   and it's up next time.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.440]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.600]   (upbeat music)
