[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   A listener named Pfeiffer writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, you mentioned in your
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.380]   recent podcast, podcast episode 233, about your trip to the Middle East and the need
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.200]   for young people to devote and give their lives to an unreached people group.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.080]   I'm a young man in college and I'm just wondering what it would look like for a young person
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   like me to move forward on a call like this.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   Where do I start?"
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   That is an absolutely crucial question because my guess is there are a lot of people in churches
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.360]   where not a lot of missions focus exists and therefore there's not a lot of practical help.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.800]   So let me try to give some.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   Where to start if God gives the slightest tug toward the unreached peoples of the world?
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.520]   Start with your Bible and prayer.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.080]   Read your Bible with the question, "What does this have to do with world missions?"
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   And you will be amazed.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.240]   If you just put it all through the grid of missions, then pray earnestly every day, "God,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.560]   please cause your name to be hallowed in my life."
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   That's the Lord's Prayer.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.680]   "Make your name great and treasured and praised and valuable in my life.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.280]   Bring your kingdom through my life.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.500]   Show me the most fruitful path of your will for my life.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.200]   Give me a sense of yieldedness to your leading.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.940]   Prepare me in every way for your service.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.680]   Show me yourself and how I can serve you."
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.520]   So that a young person who's, say, 13 or 15 or 16, if a young person prays that prayer
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.120]   every day, God's going to do amazing things.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.120]   He is.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.840]   He won't neglect a prayer like that coming out of the heart of a young person.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.400]   And then thirdly, be a part of a good gospel preaching, missions-minded church.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760]   Now that may not be easy for a kid because he's going to go where his parents are going
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.120]   and the church may or may not be a missions-powerful church.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.420]   If you're not at one, pray that God will reform your church.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.580]   Be an instrument of reformation among the young people.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.680]   In the history of missions, young people have gotten together to talk and pray about missions
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.520]   and have read things about missions and have become the explosive agents of reform in the
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.140]   church instead of waiting around for the church to get reformed so that they could be inspired
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.280]   about missions.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.320]   Seek to have an older and a younger friend or friends who share your interests and talk
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.880]   to them about missions.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.560]   If you can get to know some missionaries, talk to them, write to them, ask them all
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   your questions.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   Find out who the missionaries are at your church or if you don't have any, find some
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   through friends and write to them and ask them what it's like and give them your very
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720]   particular questions.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   Go to visit them on the mission field.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.160]   Do a short-term missionary project.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.240]   Lots of people wind up in long-term missions because they did a short-term project that
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.180]   missionaries find helpful, not just that you find interesting.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.240]   You want to serve when you go.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   You want to serve.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.320]   You're not there for entertainment and you're not there for a cross-cultural experience.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.920]   You're there to serve and you get all that other stuff thrown in.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   Read missionary biography.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.040]   Read William Carey, A Faithful Witness is the name of the book by Timothy George and
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.280]   there are others.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.760]   Read To the Golden Shore by Courtney Anderson, the biography of Adoniram Judson.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440]   Read John Patton's autobiography.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.960]   Read Peace Child and Lords of the Earth and Eternity in Their Hearts by Dawn Richardson.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.800]   These are books that will just fire your imagination and stir up your faith and your hope and your
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.160]   joy.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.280]   Read Hudson Taylor and his story written by his grandchildren or his own book, Hudson
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.260]   Taylor's Spiritual Secret.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.740]   Read history of missions like Stephen Neal's history of missions or Dana Robert, Christian
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.240]   missions.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.400]   Look at websites like joshuaproject.net and try to understand the scope of the need and
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.480]   the nature of unreached peoples.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   Check out online mission agencies.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.080]   Get to know a few mission agencies.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080]   First start with your own denomination.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.840]   If you're in a church and it has a denomination and they have a world missions board, ask
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.920]   your pastor what it is, how to get in touch with it, if it has a website and just get
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.060]   to know your own denominational mission focus.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.880]   And then outside that, there are lots of interdenominational mission boards and I think it would be great
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.440]   just to scan their websites and read about what God's doing.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   And here's a few of them.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.480]   Pioneers, Frontiers, Wycliffe, TEAM, to every tribe, Action International Ministries, AIM,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.680]   SIM, IMB, WEC, SEND, SEND.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.200]   These are all, you can rewind this podcast and just go online, say type in mission agency
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.340]   in one of those and you can find out all kinds of things that God is doing and maybe be stirred
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.160]   up for a particular place or people.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.320]   And maybe the last thing I'd say is come to the Cross Conference in Louisville.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.380]   This is a conference that I was part of founding and the first one, we got about 3,500 folks
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.380]   signed up.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.840]   So I guess I'm hoping for 4,000 or 5,000 young people, these are students and seniors
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.940]   in high school I think could be included.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.940]   So Louisville, December 27 to 28, you can go online and find thecrosscon.com and be
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.940]   a part of that.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.980]   That is a tremendous encouragement when you're with a whole lot of other students who have
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.520]   the same kind of questions and the same kind of prayers you do.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.340]   So my prayer is that God will make this question that's been asked here, the question of thousands,
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.120]   thousands of young people and that they'll raise them and seek to find all the practical
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.060]   ways that God has of showing them a pathway into missions.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.980]   I pray that God will raise up an army of goers in our day among young people with the gospel
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.980]   of peace.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.980]   Yes.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.980]   Amen.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.340]   And just to reiterate the importance of the Cross Conference, which begins on December
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.740]   27th in Louisville, Kentucky, it's a large conference with several excellent speakers.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.060]   And for more information about everything offered at the conference, check out the website
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.060]   at crosscon.com.

[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.980]   It's spelled C-R-O-S-S-C-O-N.com.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.420]   And we'll be back on Monday asking the question, where did all these Calvinists come from?
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.580]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.340]   Thanks for listening.
