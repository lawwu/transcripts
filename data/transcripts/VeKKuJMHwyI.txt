[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140]   - What are the major forms of vision loss
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.360]   in childhood and in adulthood?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.700]   And what can each and all of us do
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.860]   in order to find out if we have one of these conditions
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.140]   and therefore treat it effectively?
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.540]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.920]   You know, let's start by just reminding ourselves
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.740]   what are the major causes of vision loss?
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.280]   And these are gonna differ where you are in the world,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.100]   but the number one cause of low vision
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.580]   is actually refractive error.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.480]   People who need glasses and especially in other countries,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.080]   affordability, access, can't even get glasses, okay?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.960]   So that's just refractive error,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.140]   but that's fundamentally correctable.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.640]   The next most common cause of vision loss is cataract.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840]   Cataract is the blurring, the aging of the lens
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.720]   inside the eye, behind the cornea.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.080]   We talked about how that is responsible
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.000]   for focusing light under the back of the eye.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.240]   It also has to be clear enough
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   that the light gets through the lens.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.960]   And a cataract is a normal aging process.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.800]   You know, as I said, if we all live to 100
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   or 110 years old, we'll all get cataracts,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960]   we'll all need cataract surgery.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.400]   We actually, as you know, in the eye clinic,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.080]   we see cataracts years or even decades
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.480]   before they're affecting your vision in a meaningful way.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.960]   So the cataracts are forming and that's okay,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.620]   but at some point they get bad enough
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.560]   that it's time to take them out.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.500]   We've actually solved for cataract surgery
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.320]   pretty efficiently.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.500]   We can do a four to eight minute surgery.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.820]   Maybe if we're taking our time,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.040]   it's 10 or 12 minutes of surgical time.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.460]   Take out a cataract.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.220]   It works beautifully 99 point something percent of the time.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.800]   We put a plastic, a clear plastic lens inside the eye,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.400]   exactly where your lens used to be.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.480]   And there's even lenses that can flex
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   or focus light from far and near.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.160]   So cataract is fundamentally a,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.320]   there's still room for improvement,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.960]   but it's fundamentally a solved problem.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.560]   The problem is, is that worldwide,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.780]   there aren't enough cataract surgeons.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.860]   There's not access to care.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.600]   The machinery or the lenses cost too much money
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   in developing countries to get out to the number of people
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.060]   who would need them.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.320]   So it's actually just, again, an access to care.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.200]   Cataract is a reversible, treatable,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960]   easily treatable problem,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.520]   but it's number two on the list of causes of vision loss
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.900]   in the world because we don't have enough access to care.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.280]   We need a lot more sort of programming
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.500]   around global ophthalmology, global eye care
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.460]   to solve for cataract,
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.080]   just to bring that solution to countries around the world.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.200]   Then after that, you start hitting the eye diseases
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.160]   that lead to what are currently irreversible,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.920]   non-reversible causes of vision loss.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.840]   The number one cause of irreversible vision loss
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.600]   in the world is glaucoma.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   So what is glaucoma?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.680]   Glaucoma is actually probably a little cluster
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.120]   or constellation of diseases that we lump together.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.840]   It's a degenerative disease, like a neurodegeneration.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   We talk about neurodegenerations in the brain,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.480]   like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.560]   Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.360]   It happens instead of affecting one or a different area
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.960]   in your brain, it happens to affect the optic nerve
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.480]   that connects the eye to the brain.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.080]   And we need our optic nerves to carry
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.400]   all the visual information from the eye to the brain.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   And so if your optic nerve is degenerating in glaucoma,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.120]   and I should add, there are other optic neuropathies,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.600]   so-called diseases of optic nerve degeneration.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.520]   For example, you can get a stroke of the optic nerve.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.800]   You can have an inflammatory disease
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.920]   like multiple sclerosis called optic neuritis
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   that affects the optic nerve.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.040]   So you can get other optic nerve diseases,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   but glaucoma is by far the most common optic neuropathy.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.480]   And the problem is just like spinal cord injury,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.080]   which is also part of the central nervous system,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.400]   the brain, the spinal cord, the retina, the optic nerve,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.880]   that's the central nervous system,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.960]   and there's no regeneration.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   And that's why spinal cord injury
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   leads to permanent paralysis,
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.040]   while optic nerve injury or optic nerve degeneration,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.000]   unfortunately leads to permanent vision loss.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.640]   So in the case of glaucoma, how do we get ahead of that?
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.840]   Glaucoma has two major risk factors.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600]   One is increasing age.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   There are actually infantile
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.960]   and pediatric glaucomas, unfortunately.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.800]   And those can be much more aggressive,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.920]   much more damaging when they present so early in kids,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.560]   in babies and in children.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.720]   Most of the kind of run-of-the-mill glaucoma
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   usually presents in adulthood and even in the aging adults.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.960]   So much more common after 50 or 60 or 70 years old,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   increasing.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.360]   The other main risk factor for glaucoma
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   is increasing eye pressure.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.280]   The eye actually, you know, it stays inflated.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   It's a balloon, it has to stay inflated.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.800]   We need some amount of eye pressure to keep our eye
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   as an inflated balloon.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.880]   But if the eye pressure goes too high,
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.280]   and we talked about this before,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.680]   you won't even feel it if it slowly gets too high.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.320]   If the eye pressure goes too high, that causes glaucoma.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.440]   And that's one of the things that we talked about,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.080]   you really include in a comprehensive eye exam
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.400]   when you're just getting a screening checkup
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.800]   at your eye care provider,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.040]   at your optometrist or ophthalmologist office.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.360]   They're gonna check your pressure.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   And just as a screening tool,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.600]   check to make sure it's not too high.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.840]   We can treat glaucoma today
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.000]   by trying to reduce the impact of that high pressure
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.120]   by lowering the eye pressure.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.200]   So we have treatments for glaucoma
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.600]   that target the eye pressure.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.120]   We have medications like eye drops.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.080]   We have lasers that can be used inside the eye
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.880]   that can also lower the eye pressure.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.000]   And ultimately, if we need them,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.040]   we also have surgeries that can also provide an outflow
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.360]   that lets the fluid out of the eye in a controlled way
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.600]   so that the eye pressure can be brought back down
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.160]   into normal ranges.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.640]   Again, the reason that glaucoma
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.160]   ends up being the number one cause
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   of irreversible blindness in the world
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   is number one, we can't get those therapies
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.800]   everywhere in the world.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   The affordability of eye drops,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   the access to lasers or surgical procedures around the world
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.920]   isn't equal to what it is here.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.320]   And even within our country,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.400]   people may not be accessing healthcare effectively
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.880]   to get screened for glaucoma
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.920]   or to get treated for glaucoma.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.760]   The other big problem with glaucoma
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.680]   is that it affects our peripheral vision first.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.880]   And only very late in the disease does it pinch in
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.400]   and finally pinch off the center of our vision
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.120]   in typical glaucomas.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.040]   And that's a real problem because we don't notice
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.160]   if our peripheral vision is down.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.600]   You know, our peripheral vision isn't that good
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.560]   to begin with.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.240]   And if you're driving and you can see a pedestrian
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.520]   step off the sidewalk,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.280]   you think your peripheral vision is fine,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.960]   but actually your peripheral vision could already
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.800]   start being damaged by glaucoma
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.920]   and you won't notice it in regular daily life.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.720]   And that's where the importance of screening
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   and early detection really comes in for glaucoma.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.760]   What we don't have for glaucoma,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   we can come back to like kind of what's the cutting edge
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.440]   or the future in these eye diseases.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.640]   What we don't have are treatments that really target
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.600]   the optic nerve degenerative process.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.480]   And we can come back and talk about that.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.000]   So that's glaucoma and optic neuropathies.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.960]   Then the next two major causes
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.320]   of currently largely irreversible vision loss
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.200]   are age-related macular degeneration
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.840]   and then diabetic retinopathy.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.240]   Now age-related macular degeneration is just like it sounds.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.160]   Major risk factor is age.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.040]   It's very common and actually in the developed world,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.480]   you know, countries that are more developed,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.120]   also countries that have a larger Caucasian,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.440]   white population, it's more common in certain populations
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.200]   than in others.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   It actually is, you know, definitely a leading cause
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.520]   of vision loss in the elderly population,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.440]   for example, in the United States.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.720]   And there's two forms of macular degeneration,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.440]   but they both end up targeting the same part,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.120]   the same part of the retina.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.640]   And the part of the retina is really like the rods
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.440]   and the cones that we talked about before.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.120]   The rods do your low light vision at nighttime,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.560]   primarily your cones do color vision and bright light,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.160]   you know, sort of normal lighting that we experience,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.200]   you know, through most of our awake day.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.360]   And in that back of the retina,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.160]   you can have what's called dry macular degeneration,
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.200]   which is a slow, thankfully slow,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   but slow insidious disease that causes the degeneration
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.840]   of the rods and cones and also the support cells
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.480]   that help feed the rods and cones
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.080]   and take care of the rods and cones.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.440]   They're called RPE cells, retinal pigment epithelium.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.800]   It's not really critical, of course,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.560]   the names of every different cell type,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.240]   but these are like the light collecting cells
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   in our eyes in the retina,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.280]   and they degenerate in macular degeneration.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.600]   And in the dry form, there's the slow degeneration,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.240]   but some percent of people with the dry form
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.360]   of macular degeneration will actually convert
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.680]   to what's called the wet form.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.240]   It's called wet because new blood vessels
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.440]   actually grow inappropriately under
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.720]   and even into the retina, and new blood vessels,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.160]   unlike our mature blood vessels, tend to be leaky.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.320]   And so the fluid leaks out of those blood vessels,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.480]   gets into the retina, interferes with vision,
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.560]   and that can lead to a much more acute loss of vision.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   Now, we have some treatments for wet macular degeneration.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.040]   We have injections that can go into the eye
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.160]   that actually fight against the molecules
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.240]   that are causing those new blood vessels to grow.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.720]   And these are antibodies that can be injected into the eye,
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.680]   and they can be very effective
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.000]   controlling patients' wet macular degeneration.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.440]   It's been a much bigger uphill battle,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.080]   even over the last decade as advances are being made
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.480]   to really try to knock back or slow down
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.640]   even the dry form of macular degeneration.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.320]   There was just some exciting news,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.160]   even just in the last few months.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   The first successful trials of a treatment for the dry form
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.000]   have just shown success in properly randomized,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.040]   controlled human clinical trials,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.120]   phase three clinical trials.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.000]   So it's an exciting time.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.840]   Those new treatments are not gonna be a panacea.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.960]   They slow the progression,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.520]   like the anatomic progression of the disease,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.720]   maybe by 20 or 25%.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.840]   And so patients are still gonna get worse
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.200]   even with those treatments.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.560]   So there's still a lot more to be done
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.960]   to really knock back macular degeneration.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.840]   I wanna mention, you mentioned retinitis pigmentosa.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.440]   That's like an inherited form
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.920]   of a type of macular degeneration.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.680]   It's also affecting the rods and cones
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.040]   and also the support cells,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.160]   the RPE cells in the back of the eye.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited form.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   There are actually many different genes you could have
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.200]   that could lead to retinitis pigmentosa.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   In aggregate, if you add up all the people
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.040]   with all those different genes,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.440]   and it can be very devastating
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.000]   'cause it can really affect the vision,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.960]   knock out your vision very early in life,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.000]   including in children
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.840]   and even for versions of that in babies.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.920]   But you add that all up,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.280]   it's still much less common in aggregate
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.520]   than macular degeneration.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.040]   But in a way, it's quite a bit more severe
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.640]   because it does affect people much earlier in life.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.040]   So I sort of clump those together,
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.080]   degeneration of the rods and cones
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.160]   and the support cells, the RPE support cells.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.280]   And then you can't have this part of the discussion
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.360]   about what are the devastating eye diseases
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   without bringing up diabetic retinopathy,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.000]   especially because diabetes,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.480]   unfortunately, really continues to grow in,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.000]   especially, let's say in the United States,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.880]   certainly in the developed world.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.480]   As we, especially type two diabetes with eating habits,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.160]   exercise habits, contributing to a proliferation
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.840]   of some of the risk factors for type two diabetes,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.400]   metabolic syndrome, obesity,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.120]   we're unfortunately seeing a proliferation,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.800]   a growth in the number of people with diabetes.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.720]   And with the growth in diabetes,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.960]   unfortunately comes a growth of the complications
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.800]   of diabetes.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   And one of the major complications of diabetes
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.880]   is damage to the retina inside the eye.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.680]   And we call that diabetic retinopathy.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.400]   And there again, some of the same damage that occurs,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.480]   especially when in diabetes, again,
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.400]   some new blood vessels are growing
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.160]   or blood vessels are leaky.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.920]   Some of that can be treated with,
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.400]   used to be lasers and now more commonly
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   is often being treated with some of the same
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.400]   injectable drugs that are treating macular degeneration.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   But there's still a lot of vision loss with diabetes
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.760]   and diabetic retinopathy.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.440]   I think that's an area where again,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.000]   early screening, making sure if you have diabetes,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.280]   that's an indication where you definitely
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.160]   have to be going in and getting your,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.840]   at least annual exam with an eye care provider
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.520]   or having someone take a photograph
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.360]   of the inside of your eye and rate that photograph
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.920]   to say if you have any diabetic retinopathy or not.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.660]   (upbeat music)
