[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.860]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.700]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.660]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.160]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.600]   Today on the show, we kick off
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200]   as a special April celebration, a tax series.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.500]   This will be a three-part series,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.140]   and today, in part one, I want to give you a case
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.780]   for your moving to a no-income tax state.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.120]   And I want to make sure that I bring this
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   to your attention right now during tax season
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.560]   so that you can have current data to do your own analysis.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.460]   Now, in the United States, April is, of course,
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.660]   the time that we file our federal income tax returns
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.760]   to the U.S. government.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460]   And, of course, most states,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.760]   I don't know of any that doesn't,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300]   but, of course, I've not reviewed every state,
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.640]   but so I think most states line up
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.400]   their own state income taxes
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240]   as being due with the federal returns.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.780]   April is also, interestingly,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.040]   the day that we celebrate Tax Freedom Day
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.440]   in the United States.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.840]   Now, I don't know what the date is for 2019.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.320]   I haven't seen that date released,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.080]   but in 2018, Tax Freedom Day was April 19.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.780]   Tax Freedom Day is the date at which Americans
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.800]   collectively have finished paying all of their taxes.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.020]   In the United States, Americans collectively
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.100]   spend more on taxes than on food,
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.260]   clothing, and housing combined.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.800]   Now, of course, that tax burden is not equal.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.280]   The rich bear it much more than the poor people do,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.440]   but collectively, Americans spend much more on taxes
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.020]   than on food, clothing, and housing combined.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.920]   And so if you actually look at the numbers,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.120]   it takes about 44 days to pay off federal,
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.620]   state, and local individual income taxes.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.020]   Payroll taxes take about 26 days to pay from there.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.820]   Sales and excise taxes, another 15 days.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.920]   Then corporate income taxes, another seven days.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.000]   Property taxes, another 11 days.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.700]   And then the last six days are spent paying
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.440]   estate and inheritance taxes,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.340]   customs duties, and other taxes.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.440]   To bring you to about the middle or end of April
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.540]   for Tax Freedom Day.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.240]   Canadians, of course, celebrate Tax Freedom Day
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.340]   usually in about June.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.520]   Last year, it was June 10.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   Canadians pay about 43.6% of their annual income to taxes.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   So the point is that taxes are a major expense,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.460]   and for many of us, the biggest expense is income tax.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.160]   And that's really frustrating,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   because income tax has that perverse incentive
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.900]   of meaning that if you are productive, you pay more.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.360]   You can avoid many other taxes with your behavior.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.140]   For example, if you don't like sales taxes,
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.860]   you can change how you buy things
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.640]   in order to avoid or reduce sales taxes.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.240]   If you don't like property taxes,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   you can change the property that you buy
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.840]   and where you buy it to avoid those property taxes.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020]   But income taxes are insidious,
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.520]   because in order to avoid them,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.940]   you have to make less money.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.860]   But of course, we wanna be productive.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.660]   We wanna be, we wanna be,
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.460]   I don't know the word to use, productive.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.020]   I wanna be a good steward with my resources,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.860]   with my energy, and with my businesses
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.020]   to produce as much money as possible.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260]   But the more I produce, the more money I pay in tax.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.060]   And I find that very frustrating, personally.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.340]   So, we talk a lot on Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.300]   about how you can reduce your tax bill.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.080]   And I wanna strike right to the heart of it, though,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   because although there are dozens and dozens and dozens,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.620]   perhaps hundreds of individual little techniques
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.540]   that we can put into place in our lives
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.120]   to minimize and reduce our tax bill,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.720]   there are a few big techniques that make a big difference.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.620]   The thing that is difficult for many laypeople
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.660]   about tax planning is they're always looking
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.540]   for one big idea.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.020]   They're wishing for that there were one thing,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.940]   that if you just did this one thing,
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.580]   then it would change your tax situation.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.720]   Well, I've been modestly obsessed with this topic for years
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.860]   and have educated myself to a very high level.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.140]   And I have never been able to find that one thing.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.380]   Try as hard as I've looked to find it.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.560]   But in this series, I'm gonna give you three things
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.960]   that I think are big, fast strokes
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.080]   that'll make a big difference.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.280]   Unlike all the little deductions, all the little offsets,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.200]   all the little credits and things that you can accumulate,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.300]   these are just three big strokes for you to consider.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.100]   So, let's talk about the case for your moving
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.240]   to an income tax-free state.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.700]   In the United States,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.560]   U.S. residents pay income taxes at three levels.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.440]   There are federal income taxes,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.920]   which are charged to you by the U.S. federal government.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.420]   And those federal income taxes apply to all U.S. persons
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.220]   on their worldwide income.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.220]   U.S. persons are defined as all U.S. citizens,
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.920]   any person who actively has a U.S. citizenship,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.600]   no matter where they live in the world,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.020]   and any green card holder or any person
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.320]   who passes the substantial presence test
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.200]   for their presence in the United States.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.080]   So, the U.S. federal government assesses income taxes,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.720]   federal income taxes, to all U.S. persons,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.800]   no matter where in the world they are,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.600]   on all of their worldwide income.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   We'll deal with those another day.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.920]   The second level of taxation is state-level income taxation,
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.040]   which is, if you are the resident of a specific state,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.780]   many states in the United States assess income taxes
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.260]   on some or all of your income
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.120]   if you are a resident of that state.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.560]   So, those are state-level income taxes.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.280]   And then some individual localities, some cities,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.020]   charge an additional level of local-level income taxes,
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.880]   where they will charge you income taxes
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.120]   based upon the city that you live in.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.800]   Now, the percentage of cities that do this
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.640]   in the United States is too small for us to bother with.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.400]   And if you are living in one of those cities,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.500]   you, I'm sure, have specific reasons
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.320]   why you are choosing to bear that tax burden.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.920]   So, I'm not gonna spend any time on your particular problem
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.020]   other than to point out to you
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.620]   that you could move if you wanted to.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.720]   But I do wanna spend some time on state-level income taxes,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.780]   because these state-level income taxes
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.060]   are a significant expense,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.340]   and yet most people don't pay them much attention.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.460]   Let me give you an example of how you should think
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.140]   about your state-level income taxes.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.460]   The first thing that you should do
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.940]   is you should look at your state income tax returns
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.900]   that you are currently preparing,
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.540]   and you should figure out how much you are paying
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.260]   in state-level income taxes.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.200]   Find your exact number, if possible.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.460]   Next, you should estimate how long you think
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.940]   you will be paying that number.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.300]   For most people, this would be,
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.020]   well, until I stop working, until I retire.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.700]   And so, let's use that as a good plug number here,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.160]   but you should calculate your own number
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.020]   based upon your personal plans.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.260]   And then you should extrapolate the number
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.220]   that that is costing you if you simply removed it
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.740]   by moving to a non-income tax state.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.140]   So let me give you an example case.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.940]   Let's assume that we're giving financial planning advice
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.460]   to a 25-year-old, and this 25-year-old
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.340]   is earning a significant level of income,
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.660]   and this 25-year-old expects to pay $5,000 this year
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.180]   in state-level income taxes.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.100]   And for some reason, that state-level income tax burden
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.300]   is going to not change.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.500]   It's going to be a level $5,000 for the next 40 years.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.060]   And the reason, of course, is that it makes for easy math.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.940]   So let's plug this into a financial calculator.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.500]   How much would this particular worker's
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.740]   state income tax bill end up costing them
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.660]   over their lifetime?
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.560]   Well, if we put in a $5,000 annual payment for taxes
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.720]   into our financial calculator,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.900]   we plug in a 40-year number from age 25 to age 65,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.740]   'cause of course, they're going to set up their career
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.960]   in their state, and they're going to have family obligations,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.580]   and they're basically going to stay in that state
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.660]   for a long time, and unfortunately,
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.140]   Americans are not moving as much as they once did.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.980]   So let's just call it 40 years.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.220]   Then let's start with nothing, 'cause of course,
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.860]   there's no money accumulated,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.940]   so let's put in a zero for our present value.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.700]   And let's assume that if this person were to move
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.060]   to a no-income tax state, rather than spend the money,
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.820]   they would save and invest the money,
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.540]   because after all, they're a wise
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.940]   radical personal finance listener.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.300]   They're always thinking about accumulating
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.660]   and building their wealth, so they would invest this money
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.840]   at, let's say, 8%.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.600]   Now, the end of 40 years, how much would that be worth?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.800]   Well, under those considerations,
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   that investment fund would be worth $1,398,905.20.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.880]   So let's call that $1.4 million, among friends.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.560]   $1.4 million is the cost to this particular person's
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.880]   retirement account if they choose to live in a state
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.680]   where they're going to be paying $5,000
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.240]   of state income taxes.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.760]   This is an important thing to point out to people,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.800]   especially young people, before they have
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.380]   established their career.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.620]   If you choose to live in a jurisdiction
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.300]   where you will pay an extra $5,000 per year
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.560]   in state income taxes, when you could move
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.540]   to a jurisdiction that does not impose state income taxes,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.800]   there is a decent chance that you'll be $1.4 million
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.000]   poorer at retirement because you chose
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   to live in that state.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.160]   Now, you run your own numbers.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.080]   For some people, the number will be smaller.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.660]   For some people, the number will be much, much bigger.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.000]   But it's a significant expense that you need
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.600]   to figure out, you need to think about the impact of it.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.480]   If instead of paying that money to your local state,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.240]   you saved and invested that money for your retirement plan,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.800]   it's possible you could have in excess
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.120]   of a million dollars more at retirement age.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.440]   Now, I like to extrapolate numbers even more.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.920]   And I think it's valid to do this
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.000]   because what I have learned working with wealthy people
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.040]   is wealthy people really usually don't ever
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.360]   spend all their money.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.080]   And so I think there's great value in trying
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   to figure out a lifetime cost.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.920]   How much would this cost you if you never spent this money
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.280]   but you just kept this money invested?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.400]   So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna keep
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   the same $1.4 million, specifically $1,398,905.20.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.200]   And now I'm gonna change that to be our present value
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.840]   in our financial calculator.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.380]   And I'm gonna change our time frame from 40 years,
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.300]   which took us from age 25 to 65, to 30 years,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.680]   which is gonna take us from 65 to 95.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.080]   And if you arrive at age 65 and you're alive
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.960]   and you're in modestly good health,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.480]   you could generally expect to use
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.680]   about a 30-year lifespan for your calculations.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.320]   That's why I'm using this 30 years.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.720]   30 years, I'm gonna now make no further contributions
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.560]   to the account.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.840]   I'm just gonna assume that you accumulated
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.760]   this $1.4 million in your account.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.480]   Perhaps this was your annual Roth IRA payment.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.760]   Now at the end of 30 years, how much would that be worth
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   when you die at 95?
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Answer, 14,076,703.06.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200]   So let's call that $14 million.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   This is the cost to your family, to your heirs,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.800]   for your choosing to live in a state
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   that imposes $5,000 of state-level income taxes on you.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.600]   This is the cost, $14 million of foregone wealth.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.640]   What you have done is, instead of accumulating that wealth
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.320]   and transferring it to your children,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.840]   transferring it to worthy people, worthy causes,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   worthy organizations that you support at your death,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and making an impact on the level of $14 million,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.360]   you are choosing to transfer instead
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   the value of that money to your state government.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.840]   Now, is that a good thing for you to do?
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   That's up to you.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.120]   It's a free country, it's a free world.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.400]   You get to choose.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.000]   You choose to live in that state,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.080]   or you could choose to live in another state.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.840]   You can assess how worthy your state government is
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.040]   of the stewardship of that money.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.440]   Are they doing what you think should be done with it?
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.240]   If so, more power to you.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.480]   If they're not doing what you think
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.800]   should be done with it, however, consider moving.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.160]   You should consider moving.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.720]   If there were a list of causes that I would like to support
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.480]   that I believe have a high impact
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.240]   with very few problems associated with them,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.160]   this is on that list.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.680]   See, I have certain constraints that I use
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.160]   in assessing ideas, and for example,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   I'm always looking for peaceful solutions.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.320]   You'll never hear me advocate
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.480]   for any kind of violence or violent action.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.400]   I'm always looking for peaceful solutions
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.980]   that make change in the world.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.240]   I'm also always looking for voluntary solutions,
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.280]   things that individuals can do
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.640]   that are peaceful and voluntary
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.440]   that will make change in the world.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.800]   So you'll never hear me advocating
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.400]   for something that is coercive,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.640]   where the threat of violence
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   is being imposed on another person.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.240]   You'll also hear me looking for things that are effective.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.800]   And I could go down my list, I'll skip that.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.840]   And I'll just simply point out
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.400]   that this particular suggestion,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.160]   that you consider moving to a state
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.700]   that doesn't have state-level income taxes, is powerful.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.040]   It is far more powerful if you care about your money.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.120]   It is far more powerful for you to figure out
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.000]   how to remove $5,000 of unnecessary income taxes
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.640]   than it is for you to waste time
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.820]   figuring out how to save $4 a week on a cup of coffee.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:03.520]   Why should you go through dozens and dozens
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.040]   of little savings techniques, little savings tips,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.400]   to figure out how to save $5,000
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.000]   when you could just simply move?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.700]   Now, I don't think it's either/or,
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.040]   that would be a false dichotomy.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.840]   I recommend it's both/and,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.120]   save on income taxes and save on those other things as well.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.960]   But the point is, start with the big things, just move.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.480]   And if you wanna make an impact to your state,
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.960]   if you wanna send a message,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.920]   the only message that you can send in the modern world
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.760]   is simply removing yourself from their tax rolls.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.280]   See, voting is a waste of time, doesn't really do much.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.600]   Politicians don't really listen to votes,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.280]   but they do listen to money.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.180]   And by removing your money, you can make a statement.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.840]   That's the end of my political commentary,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.960]   but if you study this, you will see
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.920]   that all over the United States,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.800]   there is a steady flow of people
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.920]   from high-income tax jurisdictions
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.480]   to lower-income tax jurisdictions.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.840]   And that finally, that is making state-level politicians
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.120]   wake up and pay attention.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.440]   So if you'd like to be part of that change,
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   I would encourage you to consider this.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.320]   It's peaceful, it's voluntary,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.200]   you're not harming another person,
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.620]   you're not coercing anybody else, it's entirely legal,
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.920]   you're just simply making a different choice.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.880]   Now, before you move,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.340]   let me give you a little bit of additional advice.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.820]   You need to look at your actual numbers.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.160]   You need to look at your actual cost
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.560]   of being in that particular place.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.840]   If your number is $500 a year,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.140]   there's probably less of a motivation for you to move
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.000]   to a no-income tax state,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.640]   especially if that low-income tax state
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.120]   might come with higher cost of living in other areas.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.480]   For example, you need to consider all your taxes.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.160]   You need to consider your employment taxes,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.800]   but those won't change based upon a state level.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.840]   You need to consider your federal income taxes,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.440]   but those won't change based upon a state level.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   You need to consider your state income taxes,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   but you also wanna consider things like real estate taxes
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.440]   or sales taxes, because depending
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.140]   on what your circumstances are,
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.120]   those taxes might be a bigger deal for you,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.820]   and so you might choose to be in a place
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.580]   that has higher state income taxes
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.380]   because you don't earn that much,
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.300]   but in a place that has lower real estate taxes
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.380]   'cause what you actually do is manage a lot of property.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.700]   So look at your actual circumstances
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.860]   'cause you need to consider all of those costs.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.520]   But then also look at what's available to you
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.500]   and consider what your alternative use of the dollar is,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.380]   your opportunity cost.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.420]   For some people, removing state income taxes
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.020]   can allow them to spend more money
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.660]   on things that are important to them.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.020]   For example, let's say that you have been trying
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.460]   to figure out how do I pay
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.960]   for my children's educational costs?
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.540]   Well, if I just freed up $5,000 for you,
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.040]   maybe that'll get you started.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.780]   For some people, this is such a huge number
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.380]   that you can pay off your house.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.860]   The most, the best example that I've ever heard of this
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.700]   was years ago when I read Tony Robbins' book,
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.100]   "Money Master the Game," he spent a couple pages
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.820]   laying out how after being a lifelong California resident,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.300]   he finally a few years ago had enough
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.860]   when he was paying 60, if memory is right,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:20.700]   63% of his income in total tax burden.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.700]   And he finally said, "That's ridiculous."
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.380]   And he decided to move out of California,
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.220]   move somewhere else.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.580]   He wound up buying an oceanfront estate
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.580]   in Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.340]   Beautiful, brand new house, oceanfront estate,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.900]   one of the lots on Palm Beach
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.220]   that goes from the water to the water.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.740]   And he said that he paid off the entire house
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.300]   with his income tax savings in a mere six years
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.860]   by moving from California to Florida.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.060]   Now, your scale may be bigger than Tony Robbins' scale.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.140]   Your scale may be smaller than Tony Robbins' scale,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.460]   but you can still find something useful
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.700]   to spend your money on that's probably gonna do you
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.020]   more good than sending it to the state government.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.620]   Now, obviously also,
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.500]   you need to consider your personal considerations,
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.020]   your personal ties to a place.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   I can indeed come up with a number of very relevant arguments
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.740]   that would be perfectly applicable
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.020]   as to why you would stay in a state
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.300]   that charges state-level income taxes.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.020]   The obvious ones have to do with your income.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.980]   If you don't make a lot of money, chances are,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.140]   you should stay in a state
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.980]   that doesn't have a lot of state income taxes.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.860]   So if you don't make a lot of money,
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.580]   you would probably be well-served
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.240]   by thinking about moving to a state
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.480]   that charges a lot of state-level income taxes,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.780]   but also has a lot of welfare programs.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.020]   That would probably serve you well.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.300]   There might be also the obvious one of your income.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.540]   Perhaps by living in a state
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.500]   that imposes a high level of state income taxes,
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.420]   you might have access to a job market
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.740]   that is simply not available in another place.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.280]   There is a reason why many people today
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.060]   feel that it's worth the expense
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.100]   for them to live and work in downtown New York City,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.620]   where they are paying federal income taxes,
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.900]   New York state income taxes, and New York City income taxes,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.860]   because that's where their job is,
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.920]   and they don't feel they can relocate.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.420]   That should be obvious to you.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.940]   But for the percentage of people
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.260]   that just assume that to be the case,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.580]   and they say, "Well, I have to live here to work,"
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.700]   I don't know what percentage actually has
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.020]   to live there to do that job.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.380]   I don't know, you'd have to analyze it.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.600]   In some industries, the answer would be a lot.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.980]   But for every one of those people,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.200]   I think there's at least one or probably five others
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.940]   that could actually move to another jurisdiction,
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.580]   and could do much, much better.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.100]   Especially in today's world,
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.780]   there are a lot of places you can go.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.300]   You can do high-tech work in places
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.860]   other than Silicon Valley.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.060]   You can do financial work in places
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.620]   other than New York City.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.180]   It's something I've watched a lot happen in Florida,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.700]   where there have been major changes in the financial sector,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.520]   and it's just growing.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.760]   And one of the big reasons is,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.660]   why should we spend all our time in New York City,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.540]   when we can be in the same time zone,
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.800]   an hour and a half, two and a half hour flight,
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.420]   away from New York City, when we need to get there,
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.380]   and save massive amounts of income taxes?
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.380]   And so there's been a big growth
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.980]   in the financial sector in Florida.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.740]   And with the communications revolution,
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.380]   where live video conferencing is so much easier to do
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.060]   than it once was, it's considered accepted, et cetera,
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.900]   this is changing more and more,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.740]   and it's putting pressure on New York.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.220]   Now, the financial industry, obviously,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.100]   New York City still has a major hold there,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.500]   and I don't expect that to change anytime soon,
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.340]   but there are options for you to at least consider.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.900]   You shouldn't just think about this in terms of money.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.300]   You obviously need to think about it
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.580]   in terms of the total lifestyle package.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.740]   What do you get by living in certain other places?
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.860]   But you should calculate the cost.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.700]   So calculate it.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.940]   How much does your state income tax cost you?
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.540]   How much will it cost you if you save that money
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.300]   and invest it until your retirement age?
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.380]   And how much will it cost you
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.620]   if you just simply save that money
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.440]   and leave it behind as your estate?
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.860]   Not everyone should move,
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:26.740]   but everybody should calculate what they can gain by moving.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.580]   And then once you've calculated it in the coming years,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.620]   hey, you might as well look around.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.020]   And while you're looking around,
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.780]   perhaps you're thinking about getting a new job
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.980]   in a few years,
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.940]   maybe you should prioritize looking for a job
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.700]   in a state that doesn't have state income taxes.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.540]   Whether you choose to move or not, that's up to you.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.900]   But at the very least, if you're negotiating a new job,
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.980]   perhaps you bring this into the equation.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.700]   If you've got a job offer in Florida,
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.900]   and you've got a job offer in New York City,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   perhaps you take the one in New York City,
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.480]   but tell the employer, you gotta increase my salary
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.380]   'cause I've got this job offer in Florida,
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.700]   and I don't have to pay New York State
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.340]   and New York City income taxes.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.300]   So use that data in your own planning
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.180]   to help you get better results.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.340]   What states can you move to?
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.900]   Well, here are the states that don't require income tax
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.740]   from their residents.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.060]   There are seven of them that simply flat out
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.820]   don't have state-level income taxes,
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.380]   and those seven states are Alaska, Florida,
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.580]   Again, the seven states that don't have any income tax
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.580]   are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:54.420]   Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.560]   Now, there are also two states
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.860]   that deserve honorable mention.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.940]   New Hampshire and Tennessee aren't strictly free
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.760]   of income taxes, but they only collect
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.020]   very minimal income taxes.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.600]   I think New Hampshire taxes interest and dividend income
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.700]   if it's in excess of $2,400 for individual singles
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.180]   or $4,800 for joint filers.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.820]   Tennessee doesn't tax wages or a salary,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.720]   but they do collect on interest income
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.260]   from bonds, notes, and stock dividends
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.260]   if that interest income exceeds $1,250 for singles
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.040]   or $2,500 for joint filers.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.940]   Now, these states still have large governments,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.020]   and so they do still collect income.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.520]   They still do have tax revenue
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.180]   that supports the state government,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.140]   but it'll come from somewhere else.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.660]   For example, in Wyoming, it's heavily focused
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.260]   on energy taxes, on the oil business.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.380]   In Nevada, of course, it's gambling and hotel taxes.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.980]   Texas and Florida have their own interesting, unique things.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.540]   Alaska has oil revenue.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.300]   So the states still function, and they require,
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.860]   they collect their taxes in other ways,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.100]   but they don't collect income taxes.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.540]   Now, here's what's neat about that list of nine states.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.300]   Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.020]   Texas, Washington, Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Tennessee.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.460]   In those states, you could find
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.840]   almost any environment that you like.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.420]   For example, you want big cities?
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.380]   There's plenty of big cities in those states.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.860]   Want cosmopolitan lifestyle?
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.300]   Plenty of cosmopolitan lifestyle available.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.620]   You'd like to live out in the country in the sticks?
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.700]   You can do that in those states.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.740]   Want a big mansion?
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.820]   You can do it in those states.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.260]   Want just an average neighborhood?
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.780]   You can do it in those states.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.460]   If you want the desert, you can find it.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.300]   Want the beach?
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.120]   You can find it.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.960]   Want mountains?
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.860]   You can find them.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.700]   Planes?
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.060]   They're available.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.940]   So in those states, you can find
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.940]   almost anything that you want.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.260]   It's hard for me to think of something
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.920]   that is available in another state in the United States
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.680]   that's not available in one of those nine states,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.440]   except the tax question.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.900]   So think it through and be willing to consider it.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.620]   Here's the other cool thing about those states.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.160]   You can find a situation, a living situation,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.300]   in those states that could be fairly convenient
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.980]   to your current stomping grounds.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.220]   Now, Alaska may not be the most convenient,
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.380]   but between Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.860]   Texas, Washington, Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Tennessee,
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.580]   you can find a state that's pretty geographically close
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.020]   to most other places in the United States.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.940]   It's not that far from Washington to Oregon.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.420]   So if you've got family in Oregon
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.920]   and you wanna live in Washington,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.220]   that's not that difficult to do.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.740]   A few hours will get you there.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.540]   It's not that far from Wyoming to Colorado.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.340]   Not that far on an airplane from Florida to New York.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.740]   Not that far from Nevada to California.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.080]   So why not consider just simply moving
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.620]   and then spend some time in those states?
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.060]   Don't spend enough time there to trigger your tax residence.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.780]   Make sure that you don't do that,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.500]   but you can still spend some time there.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.580]   And in many businesses, as long as you have moved,
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.300]   you may not even necessarily have to change your business.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.440]   Now, some states you do
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.220]   because of the actual way that the laws work.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.180]   If you just think that you're going to,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.140]   I've thought about doing a whole course on this.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.500]   I don't think it's gonna affect enough people,
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.020]   but just leave it simply enough
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.540]   that you may even be able to keep your business.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.000]   You just need to change your residence.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.740]   Now, study carefully.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.780]   Make sure that you learn,
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.840]   if you're moving from New York to Texas,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.100]   or if you're moving from California to Nevada,
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.660]   make sure that you study carefully
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   and you understand how you can adjust your affairs
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.720]   to make sure that you fully
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.920]   get rid of your resident classification.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.200]   There are a lot of things you can do.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.880]   And you wanna make sure that you minimize your footprint
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.820]   in any of those states that impose income taxes.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.480]   You never wanna become a tax resident of those states,
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.620]   but it's very, very doable.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.320]   It's very, very possible.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   And here is my last suggestion for you.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.120]   One of the big things that has changed in 2017, 2018
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   is the deductibility of state-level income taxes.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.280]   Those of you who are paying
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.360]   state-level income taxes this year
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   are now appreciating the enhanced cost of that.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.980]   But what you should recognize is many times
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.200]   the cost of moving may still allow you
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   to have expenses that are deductible.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.360]   For example, mortgage interest is still deductible
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.640]   without the same restrictions,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.560]   although there were slight changes,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.600]   but without the same restrictions
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.840]   as state-level income taxes are now under.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.000]   So if you moved from the California side in Lake Tahoe
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.920]   to the Nevada side in Lake Tahoe,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.480]   and you had to pay a higher price
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.640]   because of the higher value of those properties in Nevada
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.960]   due to the no state income tax,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.760]   that higher price may now be deductible for you
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.720]   where your California taxes no longer are.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.280]   Or other examples, sometimes the cost of traveling
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.760]   is a deductible business expense.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.160]   So let's say that you move from New York to Florida
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.200]   or to New Hampshire or to Tennessee,
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.160]   but now you're required once a quarter
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.720]   to fly up to the city for a week.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.760]   Well, recognize that now,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   as long as that travel is appropriate business expense
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.020]   and you're flying for business,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.200]   if you work from Florida
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.980]   and you have to travel up to New York City once a quarter
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.080]   and spend a couple of weeks there,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.460]   whereas previously your New York-level income taxes
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.860]   were deductible but now aren't
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.740]   after the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act,
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.460]   your business expenses will be deductible.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.420]   And since you probably already have family in New York
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.560]   and you probably enjoy visiting that family,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.220]   there's no reason why you are required
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.900]   to not enjoy visiting your family
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.540]   while you are doing business in New York.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.840]   And what's more interesting
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.620]   is this could provide an interesting way
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.980]   for you to do a tax-free transfer of wealth.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.700]   For example, let's say that you are currently
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.400]   a New York resident, but you've decided
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.480]   that you don't wanna pay New York state income taxes anymore
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   but you still are gonna have some business connections
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.720]   in New York and you look at the laws of New York
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.220]   and you recognize that you may have to go up there
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.040]   to see clients, but if you adjust,
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.080]   I'm not gonna get into the details
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.700]   of how your corporate structure, et cetera,
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.760]   but you're gonna move your business
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.600]   out of New York to Florida.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.560]   But now that you're a Florida resident
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.040]   and you are doing business in Florida,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.840]   you're still gonna have to go to New York to see clients.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.280]   When I was a financial advisor, I had clients in New York.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.040]   If I needed to go to New York and see clients,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   it was every bit as deductible,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.440]   or business expense, for me to fly from New York,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.480]   from Florida to New York to see clients
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   as it would have been for me to travel
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.680]   from New York City to New Jersey to see that client,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.400]   or you get the point.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.680]   Now, if you properly schedule your appointments
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.720]   using the common rules of business deductions,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.160]   for example, you have business appointments on Friday
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.260]   and you have business appointments on Monday,
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.960]   now all of your travel to New York
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.640]   is a deductible travel expense.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.000]   And the fact that you spend the weekend
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.140]   with your parents on Long Island doesn't matter.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.200]   Your time in New York is deductible travel days.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.720]   What's more interesting is perhaps instead of renting
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.260]   a hotel in downtown New York City,
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.720]   you rather work out a rental arrangement with your parents
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.880]   and you rent a spare bedroom in their home
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.000]   for you to stay in when you're there on business travel.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.840]   So yes, you have to commute in from Long Island,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.600]   but now you can pay your parents
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.420]   whatever an appropriate rate is
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.880]   for the rental of that home,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.580]   check the Airbnb, get some comparable rental expenses,
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.000]   et cetera, but perhaps that you can rent it
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.400]   and perhaps you find that based upon the comparable rentals
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.120]   in that area, your rates are now $100,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.320]   New York, I don't know what they are, $200 per night.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.640]   And so you wind up coming up to your parents' house
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.080]   once per quarter and you rent from your parents
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.040]   a room for $200 per night.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.480]   And you're there for a total of four nights
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.120]   because you come Friday through Monday.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.460]   So now you have four nights,
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.840]   that transfers $800 into your parents' pocket.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.320]   And any person in the United States
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   can rent out their house for up to 14 days per year
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.960]   and not classify their house as a residence
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.120]   and not have to pay income tax on that money.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.840]   You of course don't get to deduct any rental expenses,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.160]   but you can of course,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.720]   but you get to keep the money tax-free.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.000]   So what have we done if you do this?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.600]   Let's say that you fly up to your parents
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.560]   and you rent that bedroom from your parents
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.440]   when you are in town on business
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.480]   and you have appropriate business meetings.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   You happen to stay over the weekend,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.380]   but you schedule appropriate business meetings
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.760]   on Thursday, on Friday, on Monday,
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.000]   or if you are there over a holiday weekend,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.040]   perhaps Monday is the 4th of July,
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.640]   you make sure that you have appropriate business meetings
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.800]   on Friday and on Tuesday.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.040]   And you spend a long weekend there
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.880]   and you pay your parents a rental rate
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.180]   for the rental of that home.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.960]   Well, you could do that up to 14 days per year.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.400]   Your parents will receive all of that income
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.600]   completely tax-free legally
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.000]   because they're not renting out their house
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.420]   for more than 14 days per year.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.520]   You of course, as an individual with a company,
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.900]   will be able to deduct that rental expense
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.380]   as a proper business expense,
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.960]   travel expenses for you doing business,
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.560]   and we've effectively accomplished
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.360]   a nice tax-free transfer of wealth.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.040]   You say, well Joshua, a room in my parents' house
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.960]   is not sufficient.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.980]   What if I actually need a house?
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.360]   Perhaps I need a very nice,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.160]   I live in New York and I need a house
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.400]   to entertain clients in,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.200]   and if I move from New York to Florida,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.760]   I'm not gonna be able to entertain clients,
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.960]   or I'm not gonna have a place
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.180]   for us to have our annual shareholders meeting, et cetera.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.860]   Well, there's no reason why you only have to rent a room
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.280]   in your parents' house.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.980]   You can rent the actual house,
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.220]   and perhaps your parents have a beautiful house,
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.980]   beautiful condo right in the city,
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.100]   and for your purposes,
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.300]   you're gonna be entertaining clients,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.000]   you're going to be having shareholders meetings,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.760]   or something like that.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.020]   For your purposes, you need a full apartment.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.860]   Go ahead and rent the full apartment.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.400]   And the market rate in New York City
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.720]   is most likely $1,000 a night.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.560]   I don't know.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.980]   You can figure out what your comparable rates are,
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.540]   so you can figure out what they should be charging.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.500]   Of course, if they're gonna be renting a house
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.540]   to your business,
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.460]   then they need to make sure
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.220]   that they're charging a fair market rate.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.740]   It can't be an inside deal.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.240]   But whatever the comparable rate is, $1,000,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   they rent it to you,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.040]   you rent it for 10 nights per year.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.560]   When you're in town using that house for entertainment,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.260]   you pay them $10,000 out of your business.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.700]   That is fully deductible.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.860]   You've had what you needed in New York,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.320]   which was a place to do business temporarily,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.180]   and your parents have tax-free income,
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.020]   and you live in Florida and remove your state income tax.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.620]   So don't miss the fact that, yes,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.020]   you might have to travel more back to the state
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.040]   where you have state-level income taxes.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.100]   But as long as you don't trigger tax residency
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.620]   by your activities,
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.020]   you can still travel there just because you move.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.380]   And those of you who are looking for ways
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.600]   to figure out how do I change my affairs,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.100]   now that I'm in a situation
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.220]   where I can't deduct all my state income taxes now,
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.020]   there are plenty of options available to you, plenty.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.300]   By the way, just because you move your residency
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.380]   doesn't mean that you can't keep your own house
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.740]   in that place and keep it as a rental apartment.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.340]   So residency is not the same thing
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.480]   as owning rental property.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.980]   Now, it may or may not be a wise idea for you.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.760]   I just simply want to point out to you
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.100]   that if you do that and you have rental property
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.580]   in a place that you want to go,
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.340]   now you have an even stronger case
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.980]   for additional travel to that area.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.700]   So consider keeping the house that you currently live in,
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.460]   rent it out as rental property,
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.540]   move to a state that doesn't have state income taxes.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.300]   And if you need to travel back and forth to visit family,
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.860]   I would imagine that you could figure out
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.140]   how to coordinate your affairs
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.020]   so that you can come back and check on your rental property.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.540]   There's no reason why you can't spend the week
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.820]   before Christmas working on your rental property
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.940]   or checking up on your managers, et cetera.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.660]   Just figure out how to arrange your affairs in such a way
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.860]   that you are not a resident of that state
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.100]   paying unnecessary levels of state income taxes.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.780]   You cannot legally or legitimately stay
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.820]   in the state that causes income taxes
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.560]   and just move your residence elsewhere
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.780]   with some kind of paper sham.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.220]   It's not possible.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.540]   There are a number of court cases, however,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.420]   of people who have done this,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.700]   and there are some things that you can look at
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.260]   as to what actually constitutes a residency.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.040]   Where are you actually a resident?
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.020]   You don't have to have a huge house in Florida.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.300]   You just need a house in Florida.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.640]   House doesn't even have to be bought.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.060]   Has to be your house, though.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.900]   Where's your stuff?
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.740]   Where's your dog?
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.740]   Where are your doctor's appointments?
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.500]   What church are you involved in, et cetera?
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.100]   It's a whole bunch of factors
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   that makes up where your residency is.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.400]   But recognize that you are choosing to live in a state
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.540]   that imposes state-level income taxes.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.260]   And if you are a productive person,
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.260]   a productive person who is generating lots of income
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.960]   and doesn't want additional drag on their income,
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.300]   you should seriously consider moving to a state
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.600]   that doesn't impose state-level income taxes,
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.220]   because it very well could result
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.140]   in millions of dollars available for you in retirement
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.300]   and potentially tens of millions of dollars
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.820]   for your children and other heirs.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.780]   Consider it.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.100]   That's the case for your moving to a no-income tax state.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.460]   As we close this show,
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.820]   just remember this is part one of three,
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.800]   and I'm gonna give you two more cases
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.260]   in the next couple of episodes.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.180]   But for today, I just wanna quickly plug,
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.480]   I recently very quietly released on my website,
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.180]   I very quietly re-released my career and income guide.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.340]   And I wrote that course.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.420]   It was one that had a very good reception.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.080]   Bunch of students went through it.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.440]   And really had, I've got a bunch of testimonials
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.880]   from my students of new jobs that they've got,
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.680]   ways that they've increased their income.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   But it's my contention that one of the most important areas
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.760]   of financial planning for you to begin with is income.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.840]   If you get income right,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.880]   and specifically here's what that means,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.680]   you are working in work that is well-suited to you
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.920]   based upon your personal criteria,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.960]   and you have massive financial potential
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.880]   available to you in that work,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.840]   almost everything else falls into line.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.880]   Just think about how easy it is to become wealthy
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.640]   when you earn $40,000 a year,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.440]   versus how easy it is to become wealthy
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.860]   when you earn $400,000 per year.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.840]   Almost no matter what you do,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.880]   you're gonna become wealthier earning $400,000 a year
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.520]   than $40,000 per year.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.960]   It's so much easier to live well now,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.440]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   and to be on a plan for financial freedom
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.600]   in 10 years or less,
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   when you make $400,000 a year
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.940]   than it is when you make $40,000 a year.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.840]   So why should we spend all of our time
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.160]   sitting around thinking about how to make it
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.320]   on a $40,000 income,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.720]   when you, if you're earning $40,000,
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.120]   could make a plan in the next 10 years
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.140]   to go from 40 to 400?
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.960]   Dumber people than you have done it.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.260]   Dumber people than you are doing it.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.200]   So why not you?
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.840]   But the question is, if you're gonna do that,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.120]   you would actually need to understand how to do it.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.080]   And nowhere in your formal schooling
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.620]   did you ever have a class on how to do it.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.640]   Nowhere in 11th grade did they sit down and say,
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   "Hey, everybody, today let's talk about
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.580]   "how to increase your income by 1,000%
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.980]   "in the next 10 years.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.220]   "We're gonna teach you how to go from $15 an hour
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.520]   "to $1,500 an hour."
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.880]   No one taught you that, eh?
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.960]   Don't you think that that would be a pretty decent course
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.800]   to take in college?
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.520]   After all, if college is supposed to be
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.280]   a enhancement for your career,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.400]   don't you think it would be useful
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.000]   to learn how to make some money?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.600]   Fortunately or unfortunately, it's not taught in college.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.440]   'Cause the point of college
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.140]   has never been about making money.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.780]   You have to learn it yourself.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.740]   So I would recommend to you
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.320]   that if you have not spent this last year
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.780]   at least a few dozen hours sitting down
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.420]   and thinking about how you can build a career
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.200]   that is appropriate for you,
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.720]   a career that you will love doing
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.580]   so that you'll never want to retire,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.620]   and a career that has massive income potential,
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.460]   I'd encourage you to come by
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.000]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.120]   and give my course a shot.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.640]   It's called The Radical Personal Finance Guide
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.240]   to Career and Income Planning.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.080]   I'll give you one more last bit of teaser.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.640]   Just imagine this for a moment.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.000]   Imagine how wealthy you would be
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.600]   if you work in a career that you love,
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.500]   that has huge earning opportunity,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.160]   that is perfectly suited to your life and your lifestyle,
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.200]   that you never want to quit,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:07.240]   such that you never actually have to retire.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.500]   Now, if you want to be mega wealthy,
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.480]   I think you should consider that.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.300]   Because if you take high income
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.740]   and pair it with low expenses,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.940]   recognize that, well, the point is
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.060]   you don't have to spend as much as you make.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.820]   So just because you make a million dollars a year
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.120]   doesn't mean you have to spend a million, too.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.860]   And all of the good stuff comes
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.760]   when you have a high income.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.680]   Now, if you hate your job and you make a high income,
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.220]   I'll be the first that'll stand up and say,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.580]   hey, consider going to a job that you enjoy more.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.860]   But there's no reason to choose between those things.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.540]   In 2019, you don't have to choose
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.640]   between work that you love
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.660]   and work that pays a lot.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.000]   You don't have to choose.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.660]   There are so many options available to you
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.580]   that in time, you can find and develop a career
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.760]   that is well-suited to you
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.660]   that has massive income potential.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.540]   So stop for a moment and imagine this.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.980]   Imagine yourself with an income
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.280]   that is five to 10 times higher than it is today,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.040]   whatever your number is right now.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.480]   Imagine yourself with an income
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.120]   that is five to 10 times higher today than it is today.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.100]   And imagine yourself earning that income
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.660]   in a way that you never wanna stop.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:27.360]   So now, instead of stopping your income at 65,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.520]   you can keep your income until 95
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.060]   and invest the whole way along.
