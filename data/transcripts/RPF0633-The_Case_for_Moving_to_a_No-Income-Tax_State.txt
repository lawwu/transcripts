[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.940]   much more than the poor people do, but collectively Americans spend much more on taxes than on food, clothing, and housing combined.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.560]   And so if you actually look at the numbers, it takes about 44 days to pay off federal, state, and local individual income taxes.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.760]   Payroll taxes take about 26 days to pay from there. Sales and excise taxes another 15 days.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.960]   Then corporate income taxes another 7 days. Property taxes another 11 days.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   And then the last 6 days are spent paying estate and inheritance taxes, customs duties,

To bring you to about the middle or end of April for Tax Freedom Day. Canadians of course celebrate Tax Freedom Day usually in about June. Last year it was June 10. Canadians paid about 43.6% of their annual income to taxes. So the point is that taxes are a major expense and for many of us the biggest expense is income tax. That's really frustrating because income tax has that perverse incentive of meaning that if you are productive you pay more

Perhaps I need a very nice, I live in New York, and I need a house to entertain clients in, and if I move from New York to Florida, I'm not going to be able to entertain clients, or I'm not going to have a place for us to have our annual shareholders meeting, et cetera." Well, there's no reason why you only have to rent a room in your parents' house. You can rent the actual house. And perhaps your parents have a beautiful house, beautiful condo right in the city, and for your purposes, you're going to
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:23.920]   a full apartment.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   Go ahead and rent a full apartment.

[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.020]   Now, may or may not be a wise idea for you, I simply want to point out to you that if you do that and you have rental property in a place that you want to go, now you have an even stronger case for additional travel to that area. So consider keeping the house that you currently live in. Rent it out as rental property. Move to a state that doesn't have state income taxes. And if you need to travel back and forth to visit family, I would imagine that you could do that.
