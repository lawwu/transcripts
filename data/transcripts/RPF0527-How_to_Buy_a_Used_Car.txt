[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   I am your host.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.040]   I am your fellow financial freedom fighter, working with you as you create and build your
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.680]   plan for financial freedom.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.760]   Today I want to tackle the subject of buying a car, specifically buying a used car.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.520]   On yesterday's show, I engaged in a form of satire, perhaps a bit of hyperbole.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.760]   I created a show that I hope struck at your emotions.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.060]   My intent was to trigger you into thinking, just through the use of something that I hoped
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.720]   would be entertaining and provocative and yet demonstrate some useful tactics and techniques.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.160]   But today I want to be a little bit more analytical and a little bit more of a teacher, build
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.680]   not with hyperbole but with just systematic thinking.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.160]   Sarah in the Facebook group wrote in and asks, "Tips for buying a used car.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   I'm a graduate student.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.560]   Luckily, I've been able to work and study, so I have no loans and debts or debts.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.000]   However, I don't own a car.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.640]   I'm planning to move once I graduate and I might need to purchase a car then.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   I want to get a used car, but I don't want to buy something that ends up falling apart
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   shortly afterwards.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.720]   I plan to pay in cash."
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.140]   I know this is a broad question, but do you have some input?
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.140]   What should I keep in mind?
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.600]   Are there good places or websites for me to look at for cars or good resources I should
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.280]   check out, et cetera?
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.360]   That question came in from Sarah and I'll also reference another question that came
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   in in the Facebook group about a listener who recently had a car that was totaled and
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.700]   they're in a situation of – well, let me read you the details because I will integrate
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700]   these too.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.480]   "I'm seeking vehicle advice for someone who has totaled their car and is averse to
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   car debt.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   Me.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   The question is do I purchase a vehicle for about $7,000 for myself to keep going as I
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   have been or splurge on a family vehicle for my wife and two small children, i.e. a minivan.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.520]   The story is I totaled my 2009 Mazda 3 last week and will be getting $6,200 from my insurance
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   payout.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.080]   I have a $12,000 emergency fund, no debt besides the house.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880]   If I utilize my emergency fund to pay out on some other YNAB categories that are long-term
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.840]   savings goals for home improvements, I could pay cash for a vehicle of around $17,000 out
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   the door.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   It's a scary thought.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.960]   My money though, not the bank's, right?"
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.200]   Anyway, her car is a 2006 Hyundai Tucson with 110,000 miles and good condition that I hope
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.440]   to own for five more years.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.640]   Within two years, we'd like to have a third child which would require a third row for
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.400]   my wife's car, etc.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   So I'll talk through these two examples and give you some advice.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.520]   Let's start with used car versus new.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.880]   I'm not opposed to buying new cars.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.400]   I think you can actually make a very strong argument under certain constraints for buying
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   a new car.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.840]   The first simple and clear argument would be if you have the money and you're rich and
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.720]   you want to buy a new car, okay.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   That's fine.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   Go buy a new car.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.400]   Who am I to tell you what to do with your money?
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   You don't answer to me.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.000]   I just want to help you think about it and make an intelligent decision.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.120]   But of course, I know that you're here listening saying, "Well, is buying a new car an intelligent
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   decision?"
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.040]   And I would say it can be.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   It can be.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200]   There are times at which if you'll buy a new car, you can get a great deal.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.920]   Sometimes if it's a new technology or a factory is offering some special rebates or incentives,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.680]   you can purchase a new car and because of the heavy discounting, get a great deal.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.200]   Number of years ago, Nissan was selling Nissan Leafs and they weren't selling well and so
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.560]   they brought out this very big rebate program.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.040]   I thought it was a great deal.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.880]   When I calculated the numbers, there were good rebates.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.560]   By buying a new car, you were able to get good government tax credits on that purchase.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   It was a well-built car that had good results.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.040]   Because it was a new technology, it wasn't really available in the used market.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.920]   It was a substantial savings because of buying an electric car instead of a gas car.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.120]   I thought it was a good deal.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.040]   It was a good example of a car to buy new.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.920]   Sometimes you'll see this in terms of a lease deal even.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.640]   A few years ago, I watched the lease deals on the smart car, so-called smart car that
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.080]   was in the market.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.680]   They were offering these crazy cheap lease deals.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   For somebody who wanted to use one, I had a friend of mine who was a real estate agent.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.920]   They leased one.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.180]   They wrapped it nicely.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.360]   It was a great showpiece for their business.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.160]   I thought it was a good deal.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.880]   From time to time, you'll find these inefficiencies in the marketplace.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   I alluded in yesterday's show with regard to a pickup truck.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.580]   I alluded to something like a Toyota pickup truck.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.920]   If you had the money and you were looking to buy a newer pickup truck, something like
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   a Toyota Tacoma especially, if you don't do the math, the used market for the Toyota
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.720]   Tacoma pickup truck, one that's a few years old, two, three years old, it's so close
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.980]   to the new market.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.720]   It really is hard to make the argument that you save much money buying in the used market.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.740]   Buying in the new market can be a good idea.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.040]   New cars are easy to finance.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.240]   If you're going to use some form of financing, I think in general you should avoid that,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.160]   but there are times in which – my hyperbole yesterday notwithstanding about only idiots
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.920]   finance vehicles – there are times in which you may choose to finance a vehicle.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:18.640]   I am deeply opposed to that with the exception of some kind of – let me rephrase that.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   I try not to make absolute statements, but it's very hard for me to use financing.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   I can understand if you can arrange it.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.480]   There are ways to make a deal.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.160]   If you're the kind of person who has iron discipline on your money and you say, "Okay,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.480]   this car is going to cost me $30,000.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.640]   I'm going to put this $30,000 over here in the CD ladder and I've got this great
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.340]   deal, this 0% financing," I can concede that.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.000]   Most people overspend because of using financing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.520]   That's what most people do.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.560]   If you're not most people, if you have the iron discipline to walk into a car dealership
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.400]   and not go from the cheap model to the fancier model just because it's only an extra $20
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   – go for it.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.680]   I don't think I have that discipline.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   So I'm opposed to financing, but it's not like it's a moral argument.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.680]   I'm not saying that it's always wrong.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.520]   I'm saying that the effect of financing where you're taking a large amount of money
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   and you're turning it into a stream of payments can be very harmful because you wind up buying
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   more.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.760]   Anytime you can put something on payments, you wind up buying more than need.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.120]   Also, if you're buying new cars, you have all those problems.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.000]   So 97% of the time, I'm opposed to financing for vehicles.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.020]   But these are some arguments in which new cars can be helpful.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.760]   Perhaps you are looking for a technology that's just not available in the other marketplace
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.240]   or you're shopping for something like an electric car.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.560]   That's a good current example.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.040]   Perhaps the needs that you have, you need a large four-wheel drive SUV.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.240]   Well in that case – and you live in the bush – you might need to buy a new Toyota
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.600]   Troopy and that might be what you need to do and they just aren't out there in the
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.680]   used market as you would like.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.920]   There are times in which the new is really compelling.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.120]   I think there are times in which if you can commit to owning a vehicle for a long time,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.400]   you can make the new car – find the case for a new car financially.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.460]   Somebody commented in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group and shared a picture
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.680]   of their new Honda Ridgeline pickup truck that they had purchased recently.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.760]   This was the second version or the second model that Honda recently redesigned it.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.800]   This person had saved for it for years and they paid cash for it.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.240]   That's a great pickup truck.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   If you can make a thoughtful, intelligent decision and buy a kind of vehicle that you
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.080]   know you're going to keep for a long time and then you can own it straight from the
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.320]   factory so you can ensure that all of the proper servicing is done right from the beginning
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   – I know guys that go and buy a new Honda or a Toyota, immediately swap out all the
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.460]   fluids for the best synthetic fluids and they drive it carefully.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.320]   They make sure that their maintenance schedules are followed to the T.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.120]   You can take your vehicle ownership period and push it out to maybe 20 years and have
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.360]   trouble-free ownership.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.420]   The longer you can own that vehicle, the better.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:21.260]   So there are good arguments for buying a new car but that's not what most people do.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.120]   Most people just buy a new car because it's convenient, because they want the new car
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.200]   smell, because it's easy to finance a new car.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.320]   So they wind up wandering into the Kia dealership and buying a cheap new Kia and ruining their
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.920]   financial life.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.760]   Somebody like Sarah who's riding in as a graduate student, frequently a non-thinking
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.480]   person would just say, "Well, I'm going to go and finance a new Kia," and they buy
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.800]   a car that is certainly a decent vehicle in terms of it's well-made.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.520]   It's got a 10-year warranty, et cetera.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.640]   But you're buying a cheap car that's an Econobox that probably doesn't have the
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   level of comfort that you'd want to have for a long-time ownership.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.320]   I don't enjoy driving Econoboxes on the interstate at 75 miles an hour and frequently
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.200]   that chafing of this not being a great car but an adequate car will result in the person
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.800]   three, four years in going ahead and saying, "I'll just trade this in and move up."
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.000]   So I think that there are better ways.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.260]   In general, I think you want to look for used cars while you are building your wealth.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.160]   One last comment.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.600]   There is an argument also that could be made for new cars, especially if the vehicle itself
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.960]   will be financially productive for you, i.e. you run a business.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.800]   Sometimes just the simple reality of getting a vehicle and then buying it new, buying it
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.480]   as part of a fleet, ordering it exactly how you need it because of the equipment that
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.760]   you're going to run on it, or being able to order it and immediately have it wrapped,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.160]   or being able to order it and in the business you're in, the particular newness of the
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.400]   vehicle matters and it's helpful to you, or being able to order it, have it serviced
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.640]   by the factory and have a service contract smooths things out.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.980]   If you're making money with a vehicle, downtime is a very bad thing and so you've got to account
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.980]   for that.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:24.000]   And so it may be worth it for you to pay in depreciation rather than to pay in downtime.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.680]   There's no guarantees on any of these things but I am encouraging you to think carefully.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.000]   Now for most of us who may work a job and who are still seeking to build wealth, I think
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.320]   you're well advised to steer clear of the new car marketplace.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.240]   I do wonder if I would have made that recommendation 30 or 40 years ago.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   Frequently people talk about, "Oh, buying a used car, you're buying somebody else's
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   problems."
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.320]   In 1970 that may have been true.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.600]   It may have been.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.280]   I'm not sure of it but it may have been true.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.680]   But today in 2018 as I record this, man, vehicles are made so well.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.040]   You just don't see vehicles broken down the way that you once saw them.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   Vehicles are made so much better.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.120]   I don't get this like hating of technology.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:24.680]   For most applications, an electric car is a superior technology to a gasoline car.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.160]   Don't hate the electric car technology.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.880]   Just calculate if it's right for you.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:36.240]   A vehicle that runs with fuel injection is a superior vehicle design, is a superior engine
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.480]   design to a vehicle that runs with a carburetor.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.320]   No you can't adjust the fuel injection system when you're out on the boonies like you can
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.680]   with a carburetor.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.200]   But the fuel injection system is very unlikely to leave you on the side of the road like
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.960]   the carburetor was.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.440]   There's this weird hatred of modern technologies that so many people have.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   New cars are great.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.040]   I mean you've got so many new car makers.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.320]   Even I may criticize Kia.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.480]   I've owned a Kia, Hyundai, but I've owned a Hyundai and had no problem with it.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.000]   But I may criticize them.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.880]   But man, they're wonderful cars.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.680]   They come with a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.240]   That's amazing.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.600]   So cars are made so well today.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.560]   I really think and I have good evidence for this as far as objective research evidence.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:31.360]   The minimum life cycle for just any normal car that's cared for, not abused, and that
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   has the basic maintenance done should be about 200,000 miles.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360]   Really should be.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.840]   And it's not uncommon for a vehicle to be able to go for longer.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   So back to Sarah.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.920]   I would encourage Sarah to buy a used car.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.640]   But to shop carefully.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.840]   Let's talk about how to shop.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.880]   First you need to know what you need.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.720]   And one of the biggest things to consider is what kind of vehicle will suit my needs
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.800]   for the longest period of time.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.720]   One of the problems that people make when buying cars is they don't exercise a lot
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.840]   of forethought.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   I remember this a number of years ago watching somebody.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   They bought a convertible.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   Newly married.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   They were hoping to have children.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.040]   And they bought a two-seat convertible.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.120]   I thought, "Why did you do that?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.440]   Did you not ever think about strapping a car seat into a two-seat car?
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.160]   It just doesn't work.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.800]   It destroys your back."
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.840]   And yes, sure enough, a few years later they wound up selling the convertible.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.120]   And it was a poor, cheap convertible that didn't get a lot on the marketplace.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.160]   It was a soft top which got destroyed and it was just a dumb decision.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.680]   So if you can just do something – if you're willing to be practical and do something as
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.720]   simple as buy a four-door car instead of a two-door car, that car will last you longer.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.480]   And this is a big deal because the buying and selling costs on a large ticket item like
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.680]   a car are substantial.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.160]   In Florida, we have sales tax.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.200]   Every time you buy a car, you're going to incur a 6% sales tax or a 7%.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.440]   You're going to incur a significant sales tax.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.680]   There's new registration fees.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.080]   There are new costs of doing the shopping, the time.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.760]   And so the longer you can – if you can choose something that is going to work for you for
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.400]   longer, that's better.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.380]   Does that mean that you always get the biggest vehicle possible?
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.380]   You have two children.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.880]   Does that mean you automatically go for a 15-passenger van because you might have more
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   children and outgrow a seven-passenger minivan?
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.180]   No, I don't think so because there would be other costs associated with that.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.160]   But for Sarah, I would encourage Sarah to at least consider purchasing something that
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.560]   would be a four-door car at the very least.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.080]   Now, I love minivans and I love minivans even for single people.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.960]   And here's where you have to consider your personal circumstances.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.240]   Knowing nothing about Sarah other than her comment here saying that she's been in grad
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.220]   school, I would still think a minivan is a wonderful vehicle for her to buy.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.520]   For the full version, go and listen to episode 356 of the show called Your Next Car Should
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.500]   Be a Minivan, Here's Why.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.540]   But for somebody who's a graduate student, there's a good chance that a graduate student
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.400]   would be – after they graduate, would be looking for a job.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.800]   In that early phase of a career, there'd probably be quite a bit of movement.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.000]   Well, minivan would be a wonderful car for a young woman to own.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.280]   It's very practical.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.040]   It's very, very safe.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.420]   Minivans basically all get five-star crash – modern ones all get five-star crash ratings
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.560]   on every one.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.840]   They're one of the most safe vehicles you can drive.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.440]   They're safer than SUVs in terms of on-the-road manners because they have a lower center of
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   gravity.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.200]   They avoid some of the inherent characteristics of an SUV or larger van that make them unstable
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   on the highway at high-speed maneuvers.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.840]   Minivans are wonderfully safe.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.400]   They're wonderfully practical.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.040]   A young woman who is building her career – I have no indication of her being married – a
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.400]   young single woman, it'd be a wonderful vehicle because she could use it if she needed
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   to move.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.120]   She could easily downsize her things into that vehicle.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.080]   She needs to change cities to go to a job.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.600]   She can avoid expensive movers.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.360]   She could get everything she needs into a minivan.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.840]   If she needed to use it for travel, she would have a comfortable place where she could travel
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   with her friends.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.720]   It would be a wonderful vehicle.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.280]   So that would be a great road to go.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.080]   Minivans are very, very popular.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.400]   There are tons of them out there.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.740]   More on that in just a moment.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.200]   But at the very least, I would encourage Sarah to purchase something that would be a four-door
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   sedan or a minivan.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.200]   Now if Sarah were living in downtown New York City or downtown Miami, now that advice might
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.400]   change because now there might be a need for or a benefit from a smaller car that's easier
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.480]   to park, that's easier to park on the streets.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.680]   That would all depend on what her long-term plans are and what her lifestyle is.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:53.060]   So think about it and do your best to look forward perhaps a decade and plan on a 10-year
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.620]   car ownership lifecycle.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.880]   Even if you bought new cars but you just thought in terms of a 10-year lifecycle instead of
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.500]   a 5-year lifecycle, you would come out financially significantly ahead.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.100]   So I would encourage Sarah, think about what type of vehicle would fill your needs.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:21.240]   For most people, the practical, reasonable answer to the question is a four-door sedan
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.660]   or a minivan.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.440]   You may have other purposes.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.380]   If you need to tow a trailer, if you need a smaller vehicle, you adjust accordingly.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.380]   But for most people, a four-door vehicle will give them years of usage or a minivan.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.700]   It would give them years of usage.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.420]   Consider for something that's fuel-efficient, of course, but calculate the math.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.060]   I love the Toyota Prius.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.020]   If I were just going to tell Sarah, "Here's one car you should buy, buy a Toyota Prius.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.300]   It's a wonderful vehicle.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.900]   It's a wonderful vehicle."
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:01.740]   But for somebody who doesn't drive a lot, the excess – the better fuel mileage doesn't
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.080]   make that big of a difference.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.060]   So how much are you driving?
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:13.980]   Calculate all those costs and try to understand what type of vehicle would be effective for
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980]   you.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.740]   Number two, calculate how much money you have.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.380]   And here would be my constraints.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.420]   First, no debt.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.340]   No car debt, no debt.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.840]   Pay cash.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.100]   In order to pay cash, you'll have to have savings.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:38.820]   If you only have $1,000 or a couple thousand dollars, you can find a vehicle for $1,000
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.540]   or a couple thousand dollars.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:46.660]   I do think at those prices, you're starting to get where you better become a skilled shopper
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.320]   and/or you better plan to upgrade.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   But it's entirely possible to buy a quality vehicle that is inexpensive.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.300]   For quite a while, I had a Toyota Corolla that I had purchased.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.460]   It was a 1998 Toyota Corolla.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:11.100]   I bought it from an elderly lady who was selling it because she was no longer able to operate
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.500]   the manual clutch.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.380]   I had always kept my eyes out for such a car.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:23.160]   I always wanted to have just an extra cheap car with very few things to break.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.820]   This was the most basic model in existence.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.040]   This was a four-cylinder engine with a manual transmission.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.820]   Nothing on the vehicle was power and it had just basically been driven around in a normal
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820]   usage scenario.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.060]   It had about 120,000 miles on it.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.680]   A vehicle like that has very few things to break.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.900]   I paid $500 for it.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.980]   I kept it for a while.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.820]   I drove it for quite a while.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.820]   Drove great.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.820]   It's comfortable for me.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.820]   I enjoyed it.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.820]   Got me down the road.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.140]   Wound up selling it for $1,000.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   I replaced the radio.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.220]   I think I paid $30, put a new radio in it, $40, something like that.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.540]   Other than that and other than changing the oil, I didn't spend one dime on the car other
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.540]   than gas.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.580]   Gas, change the oil a couple times, put a new radio in it for $30 so that would have
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.040]   a Bluetooth connection so my phone would work.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.120]   That was it.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.980]   That car is still going fine.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.780]   It could still go for another – for years and years because it fundamentally has not
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.620]   a lot of things to break.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.140]   Now, it's got its own problems.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.540]   It doesn't look fancy.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.620]   It's not – it's perfectly comfortable to drive long distances.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.580]   I've driven it – I drove it across the state of Florida a couple times.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.220]   It was cheap to drive.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.940]   It didn't have a cruise control but I could have installed one if I wanted one of those.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940]   It didn't look great.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.180]   If I needed to present a certain image, that wouldn't be a great vehicle to drive.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   But you could do it.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.980]   That was a $500 car.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.020]   I think in general, you probably should get – go a little bit more upmarket to get something
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.060]   that's a little bit more comfortable for the longer time.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.420]   But a few thousand dollars, you can find wonderful cars for a few thousand dollars.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.960]   And so here's how I think you should establish your budget.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.540]   Your first establishment should be how much money do you have?
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.220]   Don't go into debt, especially for somebody like Sarah, a young woman getting out of graduate
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.740]   school, building her career.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.260]   Don't go into debt.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.280]   If you go into debt, now you start to get locked into a situation.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.480]   If you don't have any debt and let's say Sarah gets a job that winds up being unhelpful
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.100]   for her, it doesn't work, she has bad coworkers, she has an abusive boss.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.640]   If she's in debt, she's going to be tempted to stick it out for longer than she should.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   She has no debt.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   She says, "That's it.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   I'm out of here."
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.320]   She loads up her stuff in her minivan, drives to another city, gets another job.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   Simple.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   If you have debt, it's not simple.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.380]   It's harder.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.120]   So no debt, however much money you have.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.480]   But number two, if you have a lot of money saved, I think you should, especially in the
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.680]   early years of your life cycle, your wealth building, you should keep your car purchases
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.640]   as low as possible, somewhere between 10% of your annual income and 50% of your annual
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.260]   income, depending on how hardcore you are and depending on the marketplace.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:15.060]   You can't always follow that rule, that arbitrary rule, and get what you need.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.360]   For example, I recently shared how I now own a diesel pickup truck.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.240]   I have a specific need case that I've voluntarily committed to.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.280]   It's not something that I've chosen for a diesel pickup truck.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.040]   Well, that makes it harder to buy a $2,000 vehicle.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.920]   If I didn't need that diesel pickup truck to achieve my goals, then I could have bought
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   a $2,000 vehicle.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:47.300]   If you're hardcore, at 10% of your annual income, you can find something great.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:53.000]   If you have an annual income of $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, we're talking about a car of $3,000,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.400]   $4,000, $5,000, all day long, I can go to any city in the country, in the United States.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.960]   I don't know the context in other countries, but any city in the United States, and if
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.240]   I have a little bit of time, could find a quality vehicle in that $3,000 to $5,000 price
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.600]   range.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.720]   Now there are times in which it would make sense for you to increase that.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.600]   Let's go back to Ben's question where he talked about a minivan.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.800]   Ben says that I have two young children and we're hoping to have a third child in the
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   coming years.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.200]   So we're considering purchasing a minivan.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.160]   In this case, Ben has no debt.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.560]   He has an insurance payment.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   He has savings.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.000]   In this case, I would consider saying, "Let's go a little bit higher than the 10% in order
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.400]   to have an ideal life cycle."
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.640]   If Ben bought a $3,000 minivan, he might be putting himself in a situation where that
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.280]   minivan would start to get long in the tooth after four or five years when he still would
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.800]   have a lot of value of that minivan.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.680]   But if Ben were to purchase a – let's say a $10,000 to $12,000 minivan with cash,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.960]   that was – I don't know what his income is but let's just say that were 30% of his
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.160]   income.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.280]   Now he would have a vehicle that could last for a decade easily and would comfortably
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   accommodate his family and would be very reliable, very new, very fancy, little things that would
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   probably make his wife happy like having the electric doors.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.520]   That's really nice for a mom to have the electric doors.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:30.120]   Little things like having a nice systems built into the vehicle, whatever those things are.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.160]   Those would make his life really nice and I think he would find value of going up a
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.900]   little bit in price so that he could have a longer term of ownership versus following
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.840]   some arbitrary rule of 10% in order to keep it as cheap as possible.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.980]   As long as the total value of your vehicles doesn't go north of half of your annual
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.800]   income.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.600]   So if your annual income is $50,000 per year for your household, you should never own cars,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.440]   motorcycles, RVs, snowmobiles, jet skis, boats.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:07.040]   You shouldn't own toys and depreciating assets or if we want to use Kiyosaki's term,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.960]   depreciating liabilities.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.240]   Just toys that go down in value of more than half your income.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.080]   Otherwise, you wind up I think putting yourself in a situation where it's hard to get wealthy.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.760]   You become vehicle rich and money poor.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.960]   So 10 to 50% of your annual income.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.120]   I encourage lower but sometimes you got to go up market a little bit to get something
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.680]   that's really going to last for you.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.120]   So set your budget.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:40.320]   The next thing to consider is what brand and what models are you interested in.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:47.120]   Make sure there is good data that you can consult and whenever you have good data, study
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.680]   the data.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.400]   If you'll just study the data on so many things in life and try to align yourself with
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:59.200]   whatever constraints are there with the data, it's a little easier to get good results.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:06.140]   For cars, study the reliability data and buy something that is reliable.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.720]   If you want to make it simple, buy a Toyota.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:17.800]   Toyota has over the last decade and a couple of decades earned for itself a world-class
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.520]   reputation for reliability.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   That reputation has been won the hard way.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.240]   It's not a false reputation.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:34.580]   It's a real reputation and Toyota very well deserves to be the highest ranked most popular
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.880]   vehicle brand in the world.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.120]   I think that's worth your considering.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.000]   If you can't buy a Toyota, buy a Honda.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.520]   Honda also has done a great job with reliability.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.640]   Now what's interesting, your best resource here is Consumer Reports.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.520]   What's interesting is there are other brands and other models that can be very reliable
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:03.380]   but it's harder to find that more sure thing with other brands and other models.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.520]   If you were going to buy a pickup truck, a medium-duty or heavy-duty pickup truck, of
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:15.360]   course, you wouldn't necessarily automatically go right to a Honda.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.400]   If you wanted a light-duty pickup truck like the Ridgeline, you would go with a Honda.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.920]   Toyota has their Tundra.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   That's their biggest one that they do.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.400]   But if you needed a bigger one, of course, they're not going to offer it.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.480]   Well, now you get into a situation where you can say what model is very reliable.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.080]   The Ford F-150 is a very reliable vehicle.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.980]   The Chevrolet Silverado is a very reliable vehicle.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.820]   You may find that a BMW 5 Series is a very reliable vehicle.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.780]   But for a new car buyer like Sarah, I would just say look for a Toyota.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.620]   Makes it very, very simple.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.720]   You may or may not get lucky with some other model and if you have another model you're
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.780]   happy with, that's fine.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.500]   But I personally would just put my bet on buying a Toyota.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.180]   I wouldn't buy a Mazda.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.380]   I just buy a Toyota.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.340]   If you come to a different solution, at least study your solution and find out why you think
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.880]   it to be the case.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.360]   If you do say, "I'm going to buy a Hyundai Tucson," then know why you're buying it and
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.580]   understand what the data is on it.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:20.940]   In addition, I think there is good reason to choose a model that is ubiquitous.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.740]   Now, here would be where you have to make a distinction between something that's financially
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.680]   practical versus something that's meeting some other need or some other goal.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.180]   If you want a car that is unique, if you're seeking to express your personality with your
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.900]   vehicle or enjoy a toy of some kind, you might purchase some not so common vehicle and that's
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.500]   something that you love.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.100]   There's all kinds of great options out there and you can still do that and be very intelligent
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.100]   about it.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.780]   A Honda S2000 is a wonderful roadster.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.840]   Very fast.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.380]   Very fun to drive.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:01.020]   It has a whole interested little consumer or a whole interested little group of aficionados
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.860]   or a Mazda Miata, for example.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.460]   Wonderful little sports car that you could buy.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.960]   Just a little harder to find than something like a Toyota Camry.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.380]   In general, my preference for practicality is to buy something that's ubiquitous and here
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.460]   are a few advantages of that.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.620]   What you get is you get a vehicle that's easier to find.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.940]   The F-150, the Ford F-150 is the most sold vehicle.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.100]   It's the most popular vehicle in the United States of America.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.260]   I just as soon own a Ford F-150.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260]   They're wonderful.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260]   They're easy to find.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   There's a huge market for them.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.660]   Because there's a huge market, their prices are very, very stable.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.900]   They're well-known, which means it's easy to know if you're getting a value when you're
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.560]   buying and it's easy to sell it into the market when you're selling, which for somebody who's
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:50.660]   not a car person, somebody like Sarah who's looking for transportation, not just a – she's
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.460]   not trying to join the Mazda Miata weekend roadster club.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.540]   For somebody like Sarah who's looking for transportation, that ubiquity can be helpful.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.260]   That ubiquity can lower many of your ownership costs.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.620]   It makes it easier and cheaper to accessorize if you need to change something out.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.540]   It makes it easier and cheaper to find parts if you need to fix something.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.140]   That ubiquity is valuable.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.200]   And so whenever possible, I would like to own a vehicle that's just the same as everybody
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.580]   else owns.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:24.140]   I don't have that need that you might need to look different if you do deal accordingly.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.900]   But for Sarah, I would say buy something that is relatively ubiquitous.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.300]   You also want to buy something that's appropriate to where you live and the lifestyle that you're
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.720]   going to engage in.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.140]   So consider that.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.580]   But don't get taken in by things that are just simply flatly untrue.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:52.260]   For example, you don't necessarily need a Subaru because it snows where you live.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.540]   Sarah – she's going to live in a place with a lot of snow.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:01.060]   She could do extremely well to buy a normal front-wheel drive vehicle and just put snow
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.500]   tires on the thing.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.980]   You don't need four-wheel drive for the snow.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.560]   You don't necessarily need a pickup truck because you own a jet ski.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.240]   Your minivan will tow a jet ski just as well.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.780]   So just think about the things that you're looking for and then consider, "What am I
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.500]   likely to buy and what am I likely to own?"
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.240]   If I lived in rural Oklahoma, I might not own a Prius because I don't know how popular
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.820]   Priuses are in rural Oklahoma.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.540]   I might own an F-150 because it'd be easy to buy, easy to service, easy to sell.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.740]   You figure out where you live and what's appropriate for where you live.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.700]   Now when it comes time to actually buying the thing, where do you go and how do you
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.980]   get it?
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.100]   Well there are a number of different sources.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:53.040]   Basically they would boil down to a dealership or a private party.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.700]   Now dealership could mean different things.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:03.980]   The basic value of a dealership, whether that's a new car dealer, used car dealer, is selection
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.540]   and the fact that they're probably going to have what you need when you need it.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.940]   If you need to buy a car today, you may need to go to a dealer because you can drive in
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.340]   with a friend and you can drive out with a car.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.280]   They're going to have something.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.020]   If you need to buy a Toyota Camry today, you go online, you start searching and you find
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.340]   a dealer that has one.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.540]   That dealer is performing a valuable service in the marketplace of selection.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.840]   They're providing vehicles that are available when you need them.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   They're also going to be compensated for that service.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.900]   That compensation usually comes in the way of a few extra thousand dollars, depending
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.560]   on the value of the car, that you're going to spend in order to pay the dealer their
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.040]   price that they have for the car.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.780]   That may be worth doing, especially if you're shopping for a specific vehicle.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.780]   Back to Ben.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.120]   Let's say that Ben decides that he wants to buy a Toyota Sienna minivan and he's looking
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.300]   for one that is three to five years old.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.320]   He's looking for one that has fewer than 100,000 miles.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:18.240]   He wants electric doors on both sides and he wants the eight-seat model.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:23.840]   When it comes on the dealer's lot, because Ben is specific, he probably should just go
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.120]   ahead and buy it from the dealer.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.460]   Now, strike a good deal.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.440]   Do your best to get a good bargain.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:35.640]   But there's more value for Ben in buying that specific minivan that can last him for a decade
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.120]   versus waiting for one of those to show up in a deal.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.160]   Meanwhile, he only has one car and they're trying to figure that out.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:49.080]   If you've got time, however, it is a good option for you to wait in the marketplace
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.280]   and to shop from a private party.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.940]   There are random approaches to this and there are less random approaches to this.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.120]   The random approach is just to go and drive down the road, especially some secondary road
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.480]   or out in the country.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.720]   I always like to look at cars that are for sale on the side of the road because usually
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.600]   that's a great deal.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.240]   You might find somebody who's just reselling their car.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.300]   They put a sign on it, selling it by the side of the road.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.160]   You can get a great deal that way.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.800]   But the finding of that is very random.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.240]   It's hard to predict where that Toyota Camry is going to be.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.960]   It's hard to predict and to say, "Oh, that minivan or that SUV that I'm looking for is
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.320]   definitely going to be there."
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.880]   And it's very hard to predict that it has those options.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.240]   A great way to do it is, of course, to use the value of the internet and some of the
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.040]   newer versions of classified ads.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.720]   Classified ads had their place.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.520]   Today, most of that has been replaced locally.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.440]   Now, there are a few options here.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.600]   The big one, of course, that everyone knows is Craigslist.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:52.520]   In some of my recent secondary market transactions, I've learned that at least in my area, Craigslist
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.360]   is starting to fade in terms of its usefulness.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:03.080]   The most impressive place that I have found a huge selection of vehicles has been Facebook,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.920]   the Facebook marketplace.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.080]   I hadn't paid much attention to it, but over the last few months, I have done a lot of
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.560]   transactions in the Facebook marketplace and I have been very impressed.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.280]   It has been much more fruitful than Craigslist.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.120]   Here's my theory as to why.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.960]   Most people have Facebook on their phone and it's so easy for them to just snap a picture
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:29.680]   of their car, put a quick title and description and post it, that a lot more people are using
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   that.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.520]   The Craigslist interface on a phone is very clunky, doesn't work very well, and so you
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.280]   have to work to put it on Craigslist.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   Facebook is easy.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.200]   They got a cell phone, boom, it's done.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.360]   So I would encourage you, figure out what you want and then shop heavily on something
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.960]   like Facebook.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.560]   When buying a used car, I think there is a good argument to be made for buying used from
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.160]   a private party.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.120]   Here are some reasons why.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.280]   When you buy from a dealer, it's very hard to know the backstory of that car.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.920]   Usually a dealer has a car either because they've taken it on trade from somebody who's
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.000]   upgrading or because they've bought it at an auction, but you don't know why it's at
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.280]   that auction.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.440]   It's hard to know the history.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   The vast majority of cars are going to be fine, totally fine at a dealer.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.680]   The vast majority are.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:31.600]   But there are going to be cars out there in the marketplace that somebody was having trouble
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   with it.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.680]   They fixed a couple of things and they said, "I'm getting rid of this thing."
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.380]   They trade it into the dealer.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.380]   That dealer takes it.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.280]   They may put it on their lot and resell it or frequently they'll send it down to the
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   auction.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   It goes through the auction.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.080]   Another used car dealer buys it.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.320]   They bring it in and they sell it.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.680]   Now a used car dealer, most of them are going to stand behind their vehicles to some degree.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.240]   They might fix some things that are wrong and they're going to stand behind it to some
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.320]   degree.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.040]   But it's hard to find out the history and be very confident in it.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.640]   You can, of course, check the car facts.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.840]   That doesn't tell you much about it, though.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.520]   It just tells you what was actually listed in the report.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:10.700]   I would much rather pay extra for a vehicle to buy it from somebody who's been a long
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.720]   time owner.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.740]   Whenever I know somebody who's selling a car, I always ask the details in case I might be
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:24.120]   interested in buying it because if I can know the person and know the ownership history
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.360]   of it and get an accurate report of what's wrong with it or what's right with it, that's
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.680]   a really, really important thing.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.500]   You can do that often with the technique of driving down the road in the country or looking
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.640]   on Facebook.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.360]   If you can deal with a person, then most of your skills, your normal interpersonal skills
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.220]   will be useful for you.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.600]   If you're dealing with a dealer in a dealership, now you're into that more kind of combative
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.920]   bargaining.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   Are they honest?
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   Are they dishonest?
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.120]   Use those skills that we don't use every day.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.000]   So if you look on Facebook, let's say Sarah is looking around and she says, "You know
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.520]   what?
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   Josh was right.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.360]   A minivan is the best car for a grad student to buy.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.040]   A minivan gives me safe, reliable, comfortable transportation.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.360]   A minivan is comfortable for a cross-country road trip because it's heavier than a little
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   car.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.360]   I can carry more things with me.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.120]   I can use this minivan to move around the country if I need to.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.520]   I don't have to rent U-Haul trucks.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.120]   I can get a small trailer if I need to and hook it up.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   This will be comfortable.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.480]   I can load up my girlfriends.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.000]   We can put the paddle boards on the roof and go spend a weekend at the beach.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.120]   Like Josh was right, a minivan really is the perfect vehicle for everybody.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.240]   No matter what, I'm going to get one."
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.360]   And of course she takes my advice and says, "All right, I've got about $5,000 saved.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.200]   I want to buy a Toyota minivan, so I'm going to start shopping."
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   And so Sarah goes on Facebook and she just starts looking every day, Toyota minivans,
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.040]   starts interacting with people, asking questions.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.700]   And then she finds somebody who's selling a Toyota minivan.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:00.520]   She goes to see it and she finds herself talking to Ben, 10 years down the road, who's selling
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   his Toyota minivan because now they've had five children.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   They can't fit in it anymore.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   She says, "Ben, how's it going?"
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   "Well, it's good.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.640]   My children have beat this thing up inside a little bit, but it's been a good vehicle
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   for us.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:16.800]   I replaced the timing chain at such and such a miles or I've changed the oil on this level.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.760]   There's a little bit of a noise coming from the right front, but that's just, here's the
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   reason why."
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.840]   Well, now she can interact with Ben, the seller, and actually understand what's happening with
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.840]   it.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.560]   She can then, of course, check the Carfax.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.320]   She would take down the VIN number.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.640]   She would run it through Carfax or one of the competitors.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.020]   And with that data, she would be able to confirm, "Yes, indeed, this vehicle has been registered
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.520]   to Ben for the last seven years, just like he said."
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   Okay, now I know that Ben's probably telling me the truth.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.240]   Now she can start to interact and find out something that's real.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.040]   Now Ben may very well be willing to give her a little deal.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.320]   After all, she just graduated from grad school.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.680]   She's buying her first car.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.280]   She's getting herself set up at her first job after grad school.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.240]   She wants to give her a good deal and help her to get a good start in life.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:12.680]   But on the flip side, if I were Sarah, I would be willing to pay an extra $500 for that vehicle
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.560]   that I was confident in the history.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.720]   I could see Ben and his wife and his children.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.400]   I could know that this car wasn't in Hurricane Harvey and now it's on a dealer lot and it
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.560]   was flooded.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   I could be confident.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.760]   Yes, they've had it for seven years.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.960]   I'm sitting here at their house.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.880]   They're not lying to me.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.960]   All the external data bears out.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.120]   I would pay $500 extra to buy the vehicle of a known history because that would substantially
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:41.400]   lower my risk with buying the vehicle versus the dealer who may or may not be able to know
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.680]   that the electrical system got fried because there's an intermittent problem and every
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:51.480]   now and then when the car is sitting out there at night, the lights start turning on because
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   it was sat through Hurricane Harvey.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.840]   The problem for Sarah is that buying process is going to take a while.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:06.360]   But if she has time and she has money, that can go fine and she can look.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.080]   Now as she's looking, she should be understanding the prices.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   Looking is cheap.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.360]   Calling people is cheap.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.320]   Interacting with Facebook Messenger is cheap.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.560]   Finding out what's going on with this.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.400]   Now Sarah, what you should do is of course check the marketplace.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.100]   When you've narrowed down on a type of vehicle that you're looking for, a range that you're
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.640]   looking for, you start looking at ads.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   Look everywhere.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   Look on Craigslist.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   Look in the classifieds.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   Look at autotrader.com.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   Look on OfferUp.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.000]   Look on Facebook.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.600]   Run the Kelley Blue Book, kbb.com.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.240]   Run the Edmunds values.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.560]   Try to get an idea of what this thing is worth and start to understand, okay, Toyota minivans
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.040]   of this certain age, these many miles, they go for about this much money.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.920]   When you do that, it'll give you confidence.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.640]   Your goal is to develop confidence about the market so that when you see the vehicle that
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.160]   you think is right for you and when you strike the vehicle that's right for you, you can
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.400]   move fast because as a buyer, you want to put as many helpful things in your pocket
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   as possible.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.640]   When you're negotiating, price is only one point of negotiation.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.040]   If you're willing to move fast, that can be an additional point of negotiation.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.800]   If you show up at Ben's door, Ben's selling his minivan that his family has outgrown and
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.360]   you've got cash on you, you may be able to say to Ben, "Listen, I know you've got this
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.200]   thing listed for $4,500.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.560]   You probably could get that if you keep it on the market, but I'd really like to buy
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.220]   it right away and I've got with me $3,800.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.640]   Would you be willing to take $3,800 in exchange for selling it quickly?"
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.400]   You don't know Ben's circumstances.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.280]   He might say, "No, Sarah, I'm in no hurry.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.880]   I'm going to wait for my $4,500."
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.440]   Or he might say, "Yeah, I'll take the $3,800."
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.180]   But Sarah, you should be prepared for that.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.180]   You should be prepared.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.180]   You should have studied the market.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.940]   You should know this is a deal.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:04.120]   And if this is a deal at $4,500, it's fairly priced for a good vehicle, you may be willing
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.960]   to pay it.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.680]   Or you might say, "No, it's just not worth $4,500.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.760]   It's worth $3,800."
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:17.500]   Do your shopping in advance digitally because once you start actually going and looking
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.420]   in person at a vehicle, that starts to incur time and expense.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:28.000]   The expense of time, the expense of going to see something, and then the expense of
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.700]   getting it inspected, which would be my next point.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.020]   When you're looking at a vehicle, it's important just to look at it.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:42.440]   And most of the time, if you'll just simply look at it, you'll be able to see, is this
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.840]   thing cared for or is it not?
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.060]   Check for all the little things.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:51.240]   Go online, look for some checklists of how to investigate a vehicle.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.360]   But just look to see, is this thing cared for?
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.200]   Look to see if the story rings true.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.640]   If Ben has children, look in the inside and say, "Is this thing beat up appropriately
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.680]   for children?"
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.420]   Just use your nose and sniff around and say, "Does this work out?"
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.760]   You have an intuition.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.560]   You have an ability to judge somebody's story.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.080]   What I frequently will do in this situation is I'll just ask the questions multiple times.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.720]   And listen, ask one question, tell me what's the background of the vehicle, what's the
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   story.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.280]   And then when you start to hear those details, start to question again the details.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.000]   Question if there are multiple sellers involved.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.600]   Question each of them separately.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.380]   See if they are telling the same story.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.060]   Ask a little bit more details.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.820]   For example, a pickup truck that I purchased was being sold because there had been a death
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.020]   in the family.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.000]   So I asked the story from a couple people that were involved in the transaction.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.360]   And then after the story was found out, I changed a couple of details.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.840]   And so you said such and such happened?
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.480]   No, no, no, that was wrong.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.560]   And check to see if the story changes.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.040]   Most people aren't going to be able to keep those facts straight.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.840]   So if you could just listen to somebody and think, use that intuition that you have to
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   try to get a sense of if somebody is being honest.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:10.560]   Many people, probably most, are simply going to be honest when they're selling a car.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.440]   And especially if you're buying at private party where you're talking to the owner, they're
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.740]   just going to tell you here's what's going on with it.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.320]   But you do want to get it inspected.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.620]   The way to do that is make sure that you're confident that this is a car that you want
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.140]   to buy.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.240]   Go ahead and talk to the owner and try to strike the deal.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.920]   So let's say that Ben is selling it for $4,500.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.640]   You say, Ben, listen, I'd like to buy the car.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.280]   I know that you could probably get $4,500 if you keep it on the market.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.520]   But if you'd like to sell it today, I know this is really what I'd like to have.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Would you be willing to sell it today for $4,000 cash?
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.360]   And when you're dealing in this market, you should be dealing with cash, $20 bills, $100
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.520]   bills, et cetera.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   Cash speaks.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.120]   Now, I've never found that actually splaying out the cash necessarily makes that big of
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   a difference, kind of the dramatic thing of let's put these bills here.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.880]   Maybe some people with more flair than I have can make that work.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.920]   I've tried but it hasn't really worked for me.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.480]   But dealing with cash means that the transaction is simple.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.520]   Once you buy the car, it's going to be simple.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.960]   It's going to be owned.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.240]   If Ben says, yeah, I'd be willing to take $4,000 if you take it today, then you say,
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   OK.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.040]   But my only thing is I need to get it inspected.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.880]   I've always been able to have it when I've done it and I've made the mistake enough to
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.960]   know I'm not good enough of a mechanic to not get the vehicle inspected.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.600]   I would make the deal and depending on the vehicle, depending on where it is, if you're
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.360]   out in the country, it's one thing.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.560]   But get it arranged to get it inspected.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.000]   Usually, you can find and arrange an inspection by somebody close by.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.080]   One time I bought a vehicle in Atlanta.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.480]   I just simply looked around and I found somebody nearby and I made the deal.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.760]   I'm going to take it to a local shop.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:56.520]   It's better for you to spend $150 at some local shop just to get it inspected than to
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.280]   get it a little bit cheaper and not have it inspected.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.800]   It'll be worth it to know if there are any problems.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.680]   And it's especially worth it in advance.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.800]   Even if you got to do something close, it's not your normal mechanic, it's worth it to
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.640]   get it done in advance.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.400]   Sometimes you could hire a mobile mechanic or ask your mechanic to come with you.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.520]   But I would get it inspected by a mechanic.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.940]   If you have a friend who is knowledgeable and experienced and works on cars, that may
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.640]   be a good person to have come with you.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.920]   And there are people who would be far more thorough than a mechanic and far more effective.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.640]   If you don't have that, at least take it for an inspection.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.880]   It'll be well worth your time and your money.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.720]   Usually the buyer will expect that.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.800]   You may leave another car with them, leave some keys.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.620]   You may need to put up collateral.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.520]   What I have done at times is said, "Our deal is for $4,000.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   Here's the deal.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:54.240]   I'll give you $100 deposit that's nonrefundable to show you how serious I am and $1,000 refundable
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.120]   deposit with you while I take the car to get it inspected.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.200]   You keep the title, of course.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.740]   I'll take the car."
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.640]   So that person has $1,100 of my money.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.560]   If I take it to the mechanic and I come back and it's in great shape, then I'll go ahead
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.160]   and pay the balance.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.200]   If I don't want the car, then they'll give me my $1,000 back.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.720]   I'll give them the car and they'll keep my $100 deposit.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.440]   You don't even always have to do the nonrefundable deposit.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.820]   But those are the types of things that I would have ready and planned of how to do it.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.600]   So take it to a mechanic.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.360]   Get it inspected before you do the deal.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.600]   Depending on what you find from the mechanic, you may do the deal under the original terms
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.640]   or you may need to renegotiate the deal.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.800]   Most people who are selling a used car don't know that much about its actual condition.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.580]   They may have fixed the things, but yeah, there's the sound from the right rear tire,
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.680]   but they don't know why that's there.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.060]   And so find out from the mechanic.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.400]   Get an itemized list of what's wrong with it.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.800]   And then you've got to approach this reasonably.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.520]   Here's where your market research is so important.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:59.800]   Sometimes you'll find a substantial problem with a vehicle and you're well within your
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.040]   prerogative to use that as a negotiation point.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:10.600]   Listen, we've got our deal here for five grand, but man, this thing needs $2,000 worth of
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   expenses.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.200]   I don't know if you knew this about it, but I'm just not willing to do that.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.720]   Will you take $3,500 for it?
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.320]   The seller might take that or they might not.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.280]   Be prepared to walk away if the list is long.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.880]   Far cheaper for you to lose a $100 deposit and an afternoon going to look at a car and
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.280]   taking it to a mechanic than to buy something that's going to result in hundreds or thousands
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.440]   of dollars of repair bills later.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.040]   Don't worry about losing the $100.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.720]   Don't buy something that's a bad deal.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.620]   But frequently you'll find, "Hey, this thing checks out."
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:49.160]   You may negotiate another couple hundred dollars off and you buy the vehicle.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.140]   The process of buying a vehicle is very, very simple.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.160]   Basically all you need is the title.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.880]   Now technically most people would advise that you also get a bill of sale and that's a good
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.180]   idea.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:06.240]   But really all you need is the title.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.280]   There's a phrase in legal circles that possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:14.120]   If you're going to leave with a vehicle, keys, and a title, you pretty much got what you
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   need.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.880]   The wrinkle might be if you're buying a vehicle that has been financed.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.920]   If the vehicle has been financed, it's owned by the bank, the seller is not going to be
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.400]   able to give you the title.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.060]   That might be good for you when you're buying something that's newer.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:36.200]   You will find that a seller who – sometimes you'll find someone who's trying to sell
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   a car.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   They owe money on it.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.560]   They just want to get out of the debt.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:45.120]   In that case, then what you'll do is you'll sign a bill of sale between you and the buyer.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   Go online.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   You can type it up yourself.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.220]   You can write it up on a legal pad, whatever.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.560]   Just write up a bill of sale.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.920]   You'll give them the money and then you'll arrange with the bank and the bank will send
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.400]   you the title.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.120]   Just do a web search and you'll find that.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   It's very simple.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.680]   I do like to buy cars that are a little bit older.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.760]   I think that there is a sweet spot in the market.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.120]   Depending on the model, there's a sweet spot in the market when you start to get to
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:15.760]   a 10-year-old car because cars that are older than 10 years old are not really able to be
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.440]   financed, at least not in conventional financing.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:24.840]   For someone like you, Sarah, if it's 2018, if you go and you look, a vehicle that's 2008
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:32.500]   is a very – or older – or newer, is a very serviceable vehicle, but it's not financeable.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.680]   But usually in that space, you'll have – that car will be paid off.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.460]   There's nobody that's doing 10-year loans on cars.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.460]   That's a sweet spot.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.860]   Usually if you're shopping in that range, you're not going to have to come up with
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.140]   a big – the person will have the title.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:54.100]   You need the title issued from the state, the vehicle and the keys, and then you just
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.180]   give them the money.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.220]   In this situation, I think cash is the best.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.980]   When you're dealing at the lower end of the market here and I'm talking cars of
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:08.740]   $2,000 to $6,000, $8,000, something like that, $10,000 perhaps, cash is the best.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:14.740]   As a seller, I would not accept a cashier's check or checks for vehicles in that range.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.220]   I want cash.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.980]   Just even with a cashier's check, it's a very good thing, but it's still – I
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.740]   was burned one time on doing that.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.580]   So I would only deal in cash.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.580]   So cash is just simple.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.580]   It's clean.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.540]   You can do the transaction and you're done.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.380]   You need to walk away with the title and the car and a bill of sale is fine.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.900]   Drive it home.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.900]   Take it down.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.900]   Get it tagged.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.380]   Get your own title and you got your vehicle.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.620]   It's really pretty simple.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.980]   I can't think of any more practical information than I have given you.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:56.860]   So Sarah, if you were my sister, I would say take the money that you have, keep it low,
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:02.740]   buy either a Toyota Prius, a Toyota Camry or a Toyota Sienna minivan.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.740]   You can buy them for – get – look in that 8 to 12-year-old range, somewhere between
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.580]   80,000 to 120,000 miles.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.820]   Even more is fine.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.060]   Here's one comment for you on miles.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:22.300]   Miles make a huge difference in the market price of the car.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:30.620]   I have access through – I have had access to the auction systems and the dealer auction
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:35.940]   systems and I went through and did an analysis one time on the actual market price and for
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:42.540]   dealers, miles make a huge, huge difference in the cost of the car.
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.380]   So if you can go with higher miles, it makes a big, big difference.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:52.700]   But as a car owner, I am not so concerned with miles.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:58.220]   Each part of the car has different things that are going to have wear and problems.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:04.860]   So certainly, a vehicle with a lot of miles is going to have functionally more wear than
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.620]   a vehicle with fewer miles.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.180]   But it may not actually be a problem.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:15.260]   I would rather buy a vehicle that's been used steadily and has 100,000 miles because
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:21.940]   the person had a 100-mile commute every day where every day it's been warmed up.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.660]   It's driven long distances.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.060]   So that burns off the water and the fuel.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.700]   It keeps the vehicle in good running order.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.100]   It's been – had regular maintenance.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:35.140]   I'd rather buy that vehicle with more miles than one that sat around and the person has
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   been in and out of town.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.900]   They haven't used it regularly and who knows what's going on with it.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.980]   It's one of those things where there's just not a strong argument one way or the
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.980]   other.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.460]   The other thing I would say is that how many miles are you going to put on it?
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.660]   If you're not going to put so many on it, you can buy a minivan or a Camry or something
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:57.460]   with 120,000 miles and it's got another effective lifespan of 180,000 miles.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.620]   You'll never go through that period of time.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.700]   With vehicles, some things will need to be fixed and replaced based upon the years of
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.860]   ownership.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.060]   Some things will need to be fixed and replaced based upon mileage.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:15.140]   You'll need a new battery based upon the age of the battery.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.580]   The miles are not such a big deal.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.540]   It's the age of the battery.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.820]   And so having a vehicle with more miles, that's not a problem.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:28.100]   You're going to need to replace your brakes based upon the miles, not based upon the age.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.840]   But maybe those brakes were just recently replaced.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.900]   With tires, there's a component of age and miles.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.540]   But in general, most of the stuff, as long as you buy a car that's relatively inexpensive
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.740]   and you're prudent, you don't have payments.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.020]   I've really never gotten burned.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:50.580]   The only vehicle I've ever gotten burned on is the one that I replied previously with
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.620]   where I talked about the mistakes.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.900]   And that was a unique situation, not a normal situation like this.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.020]   And it was my fault.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.740]   I forgot the last piece of advice, Sarah, that I need to give to you is calculate your
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.340]   ownership costs and run things like insurance.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:09.500]   So you should get insurance quotes on the things that you are considering buying.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.680]   And you should consider what those insurance quotes will be.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:18.260]   What I have learned with insurance is sometimes the vehicle choice is more important than
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.500]   the value of it.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:26.800]   With a car insurance company, the value of the vehicle is a known quantity.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:33.860]   If the vehicle is totaled, then they know how much that's going to be worth.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:39.220]   But the liability payments are the lesser known quantity.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:44.460]   And so sometimes you could have much cheaper insurance for a vehicle that is more modern,
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:50.100]   newer, has the modern safety equipment than for a vehicle that is older and doesn't have
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.940]   a lot of safety equipment.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:57.860]   My '98 Toyota Corolla that I owned for a while, that I bought for $500, had what I
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.660]   consider to be very expensive insurance.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.120]   I only kept liability coverage on it, the legally mandated liability coverage.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.060]   But because it didn't have modern airbags, it had analog brakes, but it didn't have a
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:15.340]   lot of the modern stuff, I think statistically it's not a very safe car to drive.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.780]   And so it would result in potentially higher medical liability for the insurance company.
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:24.780]   If we compare that to some of the minivans that I have owned, the minivans were very
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.100]   inexpensive to insure.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:32.860]   I bought a – a number of years ago I bought a 2007 Hyundai Entourage minivan.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.500]   It was very inexpensive to insure because it had five-star crash ratings all around
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.980]   minivans – all around airbags, et cetera.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.460]   Number of years ago I bought a 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan for $3,000.
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:49.420]   I think it was rock solid, works great, still drive it.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.140]   But it had great, great crash ratings.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.100]   So the insurance costs are very low.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.040]   So calculate those costs in advance.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.980]   And if you're thinking about buying something, make sure that you know what those costs are.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.180]   Now back to Ben's question as we finish.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:10.680]   Ben is considering replacing his car and keep going like they are without robbing any other
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:16.860]   categories of their budget, not buying – not paying debt, or going ahead and buying a Toyota
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.660]   or Hyundai minivan for cash for his wife to drive and then for him going ahead and taking
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.700]   over the Hyundai Tucson until it dies.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:31.700]   So Ben, in short, I would say if I were in your shoes, I would go ahead and purchase
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.540]   the minivan.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.980]   When you're in a situation like that where your car is totaled – this happened to my
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:40.820]   wife and to me a number of years ago.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.540]   We had at the time a Ford Escape and a Ford Expedition.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.420]   We had a Ford Escape and a Ford Expedition.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:54.340]   And when you are in a situation where you have ownership of vehicles, generally doing
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.180]   nothing is the best financial course.
[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.880]   Usually just staying with what you have is the best.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.820]   You own these vehicles, just keep them.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.380]   So don't make any changes.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.580]   But when you have an accident and we had an accident – I had an accident.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.500]   We were together but I had an accident.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.300]   We were in the Ford Escape.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.820]   We wound up being totaled by the insurance company.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.160]   Now you need to make a whole new decision and that's what you're doing.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.780]   So now you wipe everything away.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.320]   You start with a blank slate and you say, "Now, looking forward over the coming years,
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.580]   what is going to meet the needs of our family in the best way possible?"
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.740]   What we did at that time was buy a minivan.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.540]   I had already known that I planned to buy a minivan.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.780]   There was no reason for me to sell the vehicles that were working great and buy a minivan.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780]   We bought a minivan.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.140]   It was a great decision.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.480]   For all the reasons that I have exhaustively discussed.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.700]   But what I would do if I were in your shoes, I would buy a minivan.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:56.900]   I would try to – I would not invade my emergency fund unless I found a screaming deal after
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.640]   I analyzed the market and I would not take out debt.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.460]   So I would use the insurance payment.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:09.320]   I would seriously consider using other funds but I would try to buy something that is going
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:15.540]   to last for the longest period possible and to be new and in good condition but not particularly
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   fancy.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.180]   With young children, I hate having fancy stuff.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.620]   I would much rather have an older vehicle that I'm not worried about, that we can go
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:27.420]   to the beach, we can go to the park, we can put the – they're going to get it dirty.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.940]   So why buy a new vehicle that's just going to beat up, be beat up?
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:38.240]   So with anywhere from $6,200 to $6,000 to $10,000, man, you can buy a great car in that
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   range.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.600]   Thank you for listening to today's show, you radical you.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.080]   Before you go, I have one question for you.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.000]   Was there an idea in today's show that helped you?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Were you inspired?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Were you motivated?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.920]   Did you get an idea on how you can earn more or spend less money or invest more wisely
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.520]   or perhaps protect yourself from catastrophe and insulate yourself from financial disaster
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.520]   or just improve your life and your lifestyle?
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.640]   Well, if so, I have three requests for you.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.840]   Number one, take action.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   Listening doesn't improve your life.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.720]   Doing, however, can revolutionize your life.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.480]   Number two, take the idea or concept that you learned from me and go and teach somebody
