[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.100]   Pastor John, in its most basic form, how do you define biblical inerrancy?
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.360]   Before I go to the definition of inerrancy, let me give you the soil or the roots of why
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.160]   you'd even ask that question.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.520]   The 66 books of the Christian canon is what I'm talking about when I say Scripture or
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.320]   Bible.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.660]   They are, we believe, inspired by God, 2 Timothy 3.16.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.960]   Or to say it another way, 2 Peter 1.21, "No prophecy was ever produced by the will of
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.680]   man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.280]   So the reason inerrancy rises is because we claim this book is the very Word of God.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.360]   The center of God's revelation is Jesus, and He's called the Word of God incarnate.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   And He said, "Scripture cannot be broken."
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.080]   He said, "Until heaven and earth pass away, not a neota, not a dot, little as teeny little
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.360]   dot, neota, will pass away from the law until all is accomplished."
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.760]   So, the Word of God validates the Word of God written.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.880]   The Word of God incarnate validates the Word of God written in the Old Testament.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.320]   And then He commissioned apostles to speak His Word as the foundation of the church,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.520]   and He promised when the Spirit of truth comes, truth, Spirit of truth comes, He'll guide
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480]   you into all truth.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.440]   So Jesus stands at the center as the Word of God incarnate, and looking back, He validates
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   the Word of God written, and looking forward, He validates the Word of God written, and
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.120]   the apostles took it that way because they said amazing things about their authority.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.520]   Paul said, for example, in 1 Corinthians 14, 37, "If anyone thinks that he's a prophet
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.560]   or spiritual, he should acknowledge the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.000]   If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.240]   That's incredible.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.080]   And the only reason he has any right to say that is because he said, "We are teaching
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.960]   in words spoken not from men but from the Holy Spirit because Jesus promised, 'I'm
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.880]   going to guide my apostles into all truth.'"
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.840]   So there's the reason why the whole issue of inerrancy even arises.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:49.480]   We have a book in front of us that claims to be the inspired Word of God.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   And since God doesn't lie and doesn't make mistakes, we say the Bible doesn't lie,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.800]   doesn't make mistakes.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.920]   What does error mean?
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.960]   If we're going to say inerrant—and by the way, I'm not one of those who gets bent
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.220]   out of shape about using the word inerrancy as over infallibility or truthfulness.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.100]   To me, the average person out there, if you say the Bible is completely and totally true
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.460]   and the Bible is completely and totally infallible and the Bible is completely and totally inerrant,
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.340]   they're not hearing any distinctions.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.520]   And I'm not either.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.640]   So I don't like it when people quibble about these words.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.300]   I think it's good to use them all to make sense out of the word inerrant.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   No error.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.220]   We have to define error.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.980]   What is it that isn't in this book?
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.720]   And we have to define error in terms of the author's intention.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.880]   And in the Bible, since we've got God inspiring this book, we've got God's intention mediated
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.300]   through the intention of human authors and going beyond them—I would say always going
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.180]   beyond them—because he sees all the innumerable necessary implications of what they can't
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.180]   see.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:26.500]   I include in meaning or intention the necessary implications of what an author says, some
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.860]   of which he can see and some of which he can't, and God can see them all.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.900]   And therefore, when I think of the intention of the author, I'm thinking all that the
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:46.020]   human author intended to teach and all that God intended to teach, which is bigger always
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.860]   than what humans can see in their implications of what God inspired them to write.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:02.340]   Now, the reason intention is crucial is because there are all kinds of ways that we say things
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.500]   that could be taken as error, which aren't error, if people didn't pay attention to
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.380]   our intention.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.700]   I might say, "Tony, you scared me to death walking in here like that."
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.820]   You would not respond to me, "You're a liar," or "You're a fool because you're still breathing."
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.940]   You wouldn't, because you wouldn't know this is an idiom for "You really scared me."
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.800]   You wouldn't quibble over the fact that I'm not dead.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.080]   You wouldn't say, "Error, error."
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.500]   And so we have to be alert to those kinds of things in the Bible.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.820]   What did the author mean or what did he intend?
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.640]   Another example would be in Job, the book of Job.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.380]   You got 29 chapters of erroneous theology.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:54.180]   Job is putting sentences in his inerrant book that are full of errors.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.060]   The counsel of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar is bad counsel.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.020]   And Job is telling the story and including the bad counsel.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.480]   So what you have to do to say, "Now, how is the book of Job inerrant?"
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.160]   The book of Job is inerrant, not because it doesn't include stupid sentences from Eliphaz,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.400]   but because Job has written it in such a way that we know they're stupid and we know they're
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.240]   erroneous, and thus he makes a true point by pointing out the falsehood of the bad theology
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   in his book.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.080]   That's the way literature works.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.300]   That's the way we talk.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.640]   We are inerrant when the thing we're teaching is true and not false.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   So what I mean by the Bible being inerrant is that the biblical authors, with God as
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:59.000]   their guide, do not teach anything false or command, as God's will, anything displeasing
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to God.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.560]   Or to say it another way, what the authors intend for us to understand or obey, properly
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.920]   understood in its nearer and wider context, is true.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.240]   It's not misleading.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.680]   It's not errant.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.560]   It's not false.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.520]   It corresponds to the way things really are.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.480]   It commends behaviors and attitudes that God really wills.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.080]   It raises many questions, and I would refer people to the Chicago Statement on Biblical
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.380]   Inerrancy because that document is sometimes treated superficially as being naive.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.480]   It's not naive.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.680]   If you read carefully the distinctions that are made in that document, it's a good guide
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   for us, I think.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.400]   So let me just close by saying I love this truth because I love the Bible because I love
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   God.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.520]   God, Word, inerrant, to me, are continuous.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.680]   You can't break off—I can't break off anywhere in there and feel like I have treated
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.740]   God or His Word or the truth honorably.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.840]   From history and from my own experience, it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.780]   of the truth of the Bible.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:21.640]   We humans are incapable of finding out what we absolutely have to know.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   We can't overcome sin.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.000]   We can't escape the wrath of God.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.040]   We can't become new creatures.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.240]   We can't walk pleasing to the Lord.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:36.200]   God must reveal these things to us or we perish, and this he has done and continues to do by
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.860]   means of a written Word, the Bible.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.920]   And when a person has understood what the Bible teaches, he has understood the revelation
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.280]   of God infallibly, inerrantly, verbally.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.360]   Yes, very good.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.880]   And please check out the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which can be found
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.920]   online for free, and it's not that long either.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   I think it's under 4,000 words or so.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.760]   The easiest way to find it is just to Google the title, the Chicago Statement on Biblical
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   Inerrancy.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.180]   Well, do podcast preachers, preachers like you, Pastor John, and do podcasts like this
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.340]   one, make local church pastors irrelevant?
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   Why or why not?
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.380]   We'll talk about this question tomorrow.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.380]   I'm your host, Tony Rank.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.980]   We'll see you tomorrow.
