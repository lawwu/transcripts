[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, our show where you, the viewer, select the topics.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.680]   Remember, if you have a question for us, send us, askthecomponshow@gmail.com. I'm joined,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.800]   as always, by producer extraordinaire Duncan Hill. Duncan, how's it going?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.480]   Good, good. How are you?
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520]   All right. Duncan and I have been scouring the email for the last couple of weeks, and
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.040]   one of the cool things we're seeing is there's starting to be some trends in there. We've
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.320]   been doing the show for about a month now, I guess, and our inbox is full, and so we're
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.000]   getting tons of questions about things like taxes. That's a big one. People really care
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.200]   about their taxes. A lot of stuff on retirement accounts, what kind of retirement accounts
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.480]   to use. At least one question a week from a young person who says, "Hey, Ben, I want
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.400]   to use two or three times levered S&P 500 ETFs in my retirement account. I swear I'm
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.320]   going to hold it for the long term. I know the risks. I don't mind losing 90% of my
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.040]   portfolio. Will you please sign off on it for me?" We're going to get to all these
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.720]   questions eventually. One of the ones we hear a lot is housing, right? I think, Duncan,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960]   our first question today is another one on housing. There's a ton of questions, obviously,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.200]   because the real estate market is going bonkers. What do we got, Duncan?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.560]   First up today, we have a question from Anthony who writes, "I'm a 33-year-old single male
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.680]   looking to move to Dallas, Texas. I'm looking at places in the $400,000 range, and I have
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.480]   enough capital to buy a home outright, but I'm trying to decide whether I should still
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.600]   take out a mortgage or rent a house and invest the $400,000 in the market instead of paying
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.080]   cash. Dallas property taxes can run as high as 2% alone, not to mention all of the other
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   fees that come along with owning a home. What would you guys do in my situation?"
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.660]   This is a good thing that this 33-year-old is coming in with eyes wide open, because
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.720]   I think right now it would be hard to ignore the fact that everyone thinks you should own
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.560]   a house. There's tons of peer pressure going on. The Case-Shiller National Housing Price
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.520]   Index is up 20% year over year. Everyone is seeing these huge gains, and there's a lot
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.760]   of peer pressure from family and friends that you have to buy a house. Listen, this is the
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.080]   next step in life. You're in your mid-30s. It's time to settle down.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   Listen, there's a lot of pros to settling down and buying a house. For me, personally,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.520]   we bought a house because we wanted to be in a great school district for our kids. I
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.080]   think it provides a sense of stability and permanence in your life. You have a house,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.480]   you can make it your own. We actually built a new house when we moved in, so we got to
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.940]   put our own touches on it. You can do your landscaping, all that stuff.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.080]   I think there's a level of psychic income you get from owning a house, where it's yours
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760]   and it's almost like these non-monetary benefits. I also think a fixed rate mortgage is one
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.600]   of the best hedges you can get for inflation over the long term, because you can plan out
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.280]   from your personal finances exactly what your payment's going to be.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360]   Then a bonus on top of all that is you get to build some equity that you can eventually
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.800]   do something else with, whether it's rolling it over into a down payment for another house,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   or potentially taking it out and using that for something.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.360]   There are some downsides, though, that a lot of people don't talk about. It's basically
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.040]   impossible to calculate the return on your home, because there's so many other ancillary
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.920]   costs involved. You have closing when you move into the house. You have realtor fees.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   You have upkeep and repairs and maintenance. There's transaction costs at closing.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.200]   If you want to sell your home, there's a lot of frictions involved to get out of it. It's
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.240]   not like you're just going to get the price that's listed. There's also, you lose flexibility.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.000]   This is a single person. They may not want to be in this house for the long term. They
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.600]   may get a chance for a career or for a relationship, move somewhere else.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.640]   I almost look at a house not as much as an investment, but a form of consumption. The
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.280]   other thing is borrowing at a fixed rate is great, but it's also a leveraged investment.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.580]   That can work in your way positively when houses are going up, but it can go the other
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.800]   way when houses and prices are going down. It's an illiquid asset and you lose some flexibility.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   Owning a house is not for everyone. Two-thirds of the country owns a home in the United States.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.720]   Some people don't own one because they can't afford it. Some people don't own it because
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360]   it's just not right for them.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.080]   I think here's some of the questions you want to ask yourself. How stable is my life and
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   my career? Can I see myself living in this area, this neighborhood, this community for
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.640]   the long term? Is this a place I can see myself owning for at least seven years, I'd say?
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.080]   Because, other than that, you're not building much equity unless housing prices just go
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   to the moon. If you're not living in it for at least five to seven years, I'd say. This
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.600]   is not something that you want to buy and move out of right away. I think you want to
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.680]   make sure this is something for the long term.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   - Yeah, I look forward to being able to paint walls one day, though, and actually put holes
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.440]   in the wall without having to worry about having to fix it back after a year or two.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.720]   We've been in our home for five years now, and I think we still haven't hung anything
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.480]   on the walls yet. It's still just the same.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   - That's great.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.680]   - Yeah, I'm not much of a landscape guy either. That stuff kind of annoys me. There's a lot
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.120]   of stuff that it really depends what you want to get out of your life. How much flexibility
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.280]   and do you want to be tied down to something like that? I think as a single person, honestly,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.200]   moving into a place where they take care of all the lawn care and all that stuff for you,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   that sounds wonderful to me.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   - Yeah.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   - All right, what do we got next?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   - Okay, so next up we have a question from Greg, and so Greg has a pretty short and sweet
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.240]   one. "When looking at your own personal portfolio, where do you guys stand on how much inheritance
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.120]   to leave your kids? I recently heard Shaq saying that he's rich but his kids aren't
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.520]   and he wants them to work for what they have in life. I agree with this sentiment and would
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.760]   be curious to hear your thoughts."
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.560]   - All right, I've never done a financial planning question with Shaq before, but I'm a big planner.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.000]   I like to think long-term and plan out the future, but this is even like long, long-term
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   for me, and I obviously think about this stuff, but this is a challenge because you're striking
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.400]   a balance between wanting your kids to succeed on their own and learn about how the world
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.880]   operates, but also wanting to make sure that they're secure because they're your kids,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.920]   right? So Greg asked if Josh and Michael and I have any thoughts on this. So I'll bring
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.600]   in one of the other three here. So Josh Brown, come on in. Let's see, there he is.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   - What's up, guys?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   - Josh.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.280]   - This is so exciting. It's my new favorite show.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.000]   - Let's do it. Your kids are older than mine, but you still have plenty of time left here.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.600]   How do you think about this? I know Buffett and some of these other billionaires have
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.640]   talked about it, but how do you think about this in terms of trying to set your kids up
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.160]   for success without spoiling them?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.800]   - Yeah, so to be clear, I don't have Buffett money or Shaq money, and I don't anticipate
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   having Buffett money or Shaq money. So I'm pretty certain what Shaq is telling his kids
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.200]   is that they're not worth a hundred million, but it's doubtful they won't be set up with
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   five or 10 million to do what they want with.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.200]   - How are they ever going to survive, right?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.280]   - Listen, I think there are a lot of really great models for what you should be doing
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.960]   when you reach that level of success, which is not going to be most people, obviously,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   but like Rick Ross, one of my favorite rappers, he's got a whole bunch of these Wingstop franchise
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   locations. His kid turned 16 and he gave the kid a Wingstop. And it's like, "Oh, wow, he
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.800]   just handed this kid a half million dollar, you know, what it would cost somebody else
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.640]   to buy this franchise." No, he just gave this kid the responsibility. Like, "It's great.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.520]   All right, I own a Wingstop." That's not like a ticket to riches and fame. You have to like
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.760]   grind it out. So the kid's obviously going to be in school, but he's got to be involved
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.000]   in hiring people, making sure the supplies are showing up, making sure the property around
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.800]   it is being kept up. Like, I think that's really fly to do for a kid. Like, so I love
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.360]   that idea. I'm not giving my kids a Wingstop, but just that concept of...
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.480]   - By the way, have you ever tried it before? I have one right by my office. I just went
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   in. Yes.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:50.440]   - Lemon pepper. Two words, lemon pepper. Okay. Wingstop is great. But I like the idea
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.400]   of an inheritance being not just like, here's a pile of money or here's a trust, but like,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   here's a responsibility that also comes along with this wonderful gift that I'm giving you.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.800]   And like, that's the balance of being wealthy is like, the wealthier you are, the more shit
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.920]   you got to take care of, right?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   - It's also hard to keep your kids happy. So there's a study from like the Chronicle
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.480]   of Philanthropy where they asked people who inherited a lot of money, like what amount
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.120]   of money would you have inherited that would make you feel totally secure? And on average,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.360]   every single one of them, no matter how much they made from like 200,000 to a couple million,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.320]   the answer was always double of what they got. So you're probably not going to make
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.480]   your kids happy either way, depending on how much... Here's the way I'm looking at this.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.000]   I want to communicate with my kids exactly what's going to happen when I die. That's
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   kind of morbid to think about. But when I get to that age, here's what's going to happen.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.880]   Here's the money stuff. Here's potentially how much you're going to get. But I'm also
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.800]   going to enjoy that money with my kids while I'm here. Vacations and...
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   - That's it.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   - Right?
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.160]   - This is what we do for a living. We're having these conversations with households all over
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:06.280]   the country. What the boomers are doing now is they're saying, I want my children and
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:14.680]   their children to enjoy the money while I'm alive to see it. It's not selfish. It's like,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.120]   what is the point of me holding on to this and trying to grow it by another 50% over
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   the next 20 years?
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.400]   - The kids are going to love those experiences and those memories way more than more money
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   when you die.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   - No doubt. So you know what we're seeing a lot of? We're seeing a lot of parents who
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.000]   don't just sell their house and move away, but keep their house so they can be nearby
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.720]   the kids and help raise them, the grandkids, and help raise them, but then also have the
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.800]   vacation house. So if you're rich, that's great. You could afford to do that. Not every
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   parent can.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.760]   - Hey, can you have a talk with my parents then and tell them to move into town when
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   I need a babysitter? Because my parents still live three hours away.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.760]   - How far away are they?
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.440]   - Well, they help when they're around. They live like three hours away. It's a good buffer.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.080]   - I mean, that's not bad. We moved into the town where Sprinkles' mom and dad live, and
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   they have bedrooms for her and her sister. When they were growing up, those bedrooms
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:13.480]   now have been converted into bedrooms for my kids. So it is an awesome setup because
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   we could just put them there for a Saturday night, and they love it. The kids love it.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.320]   The grandparents had the last 15 years to watch my kids go from being babies to teenagers
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.920]   and be very much in their lives. And I want that because I've seen that. Now that I've
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.320]   seen that as a parent, when I'm a grandparent, which is not for many years, let's hope, but
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.840]   I want that. And that takes money to be able to do, obviously, to keep the house that you're
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.200]   no longer have kids there, but you're going to keep it running as though you do. You got
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.800]   to plan for that, especially if you also want to be in Florida half the year or whatever.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.120]   So that's the way that I'm trying to think about it. And then the inheritance question,
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   which I think we started with, it's like, what can I do today to make my kids' lives
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.560]   easier as they become adults? And a lot of that is going to be like helping them get
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.240]   a foothold in an apartment in the city so they don't have to live at home for as long,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.440]   like doing stuff like that. That's so much more important than what am I leaving them
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.280]   in 50 years or 40 years, right? So I think we're on the same page there.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.960]   All right, Duncan, next question.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.240]   Poor cousin Greg, you know, that's what I keep thinking about, that inheritance. Okay,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.920]   so next up we have a question from Bennett. So maybe our youngest question asker of all
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   time.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   I think so.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.800]   So I am 17 years old and have been investing for three years, which is impressive. I have
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.320]   funneled away money I earn into my portfolio in which I own a wide range of stocks, almost
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.240]   70 in total. About 10% of the money is in crypto split between Ethereum, Solana, and
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.360]   Polkadot. My question is about how many stocks I should own. As you diversify to preserve
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   wealth and concentrate to create it, I'm wondering how specialized I should be. I think they
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.400]   mean concentrated. They should be, since they can afford a lot of risk at their age. And
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.760]   then they go on to tell us their top holdings.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:11.180]   First of all, applause to Bennett here. This is amazing for a 17-year-old, right?
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.180]   Just asking that question.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.080]   Yes, and well done. And yes, when I was 17, I knew nothing about anything. I didn't know
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.400]   the stock market existed. So, kudos to you. One thing I want to say for a 17-year-old
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.640]   is, when you're holding these stocks, that's great. And I think there's studies that have
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.680]   done that said, well, up to 30 or 50 stocks will get you pretty well diversified. You
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.560]   don't need many more than that. The Dow has 30 stocks in it.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.960]   But my question is not portfolio-related. It's how much time and effort do you actually
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.680]   want to spend here? Studying these stocks, figuring out the trends. You're young. This
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.040]   is great, because by investing in individual stocks, you're learning. And I think there's
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   a lot to that, where that's a great way to learn how the stock market works, how businesses
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.640]   work. I just don't want this person to spend every waking hour paying attention to stocks
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.800]   and reading 10 Qs and all these things when they could be doing something else.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.100]   So, I just don't want you to go overboard and figure out the balance between tracking
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.120]   a portfolio and just maybe making your life easier.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.920]   Yeah, I think you can follow five stocks that make up 20% of your portfolio on a quarterly
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.520]   basis. Let's say you're going to listen to five conference calls on the Quarter app,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.600]   which is what I would recommend to every 17-year-old, quite frankly. Put that app on your phone.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.400]   Follow the stocks that you've heard about via conference calls. So, I think that's manageable.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.160]   So here's the thing. Where it gets unmanageable is if you think you're going to wake up every
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   day and do trades. That's where it gets out of hand because then you win, you lose, you
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.200]   lose track. Am I even up? What was the point of this? Now I'm going to owe taxes. It gets
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.800]   out of hand when you're being extremely active.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.000]   But if you pick five companies like that and they're a fifth of your portfolio, maybe the
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.280]   better thing to do is not find another five companies or another 10 companies, but maybe
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.080]   layer in some index funds. And that way you get the best of both worlds. To Ben's point,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.160]   you don't learn anything by owning index funds. But the other side of that is index funds
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.320]   will make sure that whatever the next big winning stocks are, that you're allocated
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.660]   toward them because they will bubble up within the S&P. So put those names back up.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.800]   Core and Explore, right? Yeah, the Core and the Index Funding Explore elsewhere.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.760]   Put those names back up. Duncan, can you do that? The question.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.040]   Yeah, just one second.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:44.600]   AMD. All right. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are three of the top seven market caps anyway,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   I think. So you're missing Amazon and Google, whatever. No big deal.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.360]   Hey, this guy, he has CrowdStrike and Nvidia. This is definitely a Josh Brown fan.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:00.560]   And AMD. Right. No, this guy. Right. So these are gigantic tech stocks. I don't know if
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:10.240]   your position six through ten are like natural gas companies or banks or pharmaceuticals,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.640]   but somehow I doubt it. So what the index fund would give you is you don't have to try
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.760]   to pick a biotech or a utility stock or whatever. They will give you exposure to that. And it's
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.980]   hard to believe, but there will be extended periods of time where those technology stocks
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.720]   that you're big in are not doing well and other areas of the stock market are. So Core
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.520]   and Explore, Ben, I think is the right suggestion here.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.280]   And to your point about performance, this is a good way to track your performance, too,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.980]   to say, "Here's what my index fund is doing. Is all this time and effort and work really
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.320]   even giving me anything in a performance, or can I just set it and forget it eventually?"
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.360]   And if the answer is yes, it is, and you're crushing the index, then the next thing you
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.200]   want to do is immediately start charging your relatives two and twenty and launching your
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:04.080]   fund. All right, dude, you're 17 years old. You're way ahead of all your friends. Keep
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   going. Don't worry about anything. You're doing fine.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.240]   All right, Duncan, last question.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.960]   Great job, Bennett. Okay, up next we have a question from Sam. And so Sam asks, "Is
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.280]   there any way of telling" – this is kind of like searching for the Fountain of Youth,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.360]   but I like this question – "Is there any way of telling when a stock has probably hit
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.920]   its peak, if not for good, for a long, long time? For example, GE hit an all-time peak
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.360]   back in the year 2000, and since then, it's been a long decline. What are some signs an
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.040]   investor can look for that a stock has probably gotten as high as it's ever going to get?"
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.760]   Let's do a chart on GE here.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.200]   I want to hear Ben's answer on this.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   All right, I got some stuff. I'm backing up. So this is GE. It hit a high of around
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   $480 in 2000. It's now at about $96. We're talking 80% decline in value.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   Gross.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.080]   And this is the stock that was – and how many retirees' portfolios that worked at
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.160]   GE, because this is a huge company. So my way of thinking about this, it's easier
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.260]   to pick losers in the stock market than winners in some ways. So, John, let's do the next
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.260]   chart on.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.080]   So if you've been following our content for any period of time, you've heard us mention
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.360]   this agony and ecstasy findings from JP Morgan. I think I first included this in my book,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.160]   which came out in 2015, maybe, '14, and they've updated it since then. They just
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.000]   updated it through 2020. This shows that the number of companies in the S&P 500 having
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:24.520]   a catastrophic loss from 1980 to 2020 is 44% of all stocks. Catastrophic loss.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   What percent of all stocks?
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   44%.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   Two-thirds of the time –
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.080]   44% of stocks would have – wait. What is a catastrophic loss?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.360]   That's basically you lose and you're not coming back.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.780]   Oh, like endgame loss. Okay.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.880]   So they show you the companies that are removed for distress. They said around two-thirds
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.040]   of the time, every single stock in the Russell 3000, which is the whole stock market, underperforms
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.760]   the actual index. And only 10% of stocks since 1980 are what they consider mega-winners.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.280]   So those are the names, Amazon and Apple and Google.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.720]   So I'm not saying people should go open a short fund to short all these stocks, but
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.480]   it's easier to be part of the losers than it is to be part of the winners. But they
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.380]   gave the reason. So JP Morgan said, "Well, why does this happen?" And a lot of times
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.480]   they said, "It's not just companies being inept and not understanding what's going
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.840]   on. It's a lot of times it's commodity prices that you have no control over, regulation
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   from government, deregulation, foreign competitors and globalization, maybe intellectual property
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.660]   infringement from other countries, trade policies, and then, of course, technological innovation
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.920]   is the biggest one."
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.480]   So there are reasons beyond just saying, "Oh, the CEO is dumb. They didn't see it coming."
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   So I would love to hear your answer here because I think this is really hard.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.280]   I was going to say obsolescence is the big one in my mind. I don't know if that's
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.640]   the reason for most of these, but like when I try to think of examples of companies that
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.560]   never come back, that's the big one to me. But in the case of GE, it really was management
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.360]   and not in the way that most people think. So a lot of people – obviously, Immelt gets
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.320]   most of the blame, the CEO. He had been there a long time and almost every decision he made
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.520]   was the worst possible decision you could have made. There's a great book on the fall
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.680]   of GE. I've read a couple of the chapters for researching something. I didn't read
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.920]   the whole book, but it was really good and it gets into not only was Immelt disastrous,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.240]   making a huge energy acquisition at the top of the oil market and doing all sorts of things
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   that looked bad at the time and turned out even worse, but he inherited a situation where
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:35.240]   the guy before him was aggressively managing earnings, like using the finance arm of the
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   company –
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   Do you think that they could do that today?
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   To pull money out of the cookie jar? No way.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.440]   Like the way that they massaged the earnings numbers, right? They could do that today,
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   right?
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:50.880]   No. This is pre-Sarbanes-Oxley, pre-Twitter, pre-activist short sellers putting people
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.040]   on blast on social media. I don't think that you could have cookie jarred your way
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.080]   – using GE finance to just anytime you were short a few pennies in earnings, just pull
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   some money out of there and drop it to your bottom line. I don't think that you could
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.240]   get away with that with the modern SEC and Department of Justice, the tools they have
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.200]   to analyze. So it's a really good question.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.400]   Now if you're a shareholder in GE, you don't really know what's going on, right? There
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:27.600]   is no social media. People aren't gossiping about Jack Welch all day on Twitter. This
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.120]   predates all of that. But GE is definitely a case – and then Immelt steps in and he
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.320]   can't do those magic tricks. So already, he starts disappointing.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.240]   Here's the crazy thing about GE. I looked at this. They were in the top 10 holdings
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:49.440]   of the S&P 500 every year from 1980 to 2005. So betting that they would fall probably seemed
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.360]   like there's no way this is going to happen. Of course this is going to go back. So I think
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.440]   I've posed this question to Michael before. Take the top 10 today. What is the company
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.000]   most at risk potentially of falling out even though we don't know what the reason is
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   going to be?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.880]   Is Facebook the easiest one?
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.200]   Well, where is the top 10? How do I get to the top 10 on Y charts? What page do I go
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   to?
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.880]   Type in SPY and go to holdings.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:20.000]   Yeah, right. Facebook is the one that would make me the most nervous of that risk to be
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   honest with you.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Whether it's competition with the government?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Like that obsolescence risk.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.560]   Berkshire Hathaway is in there? Is that a Warren Buffett risk where they could somehow
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.400]   fall off the map?
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.000]   Well, the consensus on Berkshire Hathaway for the last 10 years is the day he dies,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.200]   that stock falls by 40%. I'm going to go the other way. I think the knee jerk is down 15%
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.000]   and then within six months, they're dismantling the company, spinning things off, creating
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   shareholder value.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Bill Ackman comes in, yeah.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.640]   That stock goes crazy. I think it's possible that Buffett's presence is tamping down on
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.800]   the potential of Berkshire. They have $180 billion in cash. They have no idea what to
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   do with it. They're in their 90s. They're in their 90s. So I don't think that's the
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.200]   bigger risk in that group.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:16.720]   Let me say this. Put back that GE thing for a sec, the chart. We didn't create this with
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.400]   moving averages or any of that shit. But one good way to keep yourself out of a stock that
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:29.920]   has the potential to do this is to think about monthly charts and monthly moving averages.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.600]   So if you were to do a monthly chart of GE and overlay that with a 200-period moving
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   average, in this case it would be a 200-month moving average, if this stock starts to close
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:49.920]   below that very, very, very long-term monthly moving average and it's in a defined downtrend
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.280]   on that basis, you're definitely not going to be able to get out at the top because it's
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.000]   already falling.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.520]   But that might be an indication that something has materially changed in the trend for a
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.080]   stock. So I'm not suggesting that would save you 100% of the potential loss. But if you
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:13.520]   had sold GE 30% off the top and your rationale is this thing is now in a long-term downtrend
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.800]   and I no longer believe that this is as good of a stock as it used to be, that's not the
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.120]   most rigorous intellectual argument, but it would have saved you a ton of money.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.600]   So think about monthly charting just as a way to get a better idea of the more important
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:38.520]   trend. Anything shorter than that, weekly, daily, hourly, is too noisy. I think there's
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   a lot of signal in a monthly chart for an individual stock. So that would be my one
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.480]   suggestion to try to avoid catastrophe.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.380]   It's easier in predicting what's going to happen in the future with technology or some
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:55.720]   other outside force that's going to cause. But my point is just that you have way better
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.100]   odds of picking a mega-loser than a mega-winner, unfortunately, in the stock market.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.880]   It's amazing that that's true because we forget about the mega-losers.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.880]   Yeah, it's a survivorship bias.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:14.040]   Once they disappear, they're no longer readily available to us in our memory banks. Enron
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.480]   stands out and Lehman stands out because of how catastrophic it was. But there have been
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.560]   thousands of companies that have filed for bankruptcy. We just don't care about them
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.720]   anymore. You're 100% right about that. So there's definitely an availability bias at
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   work against us remembering that.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.740]   All right. If you in the comments here have an idea, what's the next top 10 S&P 500 company
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.720]   that's going to go down? Leave it in the comments. I'll take a look at them.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   That's a great show.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   Great questions today.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:48.040]   This is your show, but can we give a couple of shout-outs to the live stream? I saw some
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.880]   really great stuff while we were talking. Ken Havens, when we were talking about the
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.000]   top five stocks in the kids' portfolio, the challenge is going to be finding the next
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.040]   NVIDIA AMD. The 20 baggers, these names were 20 years already in the making. That's really
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.920]   a great point. They're not going to do what they've already done unless they're all Tesla.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.160]   This guy, Peter Georges, the moment I go all in is a pretty good indicator the stock peaked.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   Let's leave it there.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.420]   That's a good one.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.640]   That's fire. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Ken, for hanging out with us today. All right, Ben,
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.000]   your show. You wrap it up.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.720]   Yep. Thank you, Josh. If you have a question, email us at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.400]   Remember, Duncan and I are checking all those. I'm a big fan of round numbers. So we want
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.440]   to get to 100,000 subscribers this year. So hit that subscribe button if you haven't yet.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   We want to get there. idontshop.com. I think you can still order some stuff and get it
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.880]   in time for holidays here.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   Hell yeah.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.920]   And we will see you next week. Thank you.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.040]   Thanks, everyone.
