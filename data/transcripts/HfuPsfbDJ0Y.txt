[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   I think the main myth, especially for people who haven't traveled overseas, is a big misconception
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.240]   that U.S. has the very best healthcare, and we do.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.600]   But in order to take advantage of that healthcare, a significant number of people, mostly at
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.920]   the bottom of the pyramid or toward the middle of the pyramid economically, can't afford
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   it.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   We've priced ourselves out of the market.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320]   So we don't universally have great healthcare.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   We're like everywhere else.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.980]   What people really don't know is that healthcare is as good or better overseas, cross borders,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.840]   than they can get here in the United States.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.360]   And the conception there is anyone who hasn't traveled overseas can't imagine a Four Seasons
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.200]   or a Hilton or a Denny's or a J.Crew or a Costco.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   All of those exist in almost every city in the world now.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   And yet people who can't conceptualize that, who can't get their arms around that, are
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   not going to be able to get their arms around being on an operating table or a dental treatment
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.960]   chair in a mind-blowingly advanced hygienic environment.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.520]   They just can't see that happening.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.320]   What they see is a mud hut, rusty scalpels, and weird doctors that don't know English.
