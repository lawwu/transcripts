[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Well, good morning.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, thank you both of you. Good morning.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   Oh, that's much better.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.120]   You're awake now.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.120]   It's good to see you after a very busy evening.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   You guys are the die-hards that are back.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.840]   So, up early and ready to go.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.240]   Of course, this is the session which I know your wife drug you
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.280]   to because it's about the husbands and this is usually
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.040]   the session where the women themselves take copious notes.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   So, this is probably what's going to happen here today anyhow.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.680]   Let me see if I can get this up straight.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.280]   Okay, good. So, we want to jump right into God's design for husbands.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.880]   What is the role? The Bible clearly outlines.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.600]   You know, I'm afraid that I have had the opportunity over the last 40,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.400]   45 years to counsel a lot of people in a variety of different churches,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.720]   variety of different settings, and it's amazing.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   Even from churches that are very solid Bible-believing,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.800]   Bible-teaching churches, how unclear this is in men's minds.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.400]   One of my things here is to make it very clear.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.120]   I want to make this very memorable.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.360]   I want you to be able to walk away and you
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520]   don't even have to have a Bible in your hand.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.960]   All you have to think about is some really key principles there
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.360]   to just see how you're doing in order to be a godly husband.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.960]   So, this is really key.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.920]   In order to get started here,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.880]   remember how we said last night,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.240]   Romans chapter 12, verse 9,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.840]   the whole theme of the conference is,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   somebody asked you at the end of this weekend, what did you do?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.520]   I went to a marriage conference and I learned how to hate more.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.840]   I learned how to hate my own sin more.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.360]   That's exactly what Romans 12, 9 talks about.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.680]   Let love be genuine,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   abhor or hate what is evil,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.640]   and cling to that which is good.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:10.600]   So, I realize areas in my life as a husband or as a wife that I am violating God's word in,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.160]   I've got to learn to turn all my negative emotions on
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.480]   that violation and learn to hate that about myself,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.080]   and learn to cling to that which is good.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   That's what I need to do.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.880]   That's really important, and this is what we need to do today here as well.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.200]   For husbands, we're going to talk about three key areas to help you to
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.000]   remember your role as a godly husband,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.760]   and I just want you to use them,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.600]   put them in the back pocket of your memory,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   and pull them out every now and then say,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   "How am I doing? How am I doing?"
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   I'm not going to share these so that wives can hold you to these standards.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.800]   I'm sharing this so that you will hold yourself to this standard.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.640]   So, this is really important.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.160]   Even though your wife may keep copious notes on this,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.760]   it's not her job to be your personal Holy Spirit.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.960]   You already have one to convict you of sin,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   righteousness, and judgment, and she's not the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.760]   She never will be, and it's not her job to do that,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.680]   to remind you of all the areas where you're doing things wrong.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.640]   No, no, no. You have a Holy Spirit.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.720]   The Holy Spirit will do a whole bunch better job than she'll ever do.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.000]   So, it's not her job to do that kind of thing.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.680]   Now, take your Bible.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   If you don't have a Bible near you,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.280]   look on somebody who's close by. You need to see this.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.760]   Let's go back to Genesis 3.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.080]   Remember, we went back to Genesis last night,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.640]   and we talked a little bit about what did God set as the standard for family,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.920]   for marriage, we talked about the purpose of marriage being that of companionship,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.480]   and that's the very thing that really suffers
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   when a marriage gets into trouble is the issue of companionship.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   Well, we're going to drop in to Genesis 3 now.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840]   After the fall has occurred,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.440]   Adam and Eve have sinned,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.400]   God has brought the curse upon them,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.040]   and in bringing the curse,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.880]   first he talks to the serpent,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.080]   then he talks to the woman,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.480]   then he talks to the man,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   but in between the man and woman's curse,
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.160]   there's a transitional statement there.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.840]   It says in verse 16 to the woman he said,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.600]   "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.760]   in pain you shall bring for children."
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.400]   Now, I want you to think about that for a moment,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.000]   because we're going to come back to that a little bit later on the last session that we
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.320]   do and explain that and flush that out a little bit more fully.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.400]   But then he says, and here's the transitional phrase,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.640]   "Your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you."
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.080]   Now, the question now comes,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.840]   what does that mean?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.760]   I cannot tell you how many trees have died producing
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.480]   paper to make books explaining what that meant down through history.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.120]   There are all kinds of commentaries on this particular thing.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.180]   What does it mean when it says,
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.000]   "Your desire," he says to the woman,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.240]   "shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you."
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.680]   All kinds of theories are put out there.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.840]   Now, one of the best hermeneutical rules,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.400]   I teach hermeneutics and advanced hermeneutics in our graduate program.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.960]   This is just principles of biblical interpretation.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.920]   One of the best things you can remember is a text without a context is a pretext for
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.240]   a proof text. A text without a context is a pretext for a proof text.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.680]   That's always important in relationship to biblical understanding.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.920]   If you don't understand things within context,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.040]   within the way in which that author has stated something,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.560]   then you really don't understand what's going on.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.320]   Now, you hate it when somebody takes you out of context, right?
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   All right, you just hate that.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.640]   I used an illustration back 2002,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.680]   after the 9/11 and the towers came down.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.040]   There's a story told real not far from here on a Shoney's,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.600]   on Alligator Alley where a waitress overheard
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.480]   a couple of Muslim students talking about bringing it down in Miami,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.840]   and she called the police.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.960]   The police descended on them and arrested these two Muslim students and so on,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.600]   and it turned out they weren't talking about bringing buildings down,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.000]   they were talking about bringing money down to Miami.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.880]   So, it turned out to be the wrong thing.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.800]   So, they were totally taken out of context,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.960]   and you hate it when you're taken out of context.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.480]   You imagine how God feels when you take his word out of context, all right?
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.280]   You take it, you misuse it,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.080]   and you use it for your own purposes.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.040]   You don't use it the way God intended it.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.760]   What does he think about that?
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.240]   That's why we say a text without a context is a pretext for proof text.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.000]   That's why we say that. That's really important.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.360]   You can't take things out of context.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.960]   So, what does this mean within context?
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.080]   That's the key question.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Well, one of the best ways to tell that,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.320]   is you go to the next closest place where that same author uses the same word,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.240]   in this particular case, the same Hebrew word,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.840]   and see how he used it in that sense,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.800]   and then we can put it back into this,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.300]   and probably be pretty sure that that's what he meant here.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.880]   Now, so the next time our author, in this case,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.560]   Moses, uses this particular word,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.800]   is Genesis chapter 4.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.960]   If you go over to Genesis chapter 4,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.880]   in verse 7, it says,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   God is talking to Cain and says,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.320]   "If you do well, will you not be accepted?"
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.000]   Or really, literally, the Hebrew says,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.120]   "Will not your face be lifted up?"
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   Because there's always joy and obedience.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.040]   "But if you do not do well,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.280]   sin is crouching at the door.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.660]   It's desire."
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.500]   There's our same word. See that word, desire?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.020]   "It's desire is for you,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.500]   but you must master it."
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.320]   Now, it's very clear what he means here.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.700]   That is, sin is waiting at the door of Cain's life,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.420]   and if Cain goes through that door,
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.900]   it desires, almost like a wild animal,
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.220]   to jump on him, and master him,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.380]   and control him, and manipulate him, is the idea.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.480]   So, desire, in this particular case,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.520]   is a lust for control,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.700]   a lust for desire,
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.360]   or desire for control.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.160]   Now, if you take that meaning,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   plug that back in to 3.16,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.080]   then all of a sudden, we get
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.140]   a little bit clearer understanding.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.400]   Her desire is a result of the curse.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.200]   Since Eve walked out in front of
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   her husband and did this thing with the serpent,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.520]   then her husband followed her,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.280]   which is exactly the reverse of
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.980]   what God intended to happen.
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.220]   She's going to follow the natural consequences
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.960]   of her sin, is the idea.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.600]   Your desire, in this particular case,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.200]   that is, your desire to
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.440]   control and manipulate your husband,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.640]   and his desire will be to rule over you.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.160]   The word for rule there is
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.500]   a very heavy word that means despotic rule.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.760]   So, her desire is to
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.400]   control and manipulate her husband.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.040]   His desire is to rule.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.780]   So, the husband and wife relationship
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.220]   under the curse becomes
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.180]   a game of king of the hill, all right?
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.020]   She wants to control and manipulate him,
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.100]   he wants to dominate and rule over her.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.740]   So now, under the curse,
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.540]   marriage becomes a constant conflict.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.540]   Now, even ungodly marriages can live in
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.940]   a relatively peaceful environment,
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.860]   but that's only a sustained truce.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.460]   That's all that is.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.020]   It's not the true intimacy and
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.020]   companionship that God
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.580]   intended in genuine marriage.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.900]   That's not it at all.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.740]   Doesn't even come close to it.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.660]   But the idea here is,
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.820]   her desire is to control and manipulate her husband.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.980]   His desire is to rule over her and dominate her,
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.180]   and so now marriage becomes a struggle.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.460]   Even Christian marriages, to some extent,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.020]   manifest that particular struggle.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.500]   Sometimes the fruit or the results of
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.540]   that curse begins to
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.060]   occur even in the Christian marriage.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.340]   My wife sometimes when she
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.060]   does women's seminars, she'll say this.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.300]   She says, "I have never,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.780]   ever counseled a woman where she didn't have,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   either overtly or covertly,
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.700]   wanted to control and manipulate
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.220]   what her husband did in her heart."
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.260]   That's what she wants.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.580]   She wants him to turn out a certain way,
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.060]   and I've never met a guy in
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.180]   counseling that didn't have in some way,
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.500]   either overtly or covertly,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.180]   trying to control and manipulate
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.020]   and keep his thumb on his wife,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.220]   and so you've got this struggle where they were
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.820]   supposed to work together and compliment each other.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.300]   Now, under the curse,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.700]   marriage becomes, instead of a compliment, a conflict.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.500]   Marriage becomes a conflict.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.820]   It becomes a difficulty,
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.100]   a strife, if you will.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.060]   There's the implication.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.340]   Now, you're beginning to see why we have problems,
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.180]   why there are so many difficulties that go on,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.540]   even in the Christian marriage.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.220]   Now, in order to help you see this,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.460]   there's a little comic strip.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.340]   I remember finding this several years ago,
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.100]   and I kept it, and I had to put it up here.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:23.420]   It says here, "I have a great idea," the wife says.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.740]   "Let's reverse things.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.780]   Today, you be grouchy at church and charming at home."
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.660]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.180]   Today, I want you to be grouchy at church and charming at home.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.660]   You go to church and all of a sudden,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.740]   you turn on the charm and everybody sees it.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.460]   Gentlemen, is that the way you are?
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.700]   At home, you're a grouch.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.500]   You're a horrible person to live with.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.940]   Then you get at church and oh my goodness,
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.980]   you're the most wonderful guy in the world,
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.620]   and you care about everybody,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.860]   and now everything's going so well.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.780]   That's not the way it should be.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.580]   Never ever should it be that way. No way.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.340]   So, here are some introductory concerns here.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.860]   Number one, what is the nature of man's leadership in the home?
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.420]   What are we talking about here?
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.500]   In order to help you to understand this,
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.540]   I want you to grab your Bible for a moment,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.100]   and go over to Matthew chapter 20.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.420]   Matthew chapter 20.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.260]   In order to understand a man's leadership in the home,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.660]   Jesus talks about leadership here.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.780]   He talks about how leadership is radically
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.260]   different than the way in which the world defines leadership.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.660]   It is radically different, all right?
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.820]   Doesn't even come close to the world.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.500]   In fact, it's an antithetical
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.660]   to what the world's definition of leadership is.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.660]   You read all these books in business and stuff,
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.740]   and how to be a good leader,
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.620]   and you think about just about what the exact opposite of that is,
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.580]   you'll probably be pretty close to what the Bible says about it.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.980]   All right, you don't even have to know the Bible.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.300]   Just think about what the opposite is, all right?
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.780]   What is it?
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.380]   Well, notice this.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.700]   Jesus defines leadership in verse 25.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.060]   He says, "But Jesus called them to him and said,
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.460]   'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.660]   and their great ones exercise authority over them.'"
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.260]   Now, look at that very carefully.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.220]   In fact, the world's concept of leadership
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.500]   is to use heavy-handed authority over people,
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.860]   to lord it over people.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.380]   It's a top-down view of leadership.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.700]   You do what I say because I'm in control.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.700]   I control this in your life and that in your life,
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.220]   and you got to do what I say.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.900]   Jesus says that's the way the world has functioned
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.380]   ever since sin came into the world,
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.340]   ever since the curse.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.220]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.700]   To lord it over them.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.500]   But then look at verse 26.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.300]   "It shall not be so among you."
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.940]   He's talking to all Christians here.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.740]   He's reaching across the ages and talking to you.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.500]   "It shall not be so among you,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.860]   but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant."
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.780]   And here he uses the word diakonos,
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.460]   which is where we get our English word deacon from,
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.740]   which actually means to be a table waiter.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.460]   If you want to be a leader in my kingdom,
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.580]   you're going to be a table waiter.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.860]   Is the idea.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.380]   And whoever, verse 27 says,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.860]   "Would be first among you must be your slave."
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.220]   Now he changes Greek terms.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.140]   He goes to the term doulos.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.700]   Slave here means third-level galley slave
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.140]   on those big warships.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.260]   This is the same word that was used.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.380]   The hottest, worst level was the third level,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.860]   rowing in the galley in the hot, beastly hot,
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.900]   and hour after hour, your whole day,
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.660]   this is all you're doing.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.500]   That's a doulos.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.300]   Whoever is going to be first among you
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.060]   must first be a third-level galley slave?
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.420]   What in the world?
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.180]   Oh my goodness, that is just the opposite
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.460]   of what I think in terms of leadership.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.300]   That's not what I'm thinking at all.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.820]   Even as the Son of Man, verse 28 says,
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.340]   "Came not to be saved," or not to be served,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.260]   "but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.900]   That's the idea.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.940]   So it's not lording it over people.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.660]   That's not true leadership.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.820]   God never intended that.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.540]   Not among God's people.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.960]   It's not exercising top-down authority over people.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.120]   It's working from the bottom up.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.820]   That's true leadership.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.940]   That is being willing to assume
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.860]   the most difficult roles in the home
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.980]   and working from the bottom up,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.540]   and then everybody in the home is supposed to follow,
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.820]   and we'll see how that flushes itself out
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.420]   in terms of the Christian home a little bit later.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.280]   So what does God expect of a husband?
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.220]   God expects him, whether he's leading or not,
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.820]   God holds him accountable for leading.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.540]   You will be held accountable if you're a husband someday,
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.820]   and you stand before Jesus Christ.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.300]   He will hold you accountable
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.460]   for how you are leading your home.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.020]   Someday, you're gonna be there.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.140]   I'm gonna be there.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.560]   That's my responsibility.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.860]   That's your responsibility as a husband.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.020]   What does God expect of you?
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.660]   And how is the husband's role viewed
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.760]   in our society and culture?
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.380]   Well, we've already talked about the fact
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.540]   that in our culture, the home and marriage
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.640]   is under such a heavy attack.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.700]   Many men command a business, an organization.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.340]   They command things in the military.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.140]   They command things even at church oftentimes,
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.540]   but they've abdicated the throne of responsibility
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.540]   in leading the home.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.700]   They've forsaken it.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.740]   This is not what God ever intended at all.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.840]   In fact, what is the condition of your home?
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.820]   What is the condition of your home?
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.900]   If you were to step back and take an honest look
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.540]   at your leadership within your home,
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.300]   what is the condition of your home?
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.980]   Can you say that it matches what Jesus talks about
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.780]   in Matthew chapter 20, verses 25 through 28?
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.780]   Is this what is going on in your home?
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.580]   This is really key.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.300]   Well, you say, okay, I understand.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.700]   All right, I need help.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.720]   Help me here.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.340]   What does the Bible say I should be doing?
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.360]   Okay, I'm glad you asked that question.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.420]   Let me see if I can answer that question
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.300]   as clearly as possible.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.580]   In order to do that, there's three terms
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.100]   I want you to learn today.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.420]   We're gonna learn things, and I know your wife thinks
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.160]   it's impossible for you to learn anything new,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.220]   but you're gonna prove her wrong, okay?
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.240]   You're going to learn something new today, all right?
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.080]   Take your Bible.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.860]   Let's go over to 1 Peter chapter three.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.860]   1 Peter chapter three, and we're interested,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.080]   and we're gonna pick up in verse seven.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.860]   Let me explain real quickly a little bit
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.660]   about the background of 1 Peter.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.540]   1 Peter was written to Christians
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.460]   undergoing severe persecution.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.300]   It was during the time when Nero was emperor of Rome,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.500]   and Nero persecuted Christians.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.940]   In fact, I'm gonna come back to this
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.780]   and talk about this briefly again
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.260]   when we talk to the women about their leadership,
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.660]   or I mean about their role in terms of the home.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.660]   But the Roman emperor Nero was a wicked man.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.780]   He was a wicked man.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.340]   To give you an illustration of that,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.720]   if you go to Italy today, you can see some of the remains
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   of the palace areas where Nero actually lived and worked,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.740]   but factual history tells us that he had huge palaces
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.780]   and huge gardens, and around the palaces
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.220]   and gardens was a shanty town.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.220]   Shanty town, it was all wood.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.460]   Lots of poor people tried to get close
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.620]   to the really rich people sort of to gain the,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.620]   at that particular time, in this case, the emperor,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.240]   gain the crumbs off of his table.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.740]   Whatever he would cast out,
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.020]   they would consider to be something great.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.140]   And so whoever was thrown out of the palace,
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.540]   so around Emperor Nero's palaces
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.740]   was this wooden shanty town.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.900]   And Nero wanted to enlarge his palaces.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.620]   He wanted to become greater,
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.860]   but Roman law wouldn't permit him to claim that land
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.740]   because all the poor people around the palaces
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.040]   owned that land.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.580]   And so what he did was, in the middle of the night,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.780]   he sent out a bunch of henchmen with lidded torches,
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.340]   and they burned down the shanty town.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.900]   Thousands upon thousands of people died in that.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.580]   In fact, archeologists will tell you
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.140]   that there's a layer of ash there in Rome
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.300]   that shows where all of this was burned down.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.880]   And then, after he burned it all down,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.620]   then he blamed it on all the Christians.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.540]   He blamed it on the Christians.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.140]   The Christians are the one who did it.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.660]   When Nero was the one who did it,
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.660]   so he could claim their land and build bigger palaces.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.940]   All right, that's what he wanted to do.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.220]   And he hated Christians.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.580]   In fact, we have historical accounts of the fact
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.740]   that he fed Christians to wild dogs,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.060]   he covered them with tar,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.100]   and mounted them on posts up in the air,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.620]   tied, and then lit them on fire while still alive
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.980]   just to light his gardens.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.060]   He burned them at the stake.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.900]   He crucified them.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.180]   And it's within that context that 1 Peter,
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.620]   that the apostle Peter, is writing to the Christians.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.540]   Now, you think you've gone through a hard time?
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.780]   I don't think you've gone through anything
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.500]   like these Christians are going through, all right?
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.480]   And so, what do you do if you live in a world
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.420]   where everybody in the unbelieving world
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.900]   believes that you've done wicked things
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.260]   and you've done nothing wrong?
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.240]   Everybody believes.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.580]   And by the way, our culture and our society right now
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.780]   is heading quickly in that direction,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.680]   where all the Christians are,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.140]   instead of being good anymore,
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.320]   are now going to be viewed as bad.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.500]   They're going to be falsely accused.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.660]   So how do you handle that?
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.260]   1 Peter's going to become more and more prevalent
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.400]   among Christians in reading 1 Peter
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.200]   in dealing with a wicked world who falsely accuses them.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.540]   And so, in the midst of this,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.460]   he's talking to husband and wives.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.620]   In chapter three, verses one through six,
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.620]   he talks to Christian women married to unbelieving husbands.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.220]   And these husbands sometimes may even be
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.900]   professing Christians, but they're acting like unbelievers.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.660]   And then in 1 Peter 3, seven,
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.300]   he's talking to Christian husbands
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.700]   married to unbelieving wives, okay?
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.420]   So, what does he say in verse seven?
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.620]   Look at this, gentlemen.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.120]   Likewise, husbands, live with your wives
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.820]   in an understanding way,
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.400]   showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.320]   since, or it'd be better to translate this word as,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.700]   they are heirs with you of the grace of life
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.100]   so that your prayers will not be hindered.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.620]   In other words, the context says
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.300]   that these women are unbelievers,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.180]   they're very difficult to live with,
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.780]   they're making their Christian husbands' lives miserable,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.940]   and he talks to them, these husbands,
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.540]   as saying you are to treat her
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.260]   as you would a Christian wife,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.940]   as an heir with you of the grace of life,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.140]   is the implication.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.120]   So, what is he saying here?
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.740]   All right, the first thing you need to remember
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.180]   in order to be a godly husband,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.500]   we learn from this particular verse.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.940]   In order to be a godly husband,
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.340]   you have got to be a learner.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.600]   That's really key.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.180]   In order to be a godly husband,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.940]   you've got to be a learner.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.420]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.100]   Well, when you look at this verse carefully,
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.260]   it says live with your wives in an understanding way.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.060]   I really don't like that English translation,
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.960]   living in an understanding way,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.000]   because when you tell a guy
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.860]   you're supposed to be understanding with your wife,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.820]   he'll say, oh, pfft, I understand her.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.340]   After all, she's a woman.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.420]   I mean, pfft, I understand her.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.180]   It's almost a dismissive thing.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.260]   That's not at all what he means here.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.420]   In fact, the term that's used here
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.820]   is a term to dwell together with her,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   it's a soon compound Greek word,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.620]   dwell together with her knowledgeably.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.700]   Gnosis is the term.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   That is with conscious sensitivity.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.340]   That's a very deliberate word.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.260]   It's where we get the word gnostic from.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.740]   Gnostics believe that they had a higher knowledge.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.060]   Well, in this particular case,
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.020]   you're supposed to dwell with your unbelieving wife
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.380]   on a higher level of knowledge.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.220]   You're supposed to dwell with her
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.760]   with a very special conscious sensitivity,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.300]   not just understanding that she's a woman.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.820]   We're talking about being knowledgeable about her.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.340]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.460]   Really knowing her, that's what we're talking about here.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.900]   So the implication is that the world,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.980]   when you say women, the world will throw their arms
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.180]   up in the air and say, ah, who can understand women?
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.580]   After all, they're like satellites in orbit.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.180]   You can't get a fix on them.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.980]   One day, they're on top of the world.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.180]   The next day, they're down in the depression.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.520]   The next day, they're on top of the world.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.140]   The next day, they're down in depression.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.860]   They live on the basis of their feelings.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.220]   Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.100]   That's what the world says.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.720]   But the Bible says the opposite.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.260]   The biblical implication requires time.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.260]   You cannot know your wife without spending time with her.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.800]   You've got to spend time.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.460]   And I always get the question in counseling.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:37.460]   Well, Dr. Shree, is that quantity of time?
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.280]   Is that quality time?
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.460]   I don't know.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.980]   Some men are slow learners, so it's got to be quantity.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.220]   All right.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.900]   Others, it's quality time.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.900]   Whatever the case may be, you cannot know her
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.460]   until you spend time with her.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.900]   Now, I've counseled a lot of mixed marriages
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.220]   where you have a Christian husband married
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.380]   to an unbelieving wife.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.980]   And in fact, one notorious counseling case
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.060]   I had several years ago,
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.940]   the wife was an avowed anti-Christian feminist,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.420]   but she wanted to come to Christian counseling.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.860]   So, eh, fine, come on in.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.820]   All right.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.260]   So I can't counsel her
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.380]   because you can't counsel an unbeliever.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.660]   It's an impossibility.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.640]   You cannot counsel an unbeliever.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.320]   Why?
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.740]   Well, because if you did try to counsel them,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.380]   you may get them to obey the Bible,
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.660]   but you can only get them to obey the Bible externally.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.620]   So what have you really done?
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.060]   You've created a really good Pharisee.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.860]   They can never obey the Bible from the heart.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.700]   All right.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.060]   All counseling is pre-counseling
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   until the person comes to Christ.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.600]   You cannot counsel them with the word of God.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.300]   They have nothing inside of them
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.740]   that's going to be responsive to that truth.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.020]   What you have to do is evangelize them.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.860]   That's what you have to do.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.060]   So I said, well, you're welcome to come in counseling.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.900]   You're welcome to sit,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.980]   but I'm gonna work on your husband.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.980]   Fine.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.220]   He needs work.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.060]   All right.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.540]   So she came in and I began talking about
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.380]   her responsibility to know, and she liked this.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.460]   She's sitting there, she's going,
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.460]   "Wow, yeah, that's it.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.860]   "I want him to know me."
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.700]   That's right.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.060]   So in within every woman's heart,
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.420]   there is this desire for their husbands to know them.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   That's there.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.600]   I want him to know me.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.140]   He doesn't really know me.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.360]   It's not, this is not an admonition given to their mothers
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.700]   or their closest girlfriend.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.120]   This is an admonition that God gives the husband.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.880]   The husband has the responsibility to know her
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.520]   better than anyone else on the planet.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:43.520]   You are supposed to be God's resident expert on that woman
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.840]   and nobody else should know her any better than you do.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.580]   You've gotta be a learner of her.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.920]   Too many guys know how to command a huge business.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.680]   They know their business inside and out.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.480]   They don't have a clue what's going on
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.360]   in the life of their wife.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.880]   And so their whole life becomes another failure.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.040]   Even though from a secular point of view,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.280]   it looks like they're succeeding really well.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   But their life is a failure.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.880]   They don't know their wife.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.600]   Now, there's recently been a new book out
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.200]   on how to understand women.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.860]   I don't know whether you've seen it in bookstores or not.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.040]   [congregation laughing]
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.880]   All right.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.060]   It's pretty extensive.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.300]   [laughing]
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.060]   The book on understanding women
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.980]   has finally arrived in bookstores, okay?
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.500]   So there it is.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.180]   No, actually, it's not quite as complicated as that at all.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.780]   I don't wanna give you that kind of an idea.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.580]   What are we talking about here?
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.620]   Well, the biblical implication
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.640]   requires that you study your wife.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.700]   There's the idea.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.760]   The biblical understanding, you study her.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.540]   How did God create women?
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.380]   What is unique about their gender?
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.100]   That's really key.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.620]   I mean, when you were growing up as a young boy,
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.940]   you didn't stand around in the kitchen
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.720]   listening to all the women tell horror stories
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.100]   about giving birth.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.760]   She probably did.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.760]   That's a whole different set of experiences and thoughts.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.260]   Oh my goodness, someday I may have to go through this.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.260]   How did God create them in their unique gender?
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.660]   This is really important.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.100]   A lot of men have not really given
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.660]   a whole lot of thought to that.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.360]   And yet the Bible says,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.220]   if you're gonna dwell with your wife,
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.820]   you've gotta dwell with her knowledgably.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.360]   You've gotta know her.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.080]   That involves knowing how God created women.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.220]   Then it talks about the fact
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.660]   that not only must you understand how God created women,
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.660]   but what about your wife?
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.720]   What is unique and special about her?
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.660]   What are her unique gifts and her unique abilities
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.820]   that's different from every other woman in the world?
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.460]   She's not the same as every other woman in the world.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.020]   So what is it that makes your wife,
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.080]   with her skillset and her abilities,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.140]   what is it that makes her unique?
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   She is a unique combination of skills
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.780]   and abilities and gifts,
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.220]   and most men have never given a whole lot of thought to that.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.980]   What is unique about your wife?
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.260]   And then what is your wife's particular load
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.860]   that she bears in life?
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.220]   What is unique to her struggles in life?
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.060]   How is she different in this way?
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.420]   Some women have grown up
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.020]   where they've come out of terrible homes
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.700]   where mom and dad were physically abusive,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.100]   or sometimes even sexually abusive,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.260]   or other members of the family where that was the case,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.000]   or they've grown up and they've had
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.360]   certain physical struggles all of their life,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.960]   and that makes unique.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.720]   That's a load that she bears in life,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.980]   or she has a mother or father or brother or sisters
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.500]   that do not know the Lord,
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.880]   and this is a burden on her heart.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.520]   That's a unique load that she bears in life.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.580]   So how is your wife unique in that way,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.260]   in her struggles in life,
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.440]   and how is she different in this way?
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.220]   The better you understand that,
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.380]   the better you will know your wife.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.900]   Sometimes in counseling,
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.060]   I have a list of 50 questions that are often given husbands,
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.820]   and I'll say, "Okay, between now
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.440]   "and the next counseling appointment that we have,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.840]   "I want you to take your wife out on a date.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.620]   "I want you to find a little restaurant
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.940]   "where you can get along,
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.520]   "where just the two of you are just set aside over there,
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.900]   "and I want you to interview her with these 50 questions,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.860]   "just like somebody from a television station
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.960]   "would come and interview her.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.940]   "I want you to interview her,
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.660]   "and I want you to write down all of her answers."
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.580]   Okay?
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.100]   And the first questions are pretty easy,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.120]   but when they get into them about,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.420]   we're getting down to 30, 31, 32, 33,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.980]   they start to get more and more difficult.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.040]   It requires a lot more thought,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:17.960]   and pretty soon she's saying,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.780]   "You know, I'm not sure what I really think about that.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.740]   "Let me think on it for a little bit."
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.760]   Now, I want him to show me that he did it,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.440]   but I'm not interested in what she said,
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.840]   because it's not my responsibility to know her.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.060]   I wanna make sure he did it.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.240]   That's it.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.020]   I wanna make sure he's interviewed her, he knows her.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.780]   That kind of primes the pump.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.820]   That gets him started thinking in those areas.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.320]   He probably knows his business really, really well.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   Now he's gotta know his wife even better than his business.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.800]   He's gotta know her better than her best friend knows her,
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   better than their oldest daughter knows her.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.560]   That's his job.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.480]   That's his responsibility.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   You're supposed to dwell with her knowledgeably.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.620]   This is important.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.900]   Why?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.860]   Why is it so important?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.400]   Well, you have to give attention to her
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.160]   as to a weaker vessel.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.880]   Now that does not mean, you'll notice here,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.480]   and I'm reading from the English Standard Version,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   here it says, "Showing honor with her as the weaker vessel."
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.640]   That doesn't mean she's necessarily physically weak.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.000]   That's not what it's referring to.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.960]   The word weaker really should be translated here, delicate.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.220]   And the word vessel is referenced to a clay pot.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   Back in the first century, clay pots were used.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.300]   When you go to the well, you'd fill a clay pot full of water
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.460]   and if you set it down too hard on a sharp stone or rock,
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.380]   it would crack the clay pot, so you had to be really careful.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.060]   When you filled it with water, it was very heavy
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.140]   to set it in a place where it wouldn't crack.
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.780]   And in this similar way, you had to treat it with delicacy.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.620]   This is exactly what needs to be done
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.300]   in regards to your wife.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.780]   Why?
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:15.780]   Because God says He's the one who sovereignly,
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.760]   in His goodness, gave her to you.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:25.420]   So you need to treat her as a special gift from Him,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.060]   as a delicate clay pot.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.940]   Let me use this as an illustration.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.220]   Let's say, for instance,
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.660]   some long-launched relative willed you, in their will,
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:46.120]   a fifth-century Ming vase worth millions.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.860]   Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.380]   All right?
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.580]   Now, if you wanted a picture for your living room
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.620]   or above your fireplace,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.020]   you do have fireplaces here in Florida, right?
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.020]   No fireplaces, okay, on your table.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   But if you wanted a vase and you went down to Walmart
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.740]   or Target or whatever your favorite, not Cracker Barrel,
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.660]   but wherever you buy vases,
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:24.180]   and you bought it, my guess would be you'd pay $25, $30
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.580]   for that vase, you'd check it out, throw it in a plastic bag,
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.940]   take it out, throw it in the backseat, take it home,
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.700]   put it up on the mantel, put some dried flowers in it,
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.280]   dust it off occasionally.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.620]   Now, if you inherited a fifth-century Ming vase,
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.100]   you wouldn't go collect it, throw it in a plastic bag,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.700]   pitch it in the backseat, take it home, sit it up,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.100]   put some dried flowers in it, dust it off occasionally.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.780]   No, you'd probably, now I know some of you guys are sitting,
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.340]   I'd sell it, and that ruins my whole illustration.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.540]   All right?
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:01.580]   No, you just had to keep it for a little while.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.340]   The value's going up.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.180]   All right?
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.340]   No, you'd probably hire Brink Security
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.460]   with an atmospherically-controlled vault
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.620]   that would pull up and get this thing,
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.640]   and you would strap it down on a nice, really soft pillow
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.060]   to make sure that it doesn't get damaged in transport,
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.620]   and you would lock it up in a,
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.540]   now, I'm not talking about locking your wife up in a vault,
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.940]   but you get the idea, you would treat it
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.620]   with extreme value, all right?
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.260]   Most guys don't treat their wives like that.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.060]   They don't treat their wives like fifth-century Ming vase,
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.640]   they treat 'em like Tupperware, all right?
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.860]   That's the way they treat their wives.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.100]   No, no, no, sitting next to you
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.180]   is your fifth-century Ming vase.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:58.180]   You are treated with respect as a delicate vase,
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.460]   as a piece of fine china, is the idea,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.420]   where you're not gonna throw it around and bump it around,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.340]   you're not gonna do any of that stuff.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.780]   No, no, no, this is your treasure.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.820]   That's what should be happening.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.500]   You're to give attention to her.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.740]   This means to honor her, respect her,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.140]   cherish her as you would an expensive piece of fine china.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.660]   She is to be treated with utmost value.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.960]   Hence the idea, listen to this,
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.300]   husbands, live with your wives in a knowledgeable way,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.260]   showing honor, the word there, honor,
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.260]   is respect to the woman as a delicate vase, is the idea.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:45.820]   And as she is, heirs with you of the gracious gift of life.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.520]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.420]   Are you treating your wife that way?
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.180]   Are you treating your wife that way?
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.860]   Treating her with respect, with honor?
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.940]   That's really important.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   Bible says you're failing, and you're failing miserably
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.100]   when you don't do that.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:16.500]   This has become maybe a major sinful issue in your life.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.140]   You're harsh, you're demanding,
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.900]   you're upset all the time at her,
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.340]   you're angry at her all the time.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.940]   You would not do that in relationship
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.420]   to something of extreme value in your life.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.460]   You would treasure it, you would protect it.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.080]   You treat her as if there is no value.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.700]   No, no, no, the Bible says God is the one
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.220]   who gave that precious gift to you,
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.660]   and it's up to you to treat that gift
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.960]   with the utmost lovable stewardship you can.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   Treat her with utmost respect as a fifth century Ming Voss
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.880]   worth millions and millions.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.460]   That is your responsibility.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.160]   Give honor to her.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.920]   And then it says this, your learning her
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.760]   affects your spiritual life.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.920]   Your learning her affects your spiritual life.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.000]   That means this, that her problems become your problems.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.560]   He says that in verse seven.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   He says, "As heirs with you the gracious gift of life
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:34.840]   "so that your prayers will not be hindered," he says.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.080]   Godly husbands don't say she made the mess,
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.440]   she'll just have to take care of it herself.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.920]   Godly husbands don't say that.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.480]   All of my wife's problems are my problems,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.080]   but not all of my problems are her problems.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   All of my wife's problems are my problems
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.160]   as part of leadership, every single one.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.600]   That's my responsibility.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.520]   So I'm not gonna demean her or try to act
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.600]   like she's making mountains out of molehills
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.560]   when she presents problems to me.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.900]   If it's a problem to her, then it is a problem to me.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.680]   That's really key.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.720]   I'm not gonna dismiss her, I'm not gonna act
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.960]   like it's trivial, I'm gonna do my best
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.800]   to address that problem.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.560]   Now, my wife knows that I cannot solve
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.800]   every problem in her life.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.680]   She knows that.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.600]   I'm not God, I can't do that, but just the fact
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.920]   that she knows that I'm interested in all the problems
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.020]   in her life makes the difference, you follow me?
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.880]   This is really important, the fact that she knows that.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.320]   So you're learning her.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.640]   If you ever wonder why your prayers
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.200]   are not getting any higher than the ceiling,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.680]   then you need to check your relationship to your wife.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.880]   God's not listening to me, you may say.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.760]   The first thing you do is you check your relationship
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.160]   with your wife so that your prayers
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.040]   will not be hindered, he says.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:08.240]   God says, listen, don't pretend to be spiritual
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.880]   and pray to me and treat your wife in an ungodly way.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.240]   I'm not gonna listen to you, God says.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.260]   I'm not gonna listen to your prayers.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.320]   I'm not interested in anything you have to say
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.680]   until you start treating your wife well.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.300]   That's pretty significant.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.460]   This is important.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:31.360]   So the second thing, by the way, take your Bible,
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.040]   let's go over to Ephesians chapter five.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.880]   The first thing you gotta remember is to be
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.400]   a godly husband, you gotta be a learner.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   The second thing is you need to be a Christ-like lover.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.520]   What are we talking about here?
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.080]   Ephesians chapter five, verse 25.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.800]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.260]   and gave himself up for her.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.060]   So I've gotta be a learner.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.720]   The second thing is I gotta be a lover, a Christ-like lover.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   Now, what is the love that a man is supposed to have
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.860]   for a woman because our American culture
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.080]   doesn't help us here at all.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.120]   The popular view of a man's love for a woman
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.740]   is a macho sexual conquest type of a love.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.640]   I'll show her I love her, I'll grab her and drag her to bed.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.480]   That's the way I show her I love her.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:16.180]   But that is not at all the way that God describes love.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.800]   Anyone can take from a woman,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.280]   but it takes a biblical man to give.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.640]   Let me give you an illustration of this.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.520]   When you see the word to give, or excuse me,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.440]   the word love in the New Testament,
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   it's usually accompanied with the action verb to give.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   God so loved the world that he gave, right?
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.760]   That's John chapter three, verse 16.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.560]   Galatians chapter two and verse 20.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   Christ loved us and gave himself up for us.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.400]   Ephesians 5:25, we just read this.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.100]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.920]   and gave himself up for her.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.160]   Biblical love does not take from a woman.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.680]   Biblical love gives to a woman.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.520]   There's a difference between the two.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.640]   So biblical love, I want to suggest to you,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.500]   is the real test of masculinity.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.440]   Because God-like love gives
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.320]   without expecting anything in return.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.760]   And by the way, God has so designed her life
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.200]   that when you are constantly giving to her,
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.080]   her heart is naturally responsive to that
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.400]   and want to be reciprocal in a similar way.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.980]   That's the way God designed that woman's heart.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.440]   But you are not doing it to get anything
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.400]   out of her or from her.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.680]   You're doing it because you're being God-like
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   in giving love, whether she reciprocates or not
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.000]   is not the issue.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.720]   You're doing it in a unilateral fashion.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.760]   That's really key.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.040]   Without any kind of expectations
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.480]   attached to that love at all.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   That's the real test of masculinity.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.520]   Why?
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.160]   Because we don't take from our wives.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.360]   We give to them, we give to them, we give to them.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.520]   That's what we do.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.840]   Everybody knows that little saying in our household,
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.880]   if mom ain't happy, ain't nobody happy, right?
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.160]   That's right, we know it.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.620]   She is the queen of our castle.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.880]   And I'm not the king, I'm her servant.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.400]   I want the kids to know that.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.320]   She's the queen.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.000]   Mama is the queen.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.920]   Even my grandkids know that.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.880]   She is.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.560]   That's the way it should be.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.120]   Now, what degrees should we show this kind of love?
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.020]   To what degree?
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.540]   Well, notice this.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.940]   That we're supposed to love as Christ loved.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.880]   That's what verse 25 says.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.560]   Well, how did he love?
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.760]   Well, look at this.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   One thing we know, 1 John 4, 19,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.520]   we love him because he what?
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.000]   First loved us, right?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.100]   So he was a first type lover.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.880]   We don't wait for our wives to love us.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.200]   We are the ones, as men, who initiate the love.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.780]   I'll never forget, several years ago,
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.880]   having a husband and wife come in.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.320]   They were having some pretty serious marital problems
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.160]   in counseling.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.200]   At one point in the counseling,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.600]   he sort of sat back in his chair and he folded his arm.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.000]   He says, "There's no love in this household."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.840]   And he kind of looked at her with a scathing look.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.400]   I'm going, "Whoa."
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   I wanted to pull out a mirror and stick it in his face
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.640]   and say, "Why not?"
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.340]   Because it's not her job.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.880]   It's his job.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   If we're gonna love as Christ loved,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.080]   we love him because he first loved us.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.880]   We're gonna be first type lovers.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   We're the ones that are going to initiate the love.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.520]   It's not her job to do that.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.960]   It's your job to do that.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.880]   We're gonna love as Christ loved.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.160]   Wow.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   Second thing, verse 25 of Ephesians says
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.640]   that Christ loved us and gave himself up for us.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.760]   So we're not just gonna love first.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.520]   We're gonna love most.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.160]   In other words, of the two, the husband and the wife,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.200]   you've gotta overwhelm her with your love
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.000]   instead of her overwhelming you with her love.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.560]   You need to overwhelm her with your love.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.960]   You're doing the most.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.160]   And then 1 John 3:18 talks about,
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.360]   "Let us not love in word, neither in tongue,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.320]   "but in deed and in truth."
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.580]   That means we don't just tell her that we love her.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.320]   I talk about this when I train men in pastoral ministry
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.980]   and we train counselors in our graduate program.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.080]   I talk about the fact that, listen,
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.760]   don't tell people that you're counseling,
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.720]   all right, Tom, I want you to go home this week
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.200]   and love Trudy.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.320]   You know what that means to Tom?
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.640]   That means he's gonna go home
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.480]   and he's gonna sit down in his easy chair
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.080]   and emote love towards her.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:13.260]   Okay, I love Trudy this week.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.840]   Let us not love in word, neither in tongue,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.600]   but in deed and in truth.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.960]   That means not falsely, but truthfully,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.360]   not with a fake or facade.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.840]   Genuinely, she's gotta see it in the deeds that we do.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.720]   So if we're gonna love as Christ loved,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.520]   we're gonna love first, we're gonna love most,
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.920]   and we're gonna love unmistakably.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.760]   Those three things.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.040]   If we're gonna love as Christ loved,
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.920]   we're gonna love first, we're gonna love most,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.540]   we're gonna love unmistakably.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.240]   That's the way Christ loved.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.500]   Now notice this.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.880]   Now, gentlemen, you really do need a fastener seatbelt,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.280]   put your crash helmets on,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.320]   and you may wanna add a flak vest to it now, all right?
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.480]   Are you ready?
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.800]   Look at Ephesians 5 now.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.720]   Drop down to verse 28.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.800]   In the same way.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.620]   Now in what way?
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.280]   In the way that Christ loved us.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.880]   So we're not supposed to just love them as Christ,
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.480]   we're supposed to love them as our own bodies.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.960]   What does that mean?
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.480]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say we hate ourselves.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.780]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.800]   we love ourselves too little.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.560]   The Bible is constantly replete with the idea,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.900]   and all that comes out of psychology,
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.340]   and has been adopted into a lot of Christian psychology
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.300]   to get day.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.740]   That's not biblical at all.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.260]   The Bible is replete with warnings
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.440]   that we love ourselves way too much.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.380]   I mean, some of you guys love yourself really good.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.580]   I mean, I can tell.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.420]   I watched some of you back there
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.440]   with those rolls and donuts.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.620]   All right?
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.020]   You are loving on yourself, man.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.860]   You do really, when you're hurt, what do you do?
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.540]   You bandage yourself when you're thirsty.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.740]   You get something to drink when you're hungry.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.340]   You get something to eat.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.320]   You do, when you're cold, you make sure that you're warm.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.260]   By the way, I understand here in South Florida,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.580]   cold is 80 degree weather.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.380]   So when you're warm, you make sure you get cool.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.420]   All right?
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.340]   So you take really good care of your,
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.900]   if you took as good a care of your wife
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.140]   as you do of yourself, you'd have a great marriage.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.700]   The Bible actually assumes
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.980]   that husbands already love themselves a lot.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.020]   It assumes that.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.820]   This is what Jesus said, by the way, as well.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.420]   Matthew 19, when he says,
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.380]   the Pharisees confronted him
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.380]   about what's the greatest commandment in the law,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.420]   and Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.660]   "with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.660]   "and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.900]   Jesus was not saying you need to love yourself.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:02.500]   Jesus was saying you need to love your neighbor
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.160]   as passionately as you already love yourself.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.500]   You're supposed to love God
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.860]   as passionately as you already love yourself.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.680]   Why?
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.520]   Because in the very next verse,
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.060]   he says, "Upon these two commands," not three,
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.260]   "these two commands, the entire law hangs."
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.080]   What does that?
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.180]   How much we love God and how much we love other people.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.860]   The Bible actually assumes we love ourselves an awful lot,
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:25.020]   and if we loved ourselves less and loved other people more,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.380]   we'd have great relationships.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.380]   Husbands need to love their wives more
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.780]   than the natural tendency to love self.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.720]   That's the idea.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.080]   This is such a key thing.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.920]   Why?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.740]   Well, because this is the kind of love
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.940]   that overcomes bitterness.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.640]   Colossians chapter three and verse 19 says this.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.300]   "Husbands, love your wives
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.480]   "and do not be harsh or embittered with them."
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.440]   The way the Greek construction of that sentence implies
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.400]   that when you're genuinely loving your wife,
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.860]   it's impossible for you to hold on to bitterness towards her.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.600]   I know that because in counseling,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   I've had a lot of men say to me,
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.840]   "Well, you don't understand.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.680]   "My wife has a sharp tongue.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.940]   "She can slice you and dice you with it."
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.840]   All right?
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.660]   She has a sharp tongue.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.640]   For years, this is what she's done in our marriage.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.960]   (vocalizing)
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.760]   And usually, women are better verbally than men are,
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.880]   and so they go after their husbands verbally,
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.840]   and then the husbands react physically,
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.540]   and they get, "Oh, oh, what has happened here?
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.380]   "I don't understand.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.200]   "What has happened?"
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.800]   It's because, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.760]   what has happened.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.960]   And so, but he's held onto this bitterness
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.220]   in his heart for a long, long time.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.780]   He's held onto this, and he refuses not to be bitter,
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.640]   and I explained to him, "Now, listen.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.820]   "Imagine for a moment I have two large horses,
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.480]   "one on this side going that direction,
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.140]   "one on that side going that direction,
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.180]   "and you got a hold of both of their tails.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.420]   "One horse on this side is bitterness.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.900]   "The other horse on this side is love,
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.300]   "and God says, 'Giddy up!'"
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:09.040]   At some particular point, you're gonna have to choose
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.380]   which one to let go of.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.300]   You cannot hold onto your bitterness,
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.780]   and at the same time, hold onto your love for her.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.640]   You can't do that.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.680]   Now, hopefully, you're going to let go of your bitterness,
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.320]   and you're gonna hold onto your love for her.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   It is this kind of love that overcomes bitterness.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.100]   Well, you don't know what my wife has done.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.620]   Yeah, I don't know what your wife has done in the past.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.260]   Maybe she's done some wicked things.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.420]   Maybe she's done some bad things.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.020]   But this is where a forgiving, loving heart
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.860]   makes all the difference in the world
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.660]   and can return sweetness to your marriage.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.160]   You've gotta determine to do it,
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.480]   and the ball is in your court as a husband to do that.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   It's in your court.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.920]   This is really important.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.140]   So the first thing you gotta remember
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.040]   is you gotta be a learner.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.460]   The second thing you gotta remember
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.220]   is be a Christlike lover.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.260]   But the third thing, let's go back to Ephesians 5,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.400]   pick up in verse 23, where it says,
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.740]   "For the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.460]   "he is in Christ, is the head of the church,
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.580]   "his body, and he himself is the Savior.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.140]   "Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.060]   "so also wives should submit in everything
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.300]   "to their husbands."
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.620]   The third thing is this.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.740]   In order to be a godly husband, you gotta be a leader.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.300]   Let me explain what leadership is not,
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.180]   and then I'll talk about what it is.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.860]   I talked a little bit before about the fact
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.980]   that what leadership was not
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.020]   when we went over to Matthew chapter 20
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.660]   at the very beginning.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.760]   Leadership is not being a dictator.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.880]   That's not leadership, not in God's place.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.440]   It's not where you're dictating things to your wife.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.360]   It's not where you're dominating your wife.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.880]   Too many men think that they must make
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.680]   all the decisions in their marriage,
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.260]   and that is not true.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.920]   That implies that somehow God made a mistake
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.760]   by giving your wife a brain.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.360]   He should've given you an automaton for a wife
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.020]   instead of a wife.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.120]   No, no, no, your wife has a brain.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.960]   You need her input.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.320]   She has a feminine view of life that you don't have,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.240]   and my wife's feminine view has helped me enormously
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.080]   in ministry.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.680]   If you don't take advantage of that, you're a fool.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   I remember after, when I was a pastor years ago,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.920]   and I used to preach on Sunday morning,
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.160]   I'd be standing, talking to people afterwards,
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.560]   and they'd come by and make comments about the sermon
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.400]   or what's going on in their lives, stuff.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.120]   So my wife and I and kids would drive home
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   for lunch on Sunday afternoon, and my wife would say,
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.960]   "By the way, did you remember a Mr. and Mrs. Jones
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.880]   "coming up to you and saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da?"
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.480]   I'd say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do remember that.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.280]   "Do you know what Mrs. Jones was saying
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.120]   "when she said da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da?"
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.680]   I said, "Sure, Mrs. Jones was saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.160]   She said, "No, that's not what she was saying."
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:01.380]   I made the mistake of taking Mrs. Jones at her word,
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.220]   all right?
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:09.180]   There were subtle things in between there, all right?
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.540]   And she says, "Mrs. Jones was saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.300]   Really?
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.740]   That's what Mrs. Jones was saying?
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:19.820]   Yes.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.580]   Ugh.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.700]   All right, I see Mrs. Jones later on that evening,
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.660]   the Sunday evening service.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.180]   I say, "Mrs. Jones, this morning when you came up
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:57.180]   and you said, "Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh," did you mean, "Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:05.420]   that you have special, you can have input into people's lives if you listen to her,
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.180]   meaningful input.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.260]   So a lot of men who don't take advantage of that.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.180]   And then a guy leader's not demanding, he doesn't force her to submit, nowhere in the
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:18.740]   Bible, nowhere in the Bible does it ever say that it's a husband's job to make sure his
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:19.740]   wife submits.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.020]   Nowhere in the Bible does it say that.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:24.460]   And by the way, you couldn't do that anyhow.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.180]   You may make her obey because you're bigger, physically stronger.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.500]   You may make her obey, but you can't force her to submit because submission is always
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.280]   an attitude of the heart.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   You can't do that.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.780]   You cannot force submission, nobody can force submission on anybody.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.160]   You can't do that.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:48.900]   It's something that she has to decide in her heart before God to do, and you make it either
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.060]   easy or hard.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:57.660]   Let's make it, ha, I got an idea, easy.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.540]   Let's make it easy for her to do this.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.020]   That is revolutionary.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.420]   All right?
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:10.260]   A godly leader is not demanding, he does not force her to submit.
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.260]   What is godly leadership?
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:18.340]   I love John 10:27 because it says, "My sheep hear my voice and they follow me."
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.700]   All right?
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:25.020]   Jesus did not get behind the sheep with a bullwhip and drive them to where He wanted
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   them to go.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.020]   He didn't do that.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.020]   Jesus didn't do that.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:33.820]   In other words, He got out in front, and by the behavior of His life, they followed His
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.820]   model.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.620]   "My sheep hear my voice, they follow me."
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.100]   That is godly leadership.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:48.060]   So how are your wife and children, how are you leading them?
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.580]   If you're going to be a leader, you've got to focus on needs.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.580]   That is the needs of others.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.380]   You're going to put their needs above your own needs.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.300]   You're going to be very goal-oriented, and by setting godly goals, where do you want
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.420]   to be in five years of your marriage, 10 years of your marriage, 15 years of your marriage,
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.420]   where do you want to be?
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.660]   You've got to set godly goals in order to attain them.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:11.140]   You've got to set examples of control in every area of your life.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:17.300]   How much you watch TV, how much you read, what you watch on TV, where you go on the
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:25.020]   internet, how you use your smartphone, and where you go on the internet with your smartphone.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.020]   Everybody's watching you.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.380]   Your wife and your kids are watching you.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:35.220]   You're setting examples of purity and godliness by everything you do or don't do.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.220]   This is so key.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:42.620]   Where do you want to take them spiritually?
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.820]   You're leading them in the Word of God, in prayer.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.220]   Where are you?
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.220]   Set examples of control.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.940]   You're a problem solver.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:54.520]   She knows that she can turn to you for help.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.520]   She knows that.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.140]   And you're a teacher.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:03.900]   You lead her in the Word, and you're a joy to live with.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.420]   You know how many husbands are not joys to live with?
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.900]   I mean, this comes out of years.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.740]   That whole principle comes out of years of counseling.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.980]   Why?
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:18.540]   Because I know that some husbands, when they come home from work, six o'clock in the evening,
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.620]   the wife and the kids are running for cover, because he walks in the door, and he's a grouch.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.580]   He's biting everybody's head off.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.980]   I never wanted that in my home.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.980]   I never wanted...
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.580]   You know, I had my share of problems.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:34.840]   In fact, I've listened to people's problems for 45 years, all right?
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.260]   I don't want to just have my own problems.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.220]   I'd listen to everybody else's problems.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:44.780]   And I never wanted to come home, and I never, ever wanted to bring those problems home.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:49.620]   You know, when I turned the corner to our little subdivision, I left all my problems
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.940]   right there in that corner.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:57.740]   Next morning, I went by and picked them back up and went back to work.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:03.580]   But I wanted my wife and kids to say, just before I got home, "Ten minutes, Dad's going
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.380]   to be home.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.300]   Best time of the day."
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.940]   I didn't want them running for cover.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.180]   You've got to be a joy to live with.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:25.460]   Are you a joy, or are you a pain where we cannot explain to live with?
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.460]   What are you?
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.460]   What are you?
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.740]   Three things you've got to remember in order to be a godly husband, learner, lover, leader.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.820]   Let me tell you a quick story.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.780]   Years ago, premarital counseling, I was talking.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:44.180]   Tim Jennings and Brenda Casho, they were getting married, and I was talking about his responsibility
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.180]   as a future husband, taught him you've got to be a learner, lover, leader.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.180]   Those three things you've got to remember.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.740]   And on the day of your wedding, I'm going to ask you before you get married, what do
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.340]   you need to do, remember, in order to get married to Brenda?
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.860]   Tim says, "Okay, I'll have them."
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.860]   No problem.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.140]   The day of the wedding, showed up, went in and had prayer with the bride and her family.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.660]   Then I went ahead and had prayer with the groom, his family.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:10.460]   I said, "Tim, three things you've got to remember in order to be a godly husband to Brenda.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.460]   What are they?"
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:18.260]   He said, "I've got them, learner, lover, and lever."
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.780]   This wedding's off.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.300]   No, no, no.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.460]   Not learner, lover, lever.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.260]   Learner, lover, leader.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.580]   Learner, lover, leader.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.860]   Now, I want you to put those in the back pocket of your memory.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.300]   Now, gentlemen, look at me.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.260]   Don't look at your wife's notes.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.260]   Look at me.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.780]   All right, say it out loud to me.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   Ready?
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.380]   In order to be a godly husband, I am going to be a...uh-huh.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.380]   Uh-huh.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.060]   Oh, listen to that, ladies.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.580]   They got to memorize.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.180]   One more time, gentlemen, just to let it sink in.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.180]   Ready?
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.180]   In order to be a godly husband, I'm going to be a...uh-huh.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.180]   Uh-huh.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.540]   Oh, yes.
