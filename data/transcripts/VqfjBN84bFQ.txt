[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Someone wants to go to Italy
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.880]   and it's impossible to see it all,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.440]   but nobody or most people don't have 10 weeks,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.040]   you know, a year to go spend in Italy,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.360]   which I'm sure if they did, you would highly recommend,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.520]   but maybe they've got a week or two
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.720]   and they're like, I want to go see Italy.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.040]   I want to experience what you're talking about.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200]   How would you suggest they start to approach it?
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.920]   Or what are a few different approaches?
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.260]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.520]   So I think the first thing to realize
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920]   and understand is that no approach is the right approach.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920]   There are so many different ways of seeing Italy
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.080]   and so many different,
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.880]   you look at it as like a matrix, right?
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.280]   All the different cities, all the different sites,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000]   all the different reasons for visiting, right?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.920]   And you could go just see museums
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.080]   and be busy for 10 days in Rome alone, right?
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.440]   Or you could do the Rome, Venice, Florence,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   you know, Milan tour of all the museums
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.360]   or all the churches and historical sites
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.760]   and still not see all of the highlights
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.440]   that you can see in 10 days.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560]   So I think knowing that you're going into it,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.920]   leaving a lot on the table,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100]   leaving things to come back and visit in the future is great.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.320]   The second idea is knowing that
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.880]   it's really easy to burn out on too much eating,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.840]   too much museuming, too much churching
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.480]   as you go to Italy, right?
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.080]   And so building a nice mix in an itinerary
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.520]   is a really important thing to do.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.360]   So where do I find inspiration?
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.560]   You know, there's a lot of really great media right now
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.200]   that focuses on an aspect of Italian culture or life.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.400]   You know, Stanley Tucci has been doing
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.720]   for the past two years, his sort of Tour d'Italia,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160]   and he's going to all 20 regions
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.240]   and he's eating his way through.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.080]   And if you look at the way
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.360]   that he's approached his episodes,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.720]   these hour-long sort of opus, you know,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.280]   these hour-long bits of love to Lazio, where Rome is,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.500]   or, you know, Campania, where they grow the tomatoes
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.120]   that become your pizza tomatoes here in the States,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   you look at him really getting to know a people
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.100]   and a culture and a place,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.640]   something that he's very familiar with already,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.720]   but through the lens of food and people
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.360]   or food and culture.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.880]   And that's a wonderful approach for people to take
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300]   is they find some angle that they love,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.680]   whether it's in a book or a TV series,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840]   and they say, "Hey, I want to go recreate
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   "an element of that on my trip."
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   So I want to go to the place where, you know,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.920]   Stanley Tucci finds the tomato in the field of San Marzano
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   and says, "Okay, I found the real tomato.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.920]   "Now I know what it's supposed to taste like."
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.760]   And that's a centerpiece for their trip, right?
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   But there are so many blogs that are out there.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.160]   There's so many travel advisors willing to help.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   There's so many books you can read
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.480]   about everything to eat, see, and do in Italy.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   My biggest takeaway for people again is take your time
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.440]   and know that you're not going to see it all.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.940]   You're not going to do it all.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.280]   And you're going to have an amazing time in the process
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.640]   of whatever you do, see, and do.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240]   - So I feel like I'm both more excited to go to Italy
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   and I have no idea what I should do
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.120]   with a week and a trip.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240]   So maybe give some options.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.520]   I'm thinking one to two weeks,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.280]   maybe let's throw out two or three things
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.760]   that you might send someone to.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.600]   - Yeah.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   - Is Rome a must include on any first trip to Italy?
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.480]   - In my opinion, yes.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.840]   All roads lead to Rome for good reason, right?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.040]   Look, it's the third most visited city in all of Europe.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.520]   To me, it is a place that is happy and fun
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.920]   and lively and young and still so very old,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.320]   full of incredible cuisine,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.520]   full of some of the best historical sites in the world.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.680]   Look, to me, the fact that they could build the Pantheon,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.400]   this concrete domed roof with an open hole
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.480]   in the oculus in the center 2,000 years ago,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.960]   and it's still standing.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.200]   It's still standing, it's like mind-blowing.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   Like we can't build things here.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.600]   We can't build a road here.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   They can build a, 2,000 years ago,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.860]   a dome that is in the center of town that is remarkable.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.820]   And so when you see that,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.240]   you have this sense of awe that returns to you,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   whether you've been there 40 times
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.000]   or this is the first, right?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.600]   So I think Rome is absolutely an incredible place to go.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.800]   And go, go see the sites.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.860]   Go see the touristy sites that are overcrowded,
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.600]   the Colosseum, Vatican,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.400]   because they really are monuments to humanity
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.360]   and to an incredible society
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.040]   that has built and upkept these buildings for 2,000 years.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.400]   But also get lost.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.740]   Go off the beaten path in Rome
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.200]   and don't just go to the fancy gelateria
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.640]   across from the Trevi Fountain.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.240]   It's beautiful, it's great for Instagram,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.480]   but go wind through the streets of Trastevere,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.400]   across the river where the Romans live
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.820]   and the Romans go eat,
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.720]   and explore that little village
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.000]   and see what it's like to be in a little borgo,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.560]   a little village inside of a big metropolitan city.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.720]   Have a meal on a piazza
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.080]   where maybe you're the only person
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.200]   who doesn't speak fluent Italian.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.320]   That's okay.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.520]   You're gonna be welcomed in.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.380]   You're gonna eat an incredible meal,
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.040]   and you're gonna see the way that the dolce farniente,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.640]   the sweetness of doing nothing,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.920]   passes by in front of you on passeggiata
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.000]   as people are walking from the cafe
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.680]   to their restaurant, to their home, and beyond.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.880]   - Okay, that's Rome.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.720]   - That's Rome.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.680]   - Okay, so let's say I wanna do Rome and something else.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.660]   What are a few options?
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.920]   - Well, from Rome, if you draw a big circle,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.620]   you say, "I wanna take a two-hour train ride from Rome,"
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.000]   you've got a ton of options, North and South.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.820]   Traditionally, people would go South to the Amalfi Coast.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.660]   It's incredible.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.480]   It's iconic.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.660]   It's been made famous since movies in the '50s, right,
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.760]   where you're driving along these mountainside roads,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.880]   and there's a sheer cliff, 200, 500 feet down,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.400]   and beautiful beaches, and incredible food and wine.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.280]   That's amazing, it really is.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.640]   But Amalfi, the downside to it
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.960]   is that everyone wants to be there.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   So that coast between, let's say,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.720]   June and early September is a zoo.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   What is normally a 20-minute ride in a car or a bus
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.280]   could be an hour and a half stuck in traffic
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.240]   on a one-lane road.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.760]   That's a bummer when you're on a limited vacation time.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.040]   So what I would recommend is go to Amalfi,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   but maybe go in May or go in late September or October.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.920]   Weather is still amazing.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.240]   You can experience it, and that's wonderful.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.760]   So another piece to take away
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.200]   from the conversation is seasonality.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.400]   You can always go to Rome.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.520]   Rome is happening year-round.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.280]   It's harder to go to a beach in November,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.960]   but the Amalfi Coast in October is still really lovely,
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.340]   and you'll have a third of the crowds
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.640]   that are there throughout the year.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.360]   Nearby Amalfi, you've got Naples.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.480]   You've got Pompeii or Ercanuleo,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.600]   which is the nearby town that's like a mini Pompeii
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.000]   that has incredible ruins that are really not visited.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.840]   You can go walk amongst 2,000-year-old homes
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.080]   that were damaged in the ash from Vesuvius in 79 AD,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.760]   and you can just walk around and there's no one around you,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.960]   whereas in Pompeii, it can be pretty busy.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   So there's little alternatives to each place
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.400]   along the way that you should try to explore.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.520]   But if you don't want to go south, you can always go north.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.640]   Florence is only an hour and 20-minute train ride from Rome.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.800]   There's trains that leave every 15 minutes.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.960]   It's an incredible town.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.760]   It's like a medieval village that still comes alive today.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.840]   And I actually studied abroad there
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.260]   and did culinary school there in 2003.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.440]   Wow, that's a little while ago.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   And it was just an incredible place to be young,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.840]   to be alive, and to be living in a medieval city of today.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.480]   So great sights and sounds, amazing food.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.200]   If you like pork, that is your city.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.680]   If you like red wine, that is your region.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.520]   And there's a ton to do.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.680]   But let's say you've done Rome
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.280]   and you've done Florence before.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.920]   What do you do on your second or third trip back to Italy?
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.960]   Most of your flights are going to fly either into Rome
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.700]   or into Milan in the north.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.540]   That's where most of the flights
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.760]   from North America tend to land.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.800]   So what I like to do is get off the beaten path
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.440]   and explore other areas that are maybe less popular
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.660]   with North American tourists,
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.300]   but still, to me, pack authenticity, incredible food,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.640]   and great experiences into a small area.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.680]   So something to consider might be Umbria,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.740]   the green heart of Italy that's right next to Tuscany.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.980]   You have 2,000-year-old villages there,
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.100]   in fact, sometimes even older, to the Etruscan age.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.260]   You've got incredible food and wine,
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.860]   and you've got a third of the tourists that are in Tuscany.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.740]   And you're probably paying half
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.420]   to three quarters of the price as well.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.040]   So that's a wonderful place if you feel confident
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.460]   and you're okay to get off the beaten path
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.980]   by yourself, even if you don't speak Italian.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.160]   You can get by in Umbria, eat, drink, and see well,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.460]   and go see some incredible sights and sounds
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.900]   that are unlike anywhere else in the world.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.260]   The last plug I'll make for Umbria, by the way,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.260]   in May, May 15th, every year, my favorite festival
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.460]   in the whole world takes place.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.300]   It's called the Corsa di Ceri.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.220]   What that means is the running of the candles.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.460]   You think running of the candles,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.340]   how does that, candle blows out when you run?
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.260]   No, that doesn't work.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.900]   These crazy people in this town of Gubbio,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   they take these huge wooden slats.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.220]   They're like 30 feet long.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.900]   And a bunch of husky men hold onto them.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.940]   And on top of the slats are these big, tall columns
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.660]   with a saint on top.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.300]   And they run these columns of these candles
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.340]   through the town, through the medieval town.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.220]   And the, you know, the walls of the buildings next to you
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.660]   are like encroaching upon these candles
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.820]   as you run through the streets.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.860]   And they sing songs and they play trumpets and music.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.340]   And it's insane.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.780]   It's a party and no one outside of Italy goes there.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.900]   It's like, not like it's a running of the bulls
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.740]   or the Tomatera in Spain.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.980]   It's like this true Italian festival
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.500]   in the heart of Umbria.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.420]   And I've only been twice.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.140]   I would love to go back again because it's, to me,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.460]   it's the most exciting element of seeing people
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.460]   in their thing, doing their thing, living their lives,
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.460]   celebrating their history and culture
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.460]   and having a blast doing it.
