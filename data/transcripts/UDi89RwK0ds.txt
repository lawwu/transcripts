[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I'm Rick Ferry and I'm the president of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.360]   The Bogle Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization created in 2012 by the founders
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.000]   of the Bogleheads organization with the assistance of Jack Bogle.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.720]   The center's mission is to expand John Bogle's legacy by promoting the principles of successful
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   investing and financial well-being through education and community.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.580]   The website is boglecenter.net and your tax-deductible contributions are greatly appreciated.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.560]   Today is our fourth Boglehead Speaker Series live video event.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.040]   The idea for a live event came about after COVID-10 hit us and we had to cancel the 2020
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   Bogleheads conference, which is normally held in October.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.760]   For your planning purposes, the next Boglehead conference, live conference, in-person conference
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.100]   is going to be, we are planning for it to be in October of 2022 and we have not yet
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.640]   selected a location for the conference yet.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.780]   But in the meantime, we bring you this live speaker series.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.040]   And I wish to thank all the board members for their hard work in putting together this
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.080]   event and particularly to Mike Nolan, who was Jack's former assistant and a Bogle Center
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.520]   board member.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.800]   He's done a tremendous amount of work and his committee has done a tremendous amount
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.880]   of work to bring everything together.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.400]   We also would like to thank Vanguard for donating this venue that we're using and their time
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.460]   and the Vanguard people for being on board to help us with today's presentation.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.320]   Our presentation today is a popular one.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.800]   It is the expert panel that was stable at the Bogleheads conference in years past.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   We've had a expert panel every year since we started the conference.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.660]   Today our moderator for the conference is Karen Damato and we're very privileged to
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.560]   have Karen with us.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.000]   Her career spans more than 30 years.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.720]   She was a financial journalist and is now the content manager for a large Wall Street
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.760]   firm in New York.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.440]   Karen was a writer and editor of the Wall Street Journal for more than 30 years, where
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   her roles vary, including an editor overseeing monthly content, ETF reports, and the wealth
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.360]   educator portion of the site.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.920]   So with no further ado, I am going to turn it over to Karen, but we'll remind you that
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   today's event is being recorded and is going to be available on the Bogleheads site in
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   a few days.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.200]   So again, thanks again for joining us and Karen, please take it away.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.280]   Hello everyone.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.520]   Welcome to our panel today.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.320]   I know many of you know our esteemed panelists from the Bogleheads meetings, from their audio
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   podcasts, video appearances.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640]   We have Christine Benz.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   Christine is the director of personal finance for Morningstar and a senior columnist for
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.680]   Morningstar.com.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.480]   Bill Bernstein is a neurologist, co-founder of Efficient Frontier Advisors, and the author
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.760]   of several titles on finance and economic history.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.960]   Mike Piper is the CPA, author of several books as well, creator of the Open Social Security
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Calculator.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.320]   And Alan Roth is founder of financial planning firm WealthLogic, yet another prolific writer,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.600]   and he has also taught finance at the college level.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.720]   Thank you to so many of you who have sent in questions and suggestions for our conversation.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.520]   We're going to try and cover quite a few investing and personal finance topics.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.020]   I want to start with something that's been in the news recently, which was the crazy
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.840]   trading in GameStop, a stock that went from $20 to $483 in a couple of weeks, plummeted
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.360]   back to 50.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.920]   A lot of the trading was driven in conversations on social media.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.360]   And in an interesting coincidence of timing, Bill Bernstein has a new book coming out this
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.920]   month, The Delusions of Crowds.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.840]   So I think we'll start off here today, Bill, tell us what this whole GameStop thing was
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   about.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:49.920]   Well, what I would first say is to younger investors is to treat this as a history lesson.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.480]   Stand back and observe it from a distance and observe in particular how it's become
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.040]   topic A. Everywhere you go, people are talking about it.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   Observe how some people are quitting their jobs to trade in GameStop and other involved
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   securities.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.640]   Observe how people get the sense that investing is very easy if you do it right and that it's
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.320]   a path to rapid and effortless wealth.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.640]   And also observe how people are making extreme predictions about the price of GameStop and
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.840]   other targets so that the next time this occurs, you will have read the script, you will have
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.380]   seen the movie, and you know how it ends.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380]   Technically it's not very interesting.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.120]   It's a classic short squeeze, which I really don't want to waste a lot of time explaining.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.200]   You could look it up on Google, it was executed in an interesting way.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.880]   The only thing that I want to add is this is definitely not a case of the little guy
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.480]   sticking it to Wall Street, there's very little social justice here.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:09.160]   A few small players did get wealthy, but the big winners here are Robinhood, Citadel Securities,
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.320]   and the very large predator hedge funds that took Melvin Capital to the cleaners.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.400]   There is very little social justice here for the little person, and if you want to stick
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.040]   it to Wall Street, buy an index fund.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.320]   So Christine, you would say that the "stick it to the man" thing here, this is not unfamiliar
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.900]   to the Bogleheads, right?
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   Absolutely not.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:42.200]   As Bill said, Jack Bogle figured this out eons ago, where he figured out that by buying
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   an index fund, you are dramatically reducing the management fees that you're paying your
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.480]   investment firm, assuming you're buying and holding, you're taking your trading costs
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.400]   down close to zero, and so that has the effect of squeezing out Wall Street.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.160]   I think it's a more efficient way to do that over time, and it's a way that will be close
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.520]   to foolproof for you if you stick with it over many decades.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.480]   I did think it was funny that this "stick it to the man" narrative arose when I'm not
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.280]   sure that squeezing the shorts would be a way to do that with any sort of consistency.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Thank you.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   I think we'll move on toâ€”happily, we did not have a lot of questions about GameStop.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.200]   I say "happily" because hopefully that was a non-event for most of the Bogleheads and
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.160]   other people who are listening.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.280]   I want to start with one of the areas that we did get quite a few questions about, which
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.680]   is this extended period of low interest rates.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.600]   People of all ages, I think, are struggling with what they should do with the part of
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   their portfolio that they want to be in bonds or what they consider their safe money.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.560]   So, Alan, why don't you start us off on that?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   Sure.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.440]   You know, I've got to admit, when I look at rates today, I feel a lot of pain.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   It feels really, really bad.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.760]   But then I tell people to get real.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   And I go back to 1980 when we could earn 11.4 percent on a CD or bond fund, a high quality,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   which meant after taxes we got 7.5 percent, and inflation was at 13.5 percent then.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.980]   We lost 6 percent of our spending power, and that's what it's for, the portfolio.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:44.480]   But there are some good and some bad ways to try to earn a little bit more.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   You know, these are some solutions I've come up with people.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:54.840]   Number one, most stable value funds in 401(k)s and 403(b)s are yielding quite well.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.960]   And ironically, some of the absolute worst 401(k) plans issued by insurance companies
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.400]   have these stable value back when actuaries never dreamed that rates would be this low.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.240]   The TIA annuity, you have to look at each contract.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.560]   It's very, very different for each employer.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.960]   But most provide a 3 percent guaranteed return.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.520]   Some will require you to take the money out over a nine-year period, but some don't.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.840]   The TIA has a very high rating.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.960]   The Thrift Savings Plan G Fund is cash earning a whole lot more.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.900]   Direct CDs, these aren't brokered CDs, but CDs especially that have low early withdrawal
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.360]   penalties.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.800]   You know, an insured savings account by a bank or a credit union yielding 0.55 percent,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.720]   a whole lot better than a money market yielding 0.01 percent, where your money will double
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.840]   in 6,931 years.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.480]   And then there's the 900-pound gorilla, since the mortgage is the inverse of the bond, pay
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   down that mortgage.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.560]   So those are some good ways.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.240]   I've got a whole bunch of bad ways where you're going to lose principal, but you probably
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   don't need to hear those.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.760]   And Mike, what advice would you give for people who are thinking about what they should do
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   with their safer money?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.760]   Yeah, so I agree with things Alan said, suggestions are great.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:34.800]   I think a lot of times the answer here is not in adjusting your asset allocation necessarily,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.640]   but in looking at cash flow, by which I mean, if you're a good ways away from retirement,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   and so you're working on building up your retirement savings, you should probably just
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.000]   understand that you're not going to be getting the returns that we might have seen historically.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.060]   So you should be saving a little bit more.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.960]   And if you already are retired, or if you're about to retire, then similar sort of thing,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   it's just not likely that we're going to see returns that we've seen over a lot of historical
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   periods.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320]   And so planning to spend somewhat less is probably a good idea.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.640]   I know that's not great news, but that's kind of the reality.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   One of the specific questions we got from someone who's watching is about having CDs
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.840]   that are maturing, CDs that had been paying in the 2 to 3% range, renewal rates are now
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.160]   around 0.6%.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.120]   And so this individual is asking, well, is it better to perhaps put that money in an
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.480]   intermediate treasury fund?
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.120]   Another question might be, am I better off keeping it in the savings account and not
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.960]   even locking it up in a CD?
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.920]   I know, Alan, you use a lot of CDs.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.440]   So why don't you tell us what you think about that?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.000]   Yeah, I mean, I often opened up CDs that have easy early withdrawal penalties in case rates
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   rise.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.360]   But instead, I shed a tear when they mature, because I am earning less and less.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:05.920]   Now, I mean, just three weeks ago, I opened up a CD 1.25, 1.3%, you know, at a credit
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   union.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.520]   So there are still, you can shop for better rates and the like.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.160]   But absolutely, you know, do not take risks.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:22.000]   Do not do things like, you know, quote, safe dividend stocks like GE and the like.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.400]   So yeah, just keep the allocation the same.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.280]   I agree with Mike, as always, and try to find a higher rate that is safe.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.600]   Bank of Allen Roth, not FDIC insured, run, run fast.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   A couple of questions came in about bond funds, and specifically, a couple of questions, do
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:51.080]   you see concerns in continuing to use total bond market funds, given the continued stimulus
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   by the US government and potential for future inflation?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.720]   Would you recommend people consider other fixed income alternatives?
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.920]   Christine, you want to address that perhaps?
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   Sure.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.320]   I do think that investors need to remember that bonds are serving a couple of roles in
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.400]   your portfolio.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.960]   One is the income that they kick off, which we've been discussing is very, very low today.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.880]   And then the other role is as kind of a shock absorber for your equity exposure in your
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   portfolio.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:31.120]   So the thing that will hold its value, presumably in some sort of an equity market sell off.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.360]   And from that standpoint, I think bonds, high quality bonds, like you get with a total market
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.240]   index fund, will continue to serve that role.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.160]   We saw that during the first quarter of 2020, where there was a little bit of a bobble in
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   terms of principal values in the early part of that sell off, but by and large, high quality
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.680]   fixed income portfolios came through that period pretty well.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:03.480]   So I do think that investors shouldn't be disproportionately concerned about that relationship
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   changing.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.800]   I would note, though, there have been periods in market history where high quality bonds
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   were not the great diversifiers that we look upon them to be today.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.860]   So I think it's an open question with yields as low as they are, whether we might see some
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.600]   sort of change in that relationship going forward.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:29.160]   But I have to say it's when you think about assets that intuitively have a negative correlation
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.880]   with equities, I think the Treasury market really is it.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   So I am not overly concerned about investors having their fixed income exposure there.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   And I know you touched briefly on annuities before, separate from annuities that someone
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.480]   might find in a retirement plan.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   Do you think people who are looking for additional income, particularly retirees, should be going
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.800]   out and buying, considering buying immediate annuities or annuities that will start paying
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.600]   later in life?
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.160]   Potentially so, Karen.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.760]   I would say, though, and I'm going to ask Mike to tackle this, the best annuity that
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:19.440]   you can buy is to make sure that you're making smart choices with your Social Security and
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   Mike's whole calculator has been about helping people figure out when to claim Social Security.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.280]   So I'd start there.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.440]   But I have to say that annuities, the very simple, low cost kind, are a product where
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.080]   the more I've learned about them, the more I have become compelled by them.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.760]   And the reason is that, yes, their payouts are keyed off of the current interest rate
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.280]   environment, which puts some downward pressure on them.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.520]   But as an annuity buyer of a very basic annuity, you're obtaining what's called mortality risk
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:57.640]   pooling, which basically means that you're in the pool with other buyers and your payouts
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   are all enlarged by the fact that some of you will die sooner, some of you will live
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.560]   to be 105.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.080]   And so the person who does believe that he or she has longevity on their side will be
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.120]   a beneficiary of that mortality risk pooling.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.580]   If they do live a really long time, they'll get more than their fair share out of the
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580]   annuity.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.840]   But I do think that it's not for everyone, certainly for people with pensions, there's
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.200]   less a call for them to annuitize.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.120]   I think you'd want to be very careful with some of the more complicated annuity types
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.980]   like the variable annuities, certainly the fixed indexed annuities might have some attractions,
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.240]   but also very complicated, also more of an opportunity for the insurance company to embed
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.040]   costs in there.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.600]   But I do think that given low yields, it's a product that retirees specifically should
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.360]   be taking a look at.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.800]   But Mike, you want to tell people they should think about their social security plans before
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.120]   they go out and buy a standalone annuity?
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.360]   Yeah, it's definitely something you should be thinking about.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.220]   When you delay social security, what you're doing, you're giving up your benefits right
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.840]   now in exchange for a larger benefit later.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.480]   And economically, that's exactly the same thing as buying a lifetime annuity.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   Interestingly, you're buying an inflation-adjusted lifetime annuity, which used to be available
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   from insurance companies, but it no longer is as of, I guess, 2019.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   So coming up on two years ago.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.040]   So it's the only way you can buy an inflation-adjusted annuity these days.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:47.240]   And in most cases, for a single person, the payout rate that you would get from delaying
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   social security is considerably higher than what you would have been able to get from
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.080]   buying an annuity from an insurance company.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.560]   For the higher earner in a married couple, it's an even better deal.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.520]   Because when that person delays benefits, it increases the amount that the couple receives
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.960]   while either person is still alive.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.080]   But it's not as good of a deal for the lower earner in a married couple to delay.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.000]   Because when that person delays benefits, it only increases the amount that the couple
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.400]   receives while both people are still alive.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.860]   So the idea that delaying social security is a super, super good deal and everybody
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.960]   should do it, that's one of the exceptions.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.000]   For that person, it's not necessarily a bad deal, but it's not necessarily such a great
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   deal either.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Allen?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.080]   A SPIA, a Single Premium Immediate Annuity, is really the best of breed.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.960]   But think about it, if you buy an annuity yielding 5%, you have to live 20 years just
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.000]   to get your principal back.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.120]   And as Mike mentioned, you can no longer buy an inflation-adjusted annuity from an insurance
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.240]   company because they don't want to take that risk.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.080]   And if we end up having high inflation, not a prediction of possibility, boy, can you
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.600]   lose spending power.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   Phil?
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:12.780]   And I would just second or third or fourth that point and add that if you have to spend
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:19.160]   down almost every last dime in your retirement account to make it to age 70 so you can then
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.200]   collect social security, you should do so.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.040]   That's the best use of your retirement fund.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.000]   And then finally, I'll just give one more plug to Mike's site, OceanOpenSocialSecurity.com.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.320]   It is the single best social security calculator out there, and it is free.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.520]   Thank you.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:51.040]   While we're talking about inflation and inflation-adjusted annuities, how about TIPS, Treasury Inflation
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.520]   and Protected Securities?
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.320]   How do those look to you these days?
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.680]   You want to address that, Bill?
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:08.160]   Well, I was a fan a year or two ago, but right now at the short end, you're looking at real
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.960]   interest rates of something like minus 1.6 or minus 1.7%.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:20.840]   Even at the long end, you're getting a small but still negative real returns.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.600]   And it's just a function of lousy fixed income returns.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.960]   I mean, your original question, I think, had to do with intermediate treasuries.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   Well, the five-year treasury is yielding 50 basis points, 0.5%.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:43.680]   And I'm reminded every year of what that means when I read Warren Buffett's annual reports.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.760]   And there's usually a paragraph or two embedded in the report that talks about what a lousy
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.880]   deal treasury bills are.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.280]   The yields are low, you've got a negative real return, you're just not going to do very
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   well in them.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.440]   And then the last sentence in that paragraph always says, nonetheless, we will continue
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.920]   to hold the bulk of our liquid reserves in treasury bills.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.480]   And I think that summarizes it.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.520]   There are good reasons why you own treasury bills, and there will come a time when the
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.440]   treasury bills in your portfolio are going to look mighty good to you.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   OK.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.040]   So I think we'll move on from the frustrations in the stock and the frustrations on the cash
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.440]   and bond part of people's portfolios to the concerns that they have about the stock part
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.640]   of their portfolios and particularly high valuations.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:39.680]   We had a couple of questions specifically for you, Bill, about here we are a year into
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.760]   the pandemic, some very high stock market valuations.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.880]   People would like to hear your take on the risk of the market right now.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:56.040]   Well, this is a terrible thing to say, but the pandemic has been the best thing that
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.000]   ever happened to the stock market because it's precipitated Fed actions that have created
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   what some would call a bubble or more conservative people would just call very high stock market
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.600]   valuations.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.640]   And so the risk is really not so much that the pandemic will worsen.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.560]   Yes, if it does, that will hurt stock valuations and hurt stock prices.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.320]   The real risk is that the economy roars back, which I think is the most likely scenario.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.960]   And if that happens, interest rates will rise and that will not do good things for the stock
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   market.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.560]   So the risk is not that the pandemic gets worse.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   The risk to the stock investor is the pandemic gets better.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:48.400]   So with expanding the question a little bit, when we think about people who are frustrated
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.380]   by the low yields on bonds, but on the other hand, looking at high valuations in the stock
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:59.960]   market, how does that change your recommendations to people about their asset allocations?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:06.480]   Should they be pushing, shifting more money in one direction or the other or varying the
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.840]   kinds of stocks that they are holding?
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.880]   No, I mean, Mike's already answered that question very well, which is that the equity risk premium
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   really hasn't changed.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.320]   In other words, it used to be that you made 4 percent in bonds, let's say, and 8 percent
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   in stocks.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.520]   So you had an equity risk premium, the difference between those two of 4 percent.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.600]   Well, now, you know, those numbers look more like 1 percent and 5 percent, 1 percent on
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   bonds.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.600]   And that's a nominal return.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.460]   It's a negative real return and 5 percent on stocks.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.780]   So you're still earning the same risk premium.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.560]   So your allocation really shouldn't really shouldn't change.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.840]   Now, that's very different from the way things look, for example, in 2000, when, you know,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.120]   the stock expected stock returns probably look like 5 or 6 percent at best.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.480]   But you could earn that easily in bonds and that in that year would have, you know, canted
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.540]   you more towards towards bonds.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.640]   But I don't think that's that's that's not the case today.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.640]   Pretty much agreement on that on the panel or anyone feel differently, Alan?
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.520]   You know, I'm a pessimist by nature and if I always think the stock market is overvalued,
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.800]   I just try to ignore my my feelings.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.240]   And if we take a look back at last year, what happened to the economy?
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.200]   What happened to society?
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.280]   And then the fact that the stock market dumb data, a cap weighted index fund went up 21
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   percent.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.200]   Smart beta earned half that yet again.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.600]   So if we can't even explain the past, I try to ignore the feelings of whether I think
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.800]   the market is over or undervalued and stick to the plan, stick to the asset allocation
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   like is right yet again.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.080]   I like the idea of people using their life stage to decide how to approach this.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.720]   You know, I think the cohort that really needs to be concerned about a lofty equity market
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.080]   would be people who are approaching retirement, who have most of their assets and stocks.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.140]   And that's the group that I'm worried about, because we've come through a tremendous decade
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.140]   for stocks.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.920]   I think there's a fair amount of complacency even among seasoned investors with equity
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:30.400]   market risk, which is one reason I like to talk about building kind of a bulwark in your
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:37.120]   portfolio against equity market risk so that if you approach retirement, you're not having
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.880]   to draw upon the portion of your portfolio that has gone down.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.080]   So I like the idea of people at that life stage holding like 10 years worth of portfolio
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:54.040]   withdrawals in safer assets, whether cash, high quality bonds, things that should hold
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.520]   their value if equities go down and stay down for a good long time.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:06.000]   And then for younger investors, I would say they have less reason to build that bulwark.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.600]   They're not near near to their spending horizon.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.040]   So for them, I would say that the major thing that they might want to think about with asset
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.480]   allocation is just making sure that they're globally diversified.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.760]   Foreign stocks have been very hard to love over the past decade.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.800]   They've dramatically outperformed.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.520]   I think a total international index has returned like six percent annualized over the past
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520]   decade.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.780]   The total U.S. market has returned 14 percent.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.400]   So I think just making sure that they're fully globalized in terms of their equity exposure
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.040]   is a good starting point and they should hold as much equity exposure as they they think
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.320]   they can stand.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.840]   Thinking within, you talk about it's been hard to hold global stocks, non-U.S. stocks.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.480]   I guess there are people who would say the same thing about non-growth stocks on the
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.000]   value side of the spectrum.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.760]   I'd be curious what you would tell people about within their stock allocation.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:14.680]   Should they be tilting more towards gross value, varying by capitalization weights?
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   Potentially so.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.200]   I mean, I guess it depends on what their portfolio looks like.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:23.560]   If their portfolio is total market index exposure, I would say don't monkey with it.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   You're fine.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.400]   But for investors who do have discrete holdings in their portfolio where they have a value
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.720]   fund, they have a growth fund and you haven't looked at that recently, check it out because
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.160]   chances are your portfolio, if you've been hands off, has been skewing toward the growth
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.600]   side of the style box.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.280]   So you may want to do a little bit of rebalancing there because until very recently, we had
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.100]   been quite bifurcated in terms of value growth exposure.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:57.000]   Certainly over the past three or four years, growth has just throttled value.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.720]   And actually that relates to another question that came in, which is what is the best alternative
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   index fund to the Vanguard 500 index fund since the S&P 500 is now so top heavy with
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.520]   giant tech companies?
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.840]   So I would ask that as a two part question.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.960]   A, do you think that people should move away from the S&P 500 because of that top heaviness?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.760]   And if so, what are alternatives that people might look at?
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.800]   Yeah, I mean, I'll address that.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:37.080]   Less important than what your precise allocation is, whether you tilt towards value in small
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.240]   or you don't, whether you have more foreign or less foreign, that fades into insignificance
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.880]   when you when you when you compare to when you consider how good your discipline is.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:54.240]   So if, for example, you are a total stock market person, you are probably very happy
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:01.120]   right now and you may not be happy in five or 10 years, but that's fine, stick with your
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   asset allocation.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:08.760]   Conversely, if you're someone who has tilted towards value in small, you're very unhappy
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.000]   right now and probably the dumbest thing you can do right now if you're in that box is
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.360]   to abandon it.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:20.720]   If you happen to be in that category right now, I would point out that the spread between
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:29.360]   value and growth stocks is as large as it has ever been in history, even in the year
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   2000.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.080]   And so, again, it's less important what your precise allocation is than your ability to
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.360]   maintain your discipline and stick with that asset allocation through thick and thin.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   Alan?
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.800]   Yeah, just real quickly, I once wrote a article, The Case Against the S&P 500 Index Funding.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.160]   Got a note from Jack Vogel afterwards, but I was trying to argue that the total stock
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.680]   index fund, which he also brought us, was better.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:03.800]   And then I recently wrote a piece looking at the S&P 500 return last year, a mid-cap
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.200]   and a small cap.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.320]   How did those do versus the total market?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.600]   The total market beat all three, and there was one company that was the vast majority
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:19.120]   of the reason, and it was Tesla, which wasn't in any of the three until something like December
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.400]   14th, it got admitted to the 500.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.520]   So the total stock is better, which is still going to be a lot more heavily weighted towards
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   the Apples, Googles, etc., the FANG stocks.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.560]   But I'm not the market in the market.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.120]   Yeah, I never thought I'd see the day when people would start talking and talking up
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.400]   the Extended Market Index, which finally happened last year, which held Tesla until it had to
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:51.160]   let it go and put it in the S&P 500 at a rather high price.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:58.200]   A couple of classic Vogelhead allocation questions, so I want to just ask all four of you to respond
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   to these.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.920]   What's a reasonable portion of my stock holdings to be in non-US stocks?
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.960]   Well, we do it alphabetical, Christine.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.200]   I would say 25-30%, I think, is probably in the right ballpark.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.880]   I often refer to a paper that Vanguard's Chris Phillips did a number of years ago, where
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:27.040]   he looked at where home country bias is more hurtful, in what country of residence would
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.080]   you be most hurt by really sticking with your country's market.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.640]   Turns out the U.S. is one of the better markets to have a home country bias in that we have
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:44.600]   a super-diversified economy, whereas, say, Canada, for example, is so focused on the
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.080]   natural resources sector, bank stocks.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:54.360]   It tends to be much less diversified, so you don't need to be all in sort of looking at
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.400]   the global market cap to guide your U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:06.520]   With the U.S. market, you can sanely have the majority of your portfolio in U.S. stocks,
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.640]   but I would say a starting point would be like 25% to a third for most people.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   Okay.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   Bill?
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:19.120]   Well, if you look at it strictly from a market cap point of view, you should be 50-50.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.020]   But then there are reasons to tilt away from that, namely that your consumption is going
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.120]   to be in U.S. dollars.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   That's number one.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:33.000]   Number two, for a U.S. investor, foreign stocks, particularly in a tax-advantaged account,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.560]   have certain tax disadvantages having to do with the taxation of interest.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.880]   But on the other hand, foreign stocks are considerably less expensive than U.S. stocks.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.520]   So the neutral rating, as Christine suggests, is about 30%.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.280]   I wouldn't object if someone wanted 40% or even slightly north of that in foreign stocks
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   right now.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.560]   Again, less important than the exact number is just picking a number and sticking with
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.720]   it for a long, long time.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.760]   Just continuing around the crowd, Mike, what's your number?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   Same as what the other two have said.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.180]   I think it makes sense to start with market cap as like the beginning of your analysis,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:20.200]   but then there's good reasons to adjust somewhat towards U.S. currency risk, which is what
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   Bill was talking about.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.960]   There's also a slight difference in expenses, not dramatic by any means if we're talking
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.080]   about index funds, but international funds are slightly more expensive.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.660]   So it's also, by the way, not usually something that makes a dramatic difference.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:41.120]   If you're looking at 20% international versus 40% international, it's nowhere near as important
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.840]   as what percentage of the portfolio is in stocks overall, as opposed to in fixed income.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   Okay.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   Alan?
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:55.000]   I've been saying a third of one stock portfolio for a long time, and John T. Bogle disagreed
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.500]   with me, and darn if he isn't continuing to be right.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:05.040]   But let me tell you, about 13 years ago, I have portfolios that came into me just very,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:11.480]   very heavily weighted towards international, now very, very heavily weighted towards U.S.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.040]   And I used to say, if you can't be right, at least be consistent.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.960]   But I think the consistent is more important than being right.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   Christine?
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:28.040]   I wanted to note, too, Karen, I annually have been doing these compendia of capital market
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   forecasts.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.720]   So looking at what Vanguard is saying about returns for the next decade, looking at what
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.200]   our Morningstar team and so forth.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.320]   And so the idea is just to give you something to plug into your plan.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.960]   You need sort of some sort of return assumption to a firm.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.700]   They were all forecasting higher returns from non-U.S. equities relative to U.S. as of this
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.760]   latest look at the data.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.060]   One interesting thing, though, Karen, is that as recently as like a year ago, most firms
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.960]   were really forecasting much better returns for emerging markets relative to developed.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.480]   One thing I noticed in this latest survey was that that had really neutralized itself
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.360]   over the past year, in part because emerging markets performed really quite well in 2020.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:22.240]   So most firms sort of had parity in terms of their return expectations for emerging
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.420]   versus developed market stocks.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.920]   But nonetheless, I think there is a widespread view that foreign stocks, because of those
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.720]   cheaper starting valuations today, will likely outperform U.S.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.000]   And I want to just briefly ask you about the other side, which is on the fixed income side
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.260]   of people's portfolios.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.200]   What are your thoughts about how much of their fixed income holding should be international
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   versus U.S.?
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.880]   That has been a more contentious one, I would say, within the Bogleheads community.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.760]   So Christine, you want to start us off on that?
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.520]   And again, we'll just go around and then we'll move on.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   Sure.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.540]   I feel that it's less essential there, in part because it sort of gets back to, OK,
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.240]   what are you looking for your fixed income exposure to do for your portfolio?
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.360]   Yes, maybe a little bit of income, but mainly you're looking for that stabilizing influence
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.920]   in your portfolio.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:26.280]   And I think that it's not a slam dunk with non-U.S. bond exposure.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   So my bias would be that it's not essential.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   I'd be curious to hear what the other panelists might have to say on this.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.800]   And then another point I would make, Karen, is that oftentimes if people have a core intermediate
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:47.880]   term bond fund or what we call at Morningstar a core plus intermediate term bond fund, typically
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:53.080]   those funds do have some non-U.S. exposure, especially the active funds, whether a PIMCO
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.880]   total return or whatever it might be.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.760]   So investors who have such funds may have that kind of exposure in their portfolios
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   already.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.320]   I would just say as a side note with those core plus funds, when we look at things that
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.680]   hold up well in periods of equity market duress, those funds do not do as well.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.600]   So typically you get higher income because they dabble in some of these other areas,
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.760]   but they're less effective as shock absorbers.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.600]   So just a side note on that kind of core plus exposure that's a mainstay in so many investors'
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   portfolios.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.600]   Thank you.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.640]   Bill, what are your thoughts about international bond exposure?
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.600]   Well, you have a choice.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:39.160]   You can either not hedge the currency exposure, in which case you're taking excessive currency
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.600]   risk because you don't know the bond that you the currency exposure you get from foreign
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.880]   bonds doesn't get neutralized via export if that's the way it does with stocks.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.120]   Or you can hedge them.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.720]   And what you wind up doing when you do that is just getting a very expensive U.S. bond
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.040]   with a ridiculously low yield.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.120]   And so I've always thought that the correct allocation to foreign bonds is somewhere between
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.120]   zero and zero.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.640]   That's not a reason that I might add Vanguard target date funds, at least some of them do
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.680]   hold international bonds.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.600]   They are such marvelous products that that is not a reason not to own them.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.640]   You shouldn't sell your target date fund just because it's got a relatively small allocation
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.440]   international bonds.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.440]   Mike.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   Similar.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.400]   I mean, this is what Bill was saying.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.560]   I was just looking a couple of days ago, Vanguard total international bond as opposed to the
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.400]   U.S. total bond fund.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.200]   The difference in yield is almost one percent in favor of the domestic fund.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.920]   And at the same time, the international fund has a greater average duration.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.560]   So it's got more interest rate risk.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.140]   It's got more credit risk.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.560]   So it's higher risk for two reasons and significantly lower yield.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.760]   Almost a percent difference, especially right now.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.360]   That's a significant difference.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.760]   Another point that I I think this is important is with stocks.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.840]   One of the reasons we diversify is not just this rebalancing bonus concept.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.880]   It's that any given company can go to zero.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.560]   And so it's useful to just spread your money out among as many different companies as you
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   can.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.960]   And that's, in my opinion, one of the reasons why it makes sense to have some international
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.320]   holdings with fixed income.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:30.200]   That's not really applicable because there's a choice, FDIC insured CDs, treasury bonds
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.760]   where it's not going to go to zero.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.040]   You don't need diversification at all, necessarily.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.640]   Alan, international bond exposure or don't bother?
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.080]   I'd say don't bother if a client wants it.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.520]   I'm fine with having some, you know, the hedged Vanguard total international bond fund is
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:53.240]   by far the best around.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.800]   And I agree with Mike yet again, that the diversification doesn't do any good because
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:04.680]   let's face it, if the U.S. defaults on debt, our entire portfolios will be worthless and
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.000]   it won't be one of our top ten concerns.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.320]   OK, I think we're going to try and move our conversation over to talking a little more
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.800]   about financial planning topics for people who are approaching retirement.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.400]   So just to start with asset allocation.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:28.560]   So, Christine, you said the way you think about having that stability in a portfolio
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.320]   for someone who's approaching retirement is to think about having that 10 year bulwark
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.680]   of cash and safe money.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.320]   For other people who think about it not in terms of dollars, not in terms of years, but
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:51.800]   in terms of portfolio percentages, what might be a reasonable allocation for someone who
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:58.560]   is approaching retirement five years away or less to retirement?
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.880]   I think the starting point, Karen, has to be what are your certain sources of cash flow
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.840]   and retirement apart from your portfolio?
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.200]   So I would say, you know, the starting point is looking at your expenses and then subtracting
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.120]   out those safe sources of cash flow that you'll be able to rely on.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:23.000]   So Social Security for most of us, pensions for some of us, annuities possibly for those
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   of us who want to augment that safe source of cash flow.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.640]   So use that as the starting point.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.200]   And I think what we'll find if we look at across retirees is a wide amount of variability
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.480]   in terms of how much of their cash flow needs are being supplied by those certain sources
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:46.600]   of income, which is why I'm not comfortable throwing out one size fits all asset allocations
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.860]   because the toolkit that we all bring into retirement is so different.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:58.060]   So I really like the idea of using our expected portfolio demands to drive how much we hold
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.600]   in safer assets.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.680]   And just to follow up on that 10 years worth of withdrawals that I talked about, the way
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.760]   I arrived at that is simply by looking at the probability of having a positive return
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.520]   from stocks over various time horizons.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:20.540]   So when you look over market history at rolling 10 year period returns, stocks have historically
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.840]   been really quite reliable from the standpoint of the likelihood that if you have a 10 year
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.160]   time horizon, pretty good odds that you'll have a positive return.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.400]   Once you start to reduce that, then you're getting into some probabilities that you might
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:41.680]   not like, which is one reason why I come back to that idea of yes, by all means hold an
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:47.120]   ample portfolio of stocks, but make sure that at the front end you're building in enough
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.620]   safe assets that you could spend through if stocks go down and stay down.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:43:00.640]   So I really prefer that approach because people's safe sources of cash flow do tend to be so
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.860]   variable based on what they have going on.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.160]   Okay.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.860]   We talked some before about social security, Mike's open social security calculator.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:18.060]   Mike, if you were talking to people who were five years or less away from retirement, are
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:25.820]   there any other general pointers you would want to give them about planning for social
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.820]   security?
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:33.580]   Yeah, one of them is really right in line with what Christine was just saying.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.700]   I think one of the ways to think about asset allocation in retirement is to be looking
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.140]   at your other sources of income.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:49.140]   So for example, if you are planning to retire at age 65, but you're planning on taking social
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:53.700]   security at age 70, and you've got this five year window where you're going to be spending
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.860]   more from the portfolio than you will be for the rest of your retirement.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.260]   And so I think it makes sense to allocate basically a chunk of the portfolio to satisfy
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.220]   that extra spending for those five years.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:11.580]   And when I say that, I mean specifically put it in something that you would use for spending
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.580]   over five years.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:17.260]   So we're not talking about stocks, it's maybe a five year CD ladder or something like that.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.260]   So if you know that that's going to be the case for you, that there's going to be additional
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:26.920]   portfolio spending early in your retirement years, I think it can be wise to start setting
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.500]   that up as sort of sub portfolios, start setting those up in advance.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:40.460]   So far, we've talked a lot about very financial topics, but Alan, I'd like to ask you to,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.300]   to take a sort of a bigger step back.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:49.180]   So if you're talking to clients, who are five years or less from retirement, besides doing
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:55.500]   all that financial analysis and planning, tell me a little bit about things you talked
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:01.180]   to them about and conversations that if it's a couple they should be having with each other
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.300]   as they're planning for retirement.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:11.260]   Wow, I think when they're close to retirement, the first thing I let people know, especially
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:16.340]   if they're retiring young, that they're likely to spend more money because they're going
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:22.660]   to have more time on their hands to hopefully travel again once COVID is behind us, eat
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.540]   out, golf, whatever.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:31.020]   I have the discussion with them, I try to reframe the social security question, because
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.380]   there's always this instinct to want to take it early.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:42.700]   So I tell them what they are doing is buying the best deferred immediate annuity inflation
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:46.020]   adjusted backed by the US government on the planet.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:51.420]   So I give them permission actually to spend as much as they would have gotten had they
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:59.300]   taken it at 62 or earlier, because I'm reframing it that they're buying something, or they're
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.300]   buying that insurance product.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.580]   What else do I tell them?
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.460]   They're likely to spend more, oh, develop a budget.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.660]   And I use David Blanchett's framework there of discretionary versus non-discretionary.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.580]   If things don't go well, you know, these are things that they can cut.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:31.860]   Look, I was in Japan in 1989, almost 32 years ago, and the market is 20% lower today than
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   it was back then.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.260]   So we can't always count on markets having quick recoveries.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:44.620]   All three recoveries so far this century have been very quick, especially the one last year.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.540]   So just be prepared.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.940]   And finally, telling them that the cost of running out of money is a lot higher than
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.900]   the cost of dying with the money.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:05.220]   Christine, are there things or conversations that spouses should be having as they're approaching
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.380]   retirement about money and about other topics?
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:15.420]   Yeah, to amplify Alan's points about spending and referencing David Blanchett, my colleague,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:20.660]   David's done some really neat work looking at the trajectory of retiree spending in retirement
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.660]   spending and has identified exactly what Alan's talking about.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.340]   He calls it the retirement spending smile.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:33.580]   So you have early on higher spending for fun stuff, usually travel and maybe some family
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.380]   things like weddings or whatever it might be, then leveling off sort of in the middle
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:45.860]   part of retirement, and then going higher again later in retirement, often due to uninsured
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.460]   health care costs.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.660]   This idea of sort of like flatline, inflation adjusted consumption in retirement really
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.100]   doesn't sync up with the patterns we see when we look at retirement spending.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.140]   So thinking about that, and one thing I've talked about with this group before is just
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.660]   the importance of making sure you have a long term care plan in place.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:12.260]   For many folks that will be self funding, long term care, certainly I would guess that
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.860]   many Vogel heads will choose to go this route.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:21.380]   But if that's your plan, I would say, make sure that you are segregating those long term
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:26.740]   care assets from your expendable assets, so that you're not considering them as part of
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.900]   the sustainability of your withdrawal rate.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:35.760]   But really thinking through what does my long term care plan look like, not just how we'll
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.020]   pay for it, but also what are the logistics of that long term care plan, whether you'll
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:46.700]   receive care at home as many people naturally would want to do, whether you're comfortable
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.420]   with some sort of institutionalized setting.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:56.220]   So really putting the finer points on a long term care plan, I think is key.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.860]   And then another thing I like to think about, especially with respect to the Vogel heads
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.660]   is get a succession plan in place for your portfolio.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.620]   So if for whatever reason you are unable to continue doing this as successfully as you've
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:15.820]   been, and maybe as much as you've enjoyed it, make sure that you have a well articulated
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.060]   plan that someone could pick up and run with if they needed to.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.680]   So maybe it's identifying a good quality financial advisor.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.420]   Especially if your spouse isn't into this stuff, the last thing you want is for him
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.340]   or her to be out there shopping for an advisor with really no clear sense of what they're
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.560]   looking for.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:41.020]   So articulate a succession plan if your plan is that a trusted adult child will take this
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.380]   over for you.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.540]   Really articulate your plan, make sure the child is on board with doing this for you.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:53.660]   But I love the idea of not just estate planning, but also succession planning for the portfolio.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.560]   That's a very smart way to look at it.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.420]   And I guess the other thing I was going to ask, maybe Mike, you can address.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.300]   It seems like when you get into retirement and the spend down decisions that I know Christine
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:09.660]   has also written a lot about, but it seems like your taxes get very complicated.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:15.900]   You have a lot of pretty sophisticated balancing to make right about which accounts you draw
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.140]   down from to be tax smart.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:30.480]   And the complicated thing is that in retirement, there's just additional points of tax complexity
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.500]   that come into play that don't apply earlier.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.540]   So the way Social Security is taxed, there's this range of income where each dollar of
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:44.380]   income causes not only the amount of income tax, it also causes 50 cents or 85 cents of
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.860]   Social Security to become taxable.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:52.300]   So in the Fogelhut's Guide to Retirement Planning, it's referred to as the Social Security tax
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   hump.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.300]   And I like that name.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.320]   I've been using it ever since, because it's this range where your marginal tax rate is
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:03.740]   considerably higher than the tax bracket that you're in, but then it goes away and it comes
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.380]   your marginal tax rate comes back down.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.260]   And then Medicare income related monthly adjustment amount.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:15.120]   There's specific thresholds where one dollar of income can cost you several hundred dollars
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.500]   or more than a thousand dollars of Medicare premiums two years from now.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:28.320]   And so basically, it can be very worthwhile to carefully look at what your actual marginal
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:34.960]   tax rate is for each dollar of income before taking distributions from tax deferred accounts.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.040]   Just make sure that you're not accidentally about to cross some threshold that's going
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.080]   to cause your Medicare premiums to jump up or to cause you to lose eligibility for a
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.160]   particular deduction or credit.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.120]   And just being very careful, I guess, with it.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.720]   A lot of people we see on Vogelheads a lot, frankly, people talk about Roth conversions,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:58.680]   which can be very useful, especially early in retirement before Social Security and RMDs
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   kick in.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.060]   But people often say, oh, I'm going to do Roth conversions through the such and such
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.980]   tax bracket.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.980]   That might make sense.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.480]   But there's a good chance that when you do that, you're just blowing right through these
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:17.200]   other thresholds that aren't about tax brackets and you're causing unintended tax consequences
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.840]   when you do that sometimes.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   Alan?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.480]   Yeah, I've always argued investing is simple.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.160]   I never argued taxes were.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:33.120]   So there are just a whole bunch of things that people can do in retirement before they
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.280]   started their required minimum distribution, Social Security, and all of them can backfire.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.440]   I mean, one of my favorite is a long term capital gain at a zero percent tax rate.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:49.600]   But yes, that can backfire, too, on the Medicare earnings offset and other things as well.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.280]   So really, an in-depth analysis is required.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.560]   And tax planning can always backfire because tax laws change.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:11.720]   I thought I'd ask you an asset allocation question that came in from one of our viewers.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.800]   What is the optimal portfolio for a stingy retired bogal head who will never spend all
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.760]   of his retirement account and is saving for the next generation?
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:28.680]   Well, that's that person puts the question very nicely, which is that person really isn't
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.480]   managing the money for them.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.640]   They're managing money for future generations.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:40.240]   So it's got a very long time horizon, theoretically should be a very risky stock heavy portfolio,
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:49.420]   which they're going to have to limit by how risk averse they and their successors are.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.520]   But it gets back to what Christine was talking about.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:56.800]   There are people who are fortunate enough to have all of their living expenses covered
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:03.200]   by their Social Security and pensions, who knows alimony.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.920]   And that person is really not managing money for themselves.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.800]   They're managing money for successive generations.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.280]   It's a completely different computation.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:23.680]   OK, I think one of the things I want to ask about while we have a few more minutes, we
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:30.040]   have a new administration in Washington, a Democratic controlled Congress.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:38.720]   I'm wondering if there are proposals in the tax area and retirement plans that you guys
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.680]   are keeping an eye on or that you think the Bogle heads might want to keep watch on.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.760]   So, Alan, do you want to take us off on that one?
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.000]   Yeah, I don't predict the market and I really don't predict politicians.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.080]   I mean, the year that Congress let the state tax go unlimited, all bets are off.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.840]   I just don't make any predictions.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:08.720]   I just try to monitor them and react to what is being passed.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:15.280]   And, you know, that's the two things that scare me are the elimination of the long term
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.960]   capital gains tax rate and possibly the step up basis, which would make all the work that
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.640]   I've done on asset location mute.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.000]   It wouldn't make it worse, but doesn't make it any better.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.240]   Why don't we just briefly talk about step up and basis.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:35.880]   Let's just review very briefly what it is and why that would be such a change in planning.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:44.160]   Well, if a stock or stock index fund is in a regular taxable account, you know, not a
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:53.320]   irrevocable trust, then upon death, the heirs get that security and never have to pay taxes
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.160]   on that capital gains taxes.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.280]   Did I do OK on that?
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:06.600]   Christine, are there are there thoughts about other aspects of potential changes in tax
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.960]   law or retirement issues that you're keeping an eye on?
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:16.440]   Yeah, like Alan, I think a sensible approach is to just monitor what's going on.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:24.200]   I do think that maybe some action in the estate tax realm is an area to watch where we have
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.840]   this currently very high exclusion, the amount that you can die with and not have it be subject
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.440]   to the estate tax.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:39.720]   To me, it seems like there might be some opportunity for bipartisan support for lowering that.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.120]   And you know, you could you could drop it in half and still not affect the vast majority
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.340]   of Americans.
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:56.020]   So I think that that's one potential area of change that that we might see in Congress.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:02.980]   I tend to be less concerned about the change in the step up for reasons that Alan articulated.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.060]   That is seismic.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:09.860]   So if the step up in basis goes away, that would just have such widespread repercussions
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:13.660]   for regular middle class families.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   So I would expect that there would be more bipartisan support to not do anything with
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   that.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.460]   But again, it's just kind of a guessing game.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.800]   Okay.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.500]   I think we're going to wrap up now.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   I want to just end with one little thought on taxes that I know Mike has said that while
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.940]   we may watch these things that are possibly going to develop in Washington, we really
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.660]   better make sure we're paying attention to the current tax code and planning for the
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:51.820]   near term when the things that we do have some visibility on and potentially opportunities
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.500]   to act on.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.860]   We have run out of time.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.620]   I feel like we've covered a lot of interesting things today.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.620]   Thank you very much to all four of you.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:07.380]   It has been great to see you and I'm going to throw it back to Rick now.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.460]   Thank you, Karen, and the panel members for the outstanding discussion.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.300]   A lot of great information put out today.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.340]   I hope that it was useful to you.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.140]   I hope you enjoyed this presentation and the format that we have put forward for you.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:25.980]   This was recorded and will be available soon on boglehead.com and on the bogelcenter.net
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.580]   website.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.900]   Our next Boglehead speaker series live event will likely be in April and the guest is yet
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   to be announced.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.700]   Again, thanks for joining us today.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:40.220]   We hope you and your family remain safe and warm for the rest of the winter.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.020]   See you next time.
