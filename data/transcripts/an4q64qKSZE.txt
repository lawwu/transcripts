[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   I go to Starbucks with my wife.
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.560]   She was going to write a book at the same time.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.840]   She was going to write it on managing.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840]   I was going to write it on just investing and rentals.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.720]   And we sat down at a Starbucks and we made a commitment to
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.640]   ourselves and said, we will not leave this Starbucks until our
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.920]   book is 100% perfectly outlined.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.240]   It's like the Abe Lincoln quote.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.600]   If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I would spend the
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.760]   first four sharpening my ax.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.280]   So what this whole strategy was like, I'm going to spend a focused,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.640]   dedicated nonstop period of time to sharpen the ax.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   So for me, I sat down, I spec'd out the entire book on note cards.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.440]   It was like 12 chapters, 12 sub chapters, flip every card over
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   and it had an outline of what that sub chapter is going to be about.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120]   So every day I had a note card for a hundred days straight with
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.160]   what chapter it's in, what the sub chapter is, and then three, four,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.760]   five bullet points on what I had to write.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.680]   Well, that's easy.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.200]   Now I just got to write 500 words to a thousand words a day.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.940]   And within exactly 100 days later, my wife and I both finished a book.
