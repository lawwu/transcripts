[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Welcome back to a new week of episodes. We have some interesting questions on
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   the table this week, and we begin with a question here from a listener named JT
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100]   who asks, "Pastor John, do you ever plan to add a chapter to the book Desiring
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.880]   God, a chapter called The Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism?" It's a fair question
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.760]   because when I wrote Desiring God 28 years ago, I put in the preface these
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.280]   words, "The church that I love and serve has made my writing possible. The
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.920]   partnership that I enjoy with the elders and staff is priceless. There is a
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.360]   chapter yet to be completed. It is called The Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   May the Spirit Himself continue to write it on the tablets of our hearts."
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.200]   So that's where this question is coming from. This person has read the preface,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.920]   and it's 28 years ago that I wrote it, and I haven't written that chapter in
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.120]   writing. When I wrote those words in the preface, what I meant was that
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.240]   this chapter called The Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism, this chapter is a
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.680]   chapter I wanted to be writing by my life for the rest of my life in the
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880]   fellowship of the church. That was the gist of that. The Camaraderie of
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.760]   Christian Hedonism is what I wanted my life to be, and I have been writing it. To
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.600]   this very day, I would say those same words about the church that I have
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.080]   served and now attend and still love deeply. In fact, I woke up this morning
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.640]   enjoying and praying for my church that I'm a part of, and the ministries like
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.520]   Desiring God and Bethlehem College and the seminary that have grown out of that
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.920]   church. My life is so rich with The Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism, and in
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   that sense, I'm still writing it in prayer and fellowship. But the question
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.840]   still stands. Will I, should I write an actual paper-and-ink chapter called The
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.800]   Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism? And the answer is, I might. Here's one of the
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.040]   reasons I haven't felt an urgency to do it yet. It's because there is such a
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.720]   significant overlap between what that chapter would be and what is already
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   there in the chapter on love and the chapter on prayer. Love, the labor of
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200]   Christian hedonism, and prayer, the power of Christian hedonism. In the love
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.080]   chapter, I talk about how our joy in God is filled to the full when it overflows
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.640]   for others, or when it expands like a high-pressure weather zone to draw
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.800]   others into it. And that's the essence of The Camaraderie of Christian Hedonism.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   And in the prayer chapter, I deal with how the enjoyment of God's gifts relate
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.520]   to the enjoyment of God himself, and that's the essential issue that would
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.360]   have to be dealt with in that chapter. But if I were to write the chapter—and I
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   might, because it's worthy, it's worthy—it could bear another saying, I think, that
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.840]   the texts from which I would work would be these. I'll just give you a few.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.000]   Philippians 1:4, "In every prayer of mine for you all, I make my prayer with joy."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   Paul's just thrilled to pray for his comrades in arms at Philippi. Or
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.640]   Philippians 1:8, "God is my witness how I yearn for you all with the affection of
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.800]   Christ Jesus." So Paul delights in the church at Philippi with the very delight
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.200]   of Christ. That's worth a chapter. 1 Thessalonians 2:8, "So being
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.400]   affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.940]   gospel but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us." Or the
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.640]   same thing almost in Philippians 4, "Therefore my brothers whom I love and
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.000]   long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord." So he's
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.920]   calling them his joy and his crown. One more, 1 Thessalonians 2:19, "For what
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.880]   is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before the Lord Jesus at his coming? Is
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   it not you? You are our glory and joy." So just in those few verses, there's enough
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.460]   to justify a chapter on the camaraderie of Christian hedonism. So it's clear to
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.340]   me that Paul felt no contradiction between having God as his supreme
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.980]   treasure and counting everything as lost compared to the supreme value of Jesus
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.940]   on the one hand, and on the other hand, saying that the church, the people of God,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:34.500]   were his joy and crown and boast and glory. And surely the reason for this is
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.620]   that God raised up these people. God is filling these people with himself. God
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.820]   will keep these people and transform these people into the image of his Son,
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.060]   so these people will be a beautiful witness to the grace and the glory of
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.980]   God, and these people will never compete with Christ for his supreme worth,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.900]   but will always signal that worth and embody that worth and help Paul and us
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.220]   know that worth more and more. So that'd be the gist of my chapter right there,
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.620]   and pray for me, and maybe the Lord will incline me to write "The Camaraderie of
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.220]   Christian Hedonism." Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John. And the book Desiring God is
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.660]   foundational for us at DesiringGod.org, of course, as you can imagine. And you can
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.660]   download and begin reading Desiring God right now, free of charge, by going to our
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.980]   website DesiringGod.org and click on the Books tab. There you will find it under
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.260]   its title, Desiring God. So we know a little bit about the most influential
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.060]   Calvinists in John Piper's ministry, men like Jonathan Edwards, but who have been
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.340]   the most influential Arminian writers? Hmm. I'll ask him tomorrow on the Ask
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.980]   Pastor John podcast. Thanks for listening.
