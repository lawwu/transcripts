[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   We're joined again by pastor and author Tim Keller.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.220]   He has a wonderful book coming out soon titled Prayer, Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.000]   God and it may just be one of the best Christian books of 2014.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.420]   That's not hyperbole.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.760]   He joins us from New York City to talk about prayer and I asked him two questions yesterday.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.960]   Here we go with two more.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.060]   Question number three, Dr. Keller.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.880]   Throughout your new book on prayer, you warn readers about moving from Bible study to prayer.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.400]   Skipping over one crucial step in the middle, which is meditation.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.480]   Why are we quick to skip right over this step of meditation?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:49.320]   Well, it's possible that we're quick to miss this step because we live in a culture that
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   doesn't encourage solitude and reflection.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.080]   It's also possible that evangelicalism is a little bit too shaped by rational, rational,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.440]   I should say rationalism maybe, rationality, rationalism.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.120]   So our approach to the Bible sometimes is get the meaning through the grammatical historical
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.400]   exegesis and once you got the meaning, then there it is and that's all you need and you
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.540]   don't have to work it into your heart.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.100]   So maybe we're too rationalistic, maybe we don't have the solitude.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.640]   But if you read Martin Luther, especially his, well any of Martin Luther, Martin Luther
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.360]   believed that you need to take the truth that you have learned through good exegesis.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.000]   I'm a little concerned about some approaches to reading the Bible that says don't read
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.800]   the Bible and listen to God speaking to you, don't think about theology, just let God speak
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   to you.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.880]   I'm a little concerned about that because the way God speaks to you in the Bible is
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.520]   after you do good exegesis and you figure out what the text is saying.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   But once you understand that, Luther said you need to learn how to warm your heart with
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.880]   it, get it into your heart.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.980]   And it really diminishes our prayer life because our hearts are cold and we get into prayer.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.520]   And I think without meditation, you tend to go right into petition and supplication and
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.200]   you do very little adoration or confession.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.880]   Because when your heart is warm, then you start to praise God and then you confess.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.120]   When your heart is cold, which it is if you just study the Bible and then jump to prayer,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.520]   is you're much more likely to spend your time on your prayer list and not really engage
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   your heart that much.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.720]   >> So it seems a key to the fruitful prayer life is the conviction that the Bible was
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.920]   really and truly written for me personally.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.040]   >> Well, yes, of course it is.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.260]   I mean, you know, Deuteronomy 29, 29, "The secret things belong to God, but the things
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.340]   that are revealed are revealed that you may do them."
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.640]   And so, of course, the Bible is the part of God's will and mind that he wants us to know.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   But the way you determine what he's saying in the Word of God is through sound theological
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.200]   exegesis.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   But then once you discern the meaning, you have to work it into your heart to make sure
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.520]   it does become a personal word to you and not just a concept you hold with a mind.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   >> Excellent.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.680]   All right, on to question number four.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.080]   Last December on Twitter, you were asked, "Why do you think young Christian adults struggle
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.280]   most deeply with God as a personal reality in their lives?"
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.160]   And you replied, "Noise and distraction.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's easier to tweet than to pray."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That's sadly true.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.320]   I mean, we are fickle people, and for all the many benefits of digital technology, we
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.080]   are tempted to get distracted from prayer by tweets and our Facebook feeds and texts
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   and emails on our phone.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   I mean, in a sense, we want to be distracted.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.960]   So what counsel would you give to a Christian who finds himself or herself lured to distractions
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.160]   when they are trying to pray?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.760]   >> Well, I may have just answered the question.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   I mean, primarily, there is no way around just simply the discipline of saying, "This
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.040]   is something I've got to spend time doing."
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   In my book on prayer, I tell a story about how my wife used an illustration on me, and
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.240]   she basically said, "If a doctor said you have a fatal condition unless you take this
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.920]   medicine and every night from 11 to 11, 15, you have to swallow these pills and do this
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   thing, otherwise you'll be dead by morning," she said, "you'd never miss.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.960]   You would never say, 'I was too tired.'
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.120]   You'd never say, 'I didn't get to it,' or 'I was watching a movie and I didn't leave
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   time.'
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.560]   You never would do that.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   If anything that you know you've got to do, you do."
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.400]   And so when people say, "Well, I don't know.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   How am I going to get to prayer?
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   How am I going to deal with the distraction?"
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.160]   I say, "I'm sorry, you don't believe you need prayer, and that's a theological spiritual
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.080]   problem, and there's nothing I can do except tell you you need to get your heart straight
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.640]   and your mind straight on that."
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.840]   However, having said that, once you've determined you've got to do it, inside your prayer time,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.440]   it's hard sometimes to keep from being distracted.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.880]   That's where meditation helps.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.520]   See, Martin Luther said that if you warm your heart through meditation on the Scripture
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   so that your heart starts to really warm up, and you go into prayer because you want to
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.560]   pray, because you want to praise Him for what you see, and you want to confess your sins,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.800]   meditation on a passage of the Scripture actually, in my case, it helps me from, keeps me from
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   being distracted.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   Because it means you've got to figure this out.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.360]   You've got to say, "Okay, what does it mean to me?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   What is it?
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.880]   How do I praise God for this?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.160]   How do I confess for this?
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.760]   How do I petition for this?"
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.040]   Meditation warms the heart and absorbs the mind so I'm not as distracted.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   So I guess the answer is twofold.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.920]   One is you've got to decide it's something you've got to do, and there's nothing I can
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.960]   do to help you with that.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.280]   But once you're inside, meditation keeps you from having your mind wandering during your
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   prayer time.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   >> Good.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.480]   Very pointed and convicting, but very good.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Thank you, Dr. Keller.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.200]   And tomorrow, I'll ask you questions number five and six, including something that we've
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.320]   touched on previously, but I want to expand on, because lament is part of the healthy
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.240]   Christian life, as you argue in the book.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   So that means prayer includes complaining.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.440]   So how does a good Calvinist complain to God?
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   That's tomorrow.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
