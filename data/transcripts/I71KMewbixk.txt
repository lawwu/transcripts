[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.880]   Today we launch our 2015 Conference for Pastors
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.200]   in partnership with Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.520]   The Pastors Conference kicks off this afternoon
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.040]   and it will be a full afternoon and evening
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.800]   of festivities at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.640]   As always, I look forward to seeing many of you
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.560]   in town for it and for those of you who refuse
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.440]   to venture into Minneapolis in the winter time.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.800]   The conference will be streamed online.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   You can go to desiringgod.org/live
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.080]   for the schedule and for the video stream.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.820]   We're back with guest Matt Chandler.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.540]   He's the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.240]   Matt is also the author of the new book,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.640]   "The Mingling of Souls, God's Design for Love,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.780]   Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.840]   And he joins us on the phone from Dallas.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.240]   Matt, I've got 10 questions on relationships
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.480]   queued up for you and we're working through them.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.840]   Eventually I wanna ask you about Facebook today.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.240]   But first, here's question number two.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.480]   Is there such thing as too fast in Christian dating?
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.240]   How do you know if a dating relationship
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.840]   is moving too quickly emotionally
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   or too quickly towards marriage?
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.960]   - So I'm gonna be real cautious about saying
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.720]   there is such a thing as too quickly.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.120]   What I'd rather do is say what's driving the speed?
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   And so if mere physical attraction
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.340]   or kind of emotive, frilly,
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.060]   this is quote unquote the one type of weirdness
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.300]   is driving it, then yeah, I think if the relationship
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.080]   is outpacing a knowledge of character,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.880]   reputation, and knowledge of godliness,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.240]   then that's way too quick.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480]   But again, to go back to what I said earlier,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   if the person is known, if you're in a context
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.960]   in which you have watched their godliness,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.220]   you have marveled at their character,
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.440]   you have rejoiced in what God does in them and through them,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.360]   then I think that speed isn't as big of a factor.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.760]   So we have a staff person here
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.440]   who really met and married her husband
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960]   in a matter of months.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.720]   But she had watched him do ministry at the village,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.740]   she knew his reputation.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   There were these things that were already known,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.120]   and so what was driving the relationship,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.520]   what wasn't kind of a flare up of emotions,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   wasn't a type of desperation or loneliness
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.720]   and this idea of maybe this is my only shot
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   or anything like that, it wasn't,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.700]   oh, I just physically find him so attractive,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.400]   but rather there was a knowledge of his faithfulness to God,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.120]   his desire to serve the Lord,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.560]   his seriousness about the things of God.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.320]   And so, man, they flew,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   I hardly knew they were dating before they were engaged.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.780]   And even then, they were counseled by one of our pastors
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.360]   that this was moving too quick
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.040]   and that they should slow down.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160]   And they listened and heeded a bit,
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.260]   but went on and got married.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.640]   And I think they had a little hitch here and there
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.240]   after marriage, but who doesn't, right?
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.000]   I mean, I was dated Lauren for two years
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.280]   and we still had plenty of hitches
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   our first couple of years.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.640]   And so, I'd rather not say, yeah, there is too fast
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.680]   as much as I would wanna know what's driving the speed.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.960]   - Very good.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Okay, on to question number three, Matt.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.240]   In your experience, in what ways is technology
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.680]   changing the way young people date today?
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.740]   And do these trends encourage you or do they concern you?
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.400]   - If we're talking about a young man and a young woman
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.960]   who are actively dating, they've defined the relationship
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.440]   and they know that they're in a growing,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.820]   committed relationship with one another.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.240]   I think technology creates an avenue
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.840]   in which we might encourage one another,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   that we might be able to connect more frequently
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.560]   in regards to the busyness of the world.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.040]   And so, in that way, I'm encouraged
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.920]   by what technology has to offer.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.680]   If though, we're saying that technology has changed the game
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.880]   in regards to how single young men and women
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.460]   approach one another before that relationship
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600]   is being defined, then that's where I've got a lot of cause
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.260]   and concern about technology.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.240]   Because what I've found is that the ability to text
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.440]   or to tweet at or to write on someone's wall,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   I'm not on Facebook, I think I said that right,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.240]   that those things enable you to kind of flirt
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   and to tease without there ever being a,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.680]   what exactly is this moment?
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.840]   And so, in that regard, I think it can be hurtful
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   to constantly be texting back and forth
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   and to constantly be involved in the technological realm
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.680]   rather than the face-to-face realm.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.820]   And yet, and so you don't really know what this thing is.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.880]   And so, in that way, I've got some concerns.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.480]   So, I would just, if I think about my daughters,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.000]   to have a young man constantly texting them,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.040]   constantly engaging them on social media
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.960]   without any real clear, I'm pursuing you,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   any real clear desire to want to establish
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.680]   a shared knowledge of this relationship.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.820]   We both want this relationship to grow.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.520]   I think I've got concerns there.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.680]   I just see a lot of our young women at The Village
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.680]   really get led into and teased by the ability for guys
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   to just kind of like every post of theirs
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.720]   or constantly text the young woman
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.040]   without ever really kind of defining what this is.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   - That's very wise caution, thank you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400]   That was Matt Chandler, the lead pastor
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.080]   at The Village Church in Dallas
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.440]   and the author of the new book, "The Mingling of Souls,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.960]   "God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.240]   Tomorrow, I wanna know how should our local churches
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.800]   be serving young men and women
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.400]   to help them cultivate marriages?
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.880]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
