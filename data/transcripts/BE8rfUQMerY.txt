[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Is joy a choice or is joy just a feeling that comes and goes?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   That's a great question, one our culture asks all the time.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And if our joy is a choice, whose choice is it ultimately?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   That actually was the question I attempted to answer in my book,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   The Joy Project. I know a number of you have read that book.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I think that's a better way to frame the essentials of Calvinism,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   the doctrines of grace, the five points of Calvinism.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   God's sovereign joy in pursuit of us.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   But here's the specific question on the table today as it comes to us
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   from Susan in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   My question is pretty straightforward.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Can you tell me if joy in God is a choice that we make
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   or is our joy in God a feeling that comes to us after we do
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   a certain something else first that will then lead to joy?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Here's an amazing fact to start off with.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   If you consider all the forms of the word choose or choice or decide or decision,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   the New Testament never applies those words to the act of choosing God
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   or choosing Christ or choosing Christianity.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I think that would come as a shock to a lot of people.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   One almost exception is Mary choosing to sit at Jesus' feet
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   while Martha did the housework, but she's already a follower.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   In fact, the one place where choosing Jesus is mentioned, it's denied.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   In John 15, 16, Jesus said, "You did not choose me. I chose you."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   In other words, when the disciples chose to follow Jesus,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   that wasn't ultimately their choice.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It was God's choice. He was decisive in that event.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   God's choosing us is mentioned over and over and over in the New Testament,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   but our choosing him is not mentioned, not with the words choose or decide.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Now, if you go to the Old Testament, there's that famous statement of Joshua
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   in chapter 24, verse 15, "Choose you this day whom you will serve,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   whether the gods of your fathers that they served in the region beyond the river
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   or the gods of the Amorites. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So Joshua is happy to call for a choice to serve God or not.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But then a few verses later, he says this. This is verses 22, 23 of chapter 24.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to serve him.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Then put away the foreign gods that are among you
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel."
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now, why did Joshua add, "Incline your heart"?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He said it because there is such a thing as choosing to serve God
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   while the heart is far from God.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Jesus said that. He said it in Matthew 15, 8.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So they are choosing to go to church on Sunday morning.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   They choose to sing. They choose to pray.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They choose to go to the synagogue. They choose to give tithes.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And on the outside, they look like they've chosen God.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   They have not chosen God.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   They have chosen religion to hide the fact that their heart wants something else besides God.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's why Joshua said, "It's not enough.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   This is not enough to choose to serve God.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Your heart must incline to the Lord.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   The Lord must be your treasure.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Not the praise of man, not health, not wealth, not prosperity."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Now, the way all of this relates to Susan's question
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   is that this inclination of the heart that Joshua and Jesus refer to
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   is deeper than a choice.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's a kind of joy in God.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So Joshua was saying what Psalm 100 says.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   If you're choosing to serve God, then let that choice be acceptable to God.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let it be honoring to God by, Psalm 100 verse 2,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "Serving the Lord with gladness."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's a command. Serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That is, have your heart inclined to God.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Not just choose to serve Him.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Serve Him with gladness.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   For a choice to be pleasing to God and honoring to God,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   it must be rooted in the heart's taste for God.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Gladness in God.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   In other words, a choice for God, a preference for God that honors God
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   must be rooted in the heart's experience of God as preferable.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   What makes a choice to serve God real is that the choice expresses
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   the fact that the heart has found God to be preferable, desirable, valuable.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   When Jesus said that people had chosen to honor God with their lips
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   but not with their hearts because their hearts were far from Him,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   He meant their hearts did not taste God as desirable.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They didn't taste God as valuable.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They didn't taste God as preferable.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Their taste was for the praise of man, not God.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So my answer for Susan is, no, joy is not a choice.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It is deeper.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It is the gift of an experience of God as desirable, preferable, valuable.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's not a mere choice.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It is the God-given spontaneous response to seeing God as desirable,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   tasting Him as good, as preferable to other satisfactions.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's what it means in 1 Peter 2, verse 2, when it says,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   "Desire the pure spiritual milk if you have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Tasting is not a choice.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   If you put a lemon in your mouth,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   no amount of choosing can make it taste like sugar.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   It's not a choice.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's the way your taste buds are designed,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and there are taste buds on the soul that are either ruined or alive,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   which brings us then to the other part of Susan's question
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and how our spiritual taste buds might be changed.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And she asks, "Is joy in God a feeling that comes after we do something else
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   that leads to joy in God?"
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Now, the very fact that we're talking about joy in God,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   not just joy generically, but joy in God, that God is our joy,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   implies that we need to have some knowledge of God
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   in order to have authentic joy in God.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That means that any steps we can take to put ourselves in the way
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   of true knowledge of God may prove to be the very action
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   that leads to joy in God.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So in that sense, yes, yes, Susan, joy in God is a feeling that comes
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   after we do something else that leads to joy in God,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   namely listen to the truth about God.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   If joy in God is the heart's experience of preferring God,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   desiring God, treasuring God, then it's not surprising
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   that the main thing we can do in order to experience this
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   is look intently at God's greatness, God's beauty, God's worth in his word.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Faith, Paul says, and I would say, "And the joy of faith,"
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to take that phrase from Philippians 1, "Faith and the joy of faith
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   comes by hearing and hearing or reading by the word of God."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And there is another action, I'll just mention one more,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   that we can do and should do in the pursuit of joy in God.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   We should pray, pray two prayers with the psalmists.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They prayed like this because they had the same experience
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   of sometimes feeling what they ought to feel and sometimes not feeling
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   what they ought to feel in regard to the joy we should have in God.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Psalm 119, verse 18, "Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   out of your word." And Psalm 90, verse 14,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   "Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, O God."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So we should pray to have eyes to see and hearts to feel.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So in summary, Susan, joy in God is not a choice.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   It is a God-given, spontaneous experience of the beauty, worth,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   greatness of God. But there are choices that we can make
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   that may lead to that experience because the Bible says,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   "Look, look and pray." Look at the Lord in His word
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   and pray for eyes to see and a heart to feel.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Amen. Satisfaction in God, that is a God-given,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   spontaneous experience. It's as if there is a sovereign joy
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   pursuing us, seeking us out, choosing us, giving us new desires
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   for the glory that we behold. Beautiful. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That, again, is the theme I pick up in my book, The Joy Project,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   if you want more on this. Sovereign joy in pursuit of us.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   A better way, I think, of reframing the five points of Calvinism.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And I mention my book here because it's a whole book inspired by one paragraph
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   from Pastor John's 1998 biography of Augustine.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   One paragraph from that incredible bio message became my entire book,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   The Joy Project. You can download the entire thing right now
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   at DesiringGod.org. Speaking of joy, the Bible, all over the place,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   commands us to rejoice, commands us to rejoice.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   So if I'm not joyful, I'm sinning, right?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Hmm. That's the question next. I'm Tony Reinke. See you on Thursday.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   (end)
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   (music)
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   (music)
