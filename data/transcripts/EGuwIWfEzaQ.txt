[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.780]   In this episode, we'll venture into new trends affecting the mutual fund industry with special
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.180]   focus on the exponential growth of actively managed ETFs. So with no further ado, let's welcome back
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.060]   Jeff Pitek. Welcome back to Bogleheads on Investing, Jeff.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.800]   Oh, Rick, thanks so much. It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.380]   Well, a lot has happened in the mutual fund and ETF industry since I had you on a few years ago.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.920]   It's really accelerated, especially ETFs that have come out and the number of companies
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.860]   that are creating ETFs now. So today we want to go over the state of the mutual fund and ETF marketplace.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.480]   Look at the new funds that are opening, funds that are closing. We'll get into the active
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.500]   versus passive debate again. I mean, is this helping? And we'll talk about some portfolio
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.900]   management items at the end. Why don't we start out with the state of the mutual fund and ETF industry?
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.800]   Sure. I think it's a picture of a vibrant industry, but there's a dichotomy for sure.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.820]   When you look at what's growing and what's contracting. So let's start with what's growing.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:16.860]   Indexing writ large is growing. ETFs is a category within indexing is growing. And then even within
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.120]   ETFs, you're seeing active investing growing, which is probably something maybe we'll touch upon a little
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.760]   bit later in the conversation because that's a burgeoning area. And then what's on the flip side?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.420]   It's basically the opposite of each one of those things. You're seeing active in many areas
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.680]   contract. You're seeing open-end funds as a category shrink further. And the convergence of
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.200]   those two things, active mutual funds have really been under siege in recent years. So it's an industry
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.480]   that continues to grow. And in fact, just by virtue of the market, even active open-end mutual funds
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.520]   have seen growth, despite the fact that some of them have seen prodigious outflows over time.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.800]   But you're seeing some real puts and takes.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:14.400]   So let's get into the numbers here. How many mutual funds have been created versus how many ETFs have
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.660]   been created, say, over the past three years since I had you won last?
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.500]   Okay. So in terms of mutual funds that have been created over the last three years,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.900]   around 1,300 have been created.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.060]   Does that include money market funds, too?
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.320]   No. I'm sorry. I should have mentioned that. So that's just sort of your traditional sort of stock
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.060]   bond allocation funds. No money markets included in that. And then if you're to focus on ETFs,
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.460]   there were around 1,700 ETFs that were created over the last three years. So you've seen more creation
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.740]   within the ETF industry than you have in the fund industry. And so probably something you're
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.940]   wondering about, what about the converse, you know, the number of funds that have been mothballed.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:07.620]   And this is pretty striking. So with respect to open-end mutual funds, around 4,400 have been merged or
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.900]   liquidated away in the last three years compared to 642 ETFs.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.140]   Wow.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.900]   And so it's a picture of an ETF industry that continues to expand, not only by assets, but in terms of
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.540]   net number of vehicles. And then with respect to open-end funds, you're actually seeing the industry
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.620]   contract. There were a number of years, as you well know, where the industry was growing like wildfire,
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.180]   both in terms of assets, as well as in terms of number of funds. But it's actually been shrinking
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.340]   in recent years. And you could argue that that's an industry that's adapting
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.420]   to a more sobering set of conditions than it faced in the past.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.780]   So I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Open-end funds, traditional open-end funds,
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.020]   whether it's indexed funds or actively managed funds. 1,300 approximately have been created
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.460]   in the last three years and 4,400 have closed?
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.900]   That's correct.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.700]   Wow. That is a huge number. Did it include different share classes like A-share, B-share,
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.740]   Z-share, I-share? Are those part of the 4,400?
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.780]   Indeed, it did. So this is all share classes. And so you're right that some of this can be
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.620]   share class consolidation, of which there has been some. At the margins, there can also be a little bit
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.300]   of open-end ETF conversion activity that you might have seen take place in the last three years that's
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.060]   picked up a little bit. That's more of a rounding error in that number. It's more about the economics of
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.740]   running money in the open-end format. A lot of these, they're smaller in size, or they just want to tidy
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.660]   up their lineup, close some share classes so that they can gain a little bit of scale across a fund's
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.780]   various share classes. But yeah, the open-end fund industry is in contraction.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.300]   You did mention something I want to bring up here, and that is converting from a traditional
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.980]   open-end fund to an ETF. How many funds have done that? And is that a growing trend?
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.900]   It is a growing trend. In terms of numbers, I don't have it right in front of me, but we're talking
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.380]   about hundreds of funds that have been converted. Hundreds, wow.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.780]   Yeah, there's been a good number of them. What we have tended to find, with a few exceptions,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.620]   is that the traditional fund providers, who are the ones that are typically converting these,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:36.740]   they are picking and choosing which they're going to convert. So they might have a colossus of a fund
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:43.860]   within their lineup, but it might have a lot of assets in the retirement channel, or it might be spread
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.020]   across a multitude of different share classes. In circumstances like those, it doesn't facilitate
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:58.180]   conversion because you can't have an ETF in a 401k plan, or it's just a logistical nightmare to go and
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.860]   basically consolidate the multiple share class assets into a single share class so that it can be converted
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.580]   to an ETF. So what it's tended to mean is that fund companies have been more picky about what they
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.820]   convert. But we have seen some large fund families that have converted, probably most notably Dimensional,
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.100]   has converted a number of their mutual funds, and that's real money. There's been significant,
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.780]   we're talking billions of dollars in assets that have converted. JP Morgan is another name that springs
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.580]   to mind. But then we've also seen some traditional, very large open-end active players who've opted to go
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.940]   a different route, just launching DeNovo, like good examples of that. Probably the most prominent would be
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:46.420]   capital group, capital group, also known as American funds. They brought out a number of active ETFs,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:54.020]   and those are not conversions. A few years ago, Vanguard held this patent on being able to launch
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:09:02.900]   an ETF share class against their traditional open-end funds. That's how VTI, the total stock market ETF,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:10.500]   and VTSAX, which is the total stock market fund, are the same fund, just different share classes. And for
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:17.540]   many years, almost 20 years, Vanguard owned a patent on this, and no one else could do it. That came off
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:25.460]   patent, I want to say, a couple of years ago. And I've seen a lot of companies doing that. Is that something
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.140]   that's a trend? Not yet. Because I believe that we've got a number of fund companies that have applied
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.980]   to the SEC to do this. My colleague Ben Johnson has done a really good job of chronicling this. I think
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.940]   there's dozens of fund companies at this point. But what we have typically seen the traditional active
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:50.820]   providers do is either convert, like we had talked about before, or they will just bring out sort of a
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:57.860]   version of an active strategy that they offer, but it will not be a just sort of a new share class that
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.580]   sprouts from the existing fund, if that makes sense. So if you've got like a fund that's got like four or
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.020]   five share classes to it, we're not yet seeing them at that fifth or sixth share class, the fifth or sixth
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:15.380]   being an ETF. It's a new offering essentially that resembles maybe the traditional open-end fund
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.340]   that they offer, but isn't an exact replica like you would have if they just sort of sprouted a new
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.020]   share class. And is that because it's still in SEC registration, and the SEC is working on it,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.740]   and that's the reason why this hasn't happened? That's right. But I know that it's awaiting regulatory
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.740]   approval. I think that there's also an operational dimension to this for some fund companies. But as Ben
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.540]   has done a really good job of chronicling, that hasn't stopped many of them from going and applying
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.980]   for this, notwithstanding whatever sort of operational hurdles might stand in their way,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.740]   clearly they feel like they can surmount those challenges. Let's look at some of these new offerings.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:11:00.660]   I'm a casual observer of some of these new ETFs that are coming out, and there are a lot of
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:12.820]   interesting ones. Very niche, very specific, even single-stock ETFs leveraged. So let's go ahead and
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:20.820]   start at the top of the three categories that I found. The first one is thematic funds. It seemed to be
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:27.620]   very popular. Yep. So thematic funds, you're quite right. That has been a very popular category. I would
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:35.380]   say it peaked a few years ago back, probably 2021. I think that we saw 57 thematic ETFs launch it since
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:43.380]   tapered off a bit. For instance, in the last year ended February 25, there were only 17 new thematic
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:49.460]   ETFs that were launched. So it's definitely cooled down. And I think that's attributable to a couple of
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.620]   things. I mean, one is, I think the industry maybe got shook out a little bit. 2022, by the market downturn,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.900]   which hit some of these strategies really hard, and even some of them hit a harder times even before
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:07.220]   that. I think the other factor is investors have had some difficulties using these successfully. I did
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.980]   a little bit of work on this a month or so ago, looking at how the average dollar invested in thematic
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.060]   strategies had done over a period of time. I think I looked at the trailing three years, maybe as of
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.900]   January. And what I found is that the average dollar had lost money, despite the fact that it was a
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:31.220]   pretty hospitable market climate. What's more, you found that the average dollar in thematics,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:38.340]   not only did it lose money, but it badly lagged how the average dollar had done in just a plain old
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:44.740]   target date 2050 fund. You know, I picked a 2050 because it's a lot of 25, 30 year time horizon,
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:50.340]   which mimics what you'd see with a thematic. And those made good money. It was like 67%. So it was
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.420]   basically a 14% per annum difference in the return to the average dollar of a thematic.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.860]   And I, so I think the fact that, you know, you've had these very divergent sort of experiences,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:05.540]   sort of rates of success in thematics, that probably also has induced some of the slowdown
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:12.340]   that we've seen in those, but they're a big category. They have at last count around $113 billion
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.660]   in net assets in thematic ETFs. And so the fact that there's a good amount of money there,
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.980]   there's been some legs of growth to it. It'll continue to attract some activity, which we've seen,
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.260]   like I said, 17 of these launched in the last year. A lot of times these thematic funds, which might be
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:34.500]   artificial intelligence or that, whatever the theme is, the investment theme is of the fund,
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.540]   there's a lag. I mean, it gets hot, it gets popular. I've been, I've been around the industry
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:48.260]   for almost 40 years now, and it's constant, right? If something is hot, then a fund eventually gets
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.300]   created, but it does take time to get the offering through the SEC.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.260]   Exactly.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:01.700]   So by the time the fund launches, the shooting star is beginning to burn out in a way.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.780]   That's right. Exactly. By the time it gets to you, by the time it resonates with you,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.180]   I mean, that story might have been played out. Those of us that have been inculcated in sort
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:18.180]   of passive investing and market efficiency, even in perfect forms of it, I think that one of the first
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.660]   questions we go to is, well, why wouldn't this have already been priced in, right? And so I think that's
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.620]   one of the difficulties that investors in these products have encountered. And just to, so it's a
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.980]   little bit less abstract. I mean, just looking at the top products, China internet, cyber security,
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.700]   US infrastructure, Dow Jones internet, arc innovation, which is probably the most famous of these medical
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:48.900]   devices, cloud computing, exponential technologies. I mean, these are the sorts of stories that basically
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.460]   make up these types of strategies. And in most of these instances, at the time they launched,
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.740]   that was a story that kind of had entered the zeitgeist, had its hold on a segment of the market,
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.540]   and yet it was probably already priced in and then some. And that's why it hasn't conferred the sort of
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.820]   outsized returns that maybe one would have thought it would have given how hot these themes were at the
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.700]   relevant times.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.940]   Hmm. Solar energy, cannabis companies, all of that.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.420]   That's right. Uranium, artificial intelligence, which you mentioned,
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:25.380]   water resources, quantum investing, if we can even call it that. These are all examples of thematic
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.580]   strategies one would find.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:33.860]   I remember reading a book about fidelity years ago, it was published, must have been 35 years ago,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.820]   with the authors quoted. I think it was Ned Johnson who said, you know, if the public will buy it,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.020]   we will create it, but I wouldn't put a dime of my own money in it.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.380]   Yep. No, no, for sure. And I think I did maybe write a little bit about this in the piece that I wrote,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.020]   the headline of which is that the average dollar in these thematics had badly lagged,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:16:01.620]   the average dollar in target date 2050s. If you're going to do it, and it seems strange to say this,
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.380]   you want to be a bit contrarian about it. Like if you believe in the theme, you've done your homework,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.820]   you think that there's some durability to it. Well, probably the time to get in is after it sells
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:19.460]   off. And it's more invitingly priced, not when it's basically cocktail party chatter, that sort of thing.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:29.860]   Very good. The next group leveraged ETS. And these can get very specific, like 2X, 3X up, 2X, 3X down,
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.380]   and even get into single stocks. This is getting to be popular.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:42.100]   Yes. To say this category would leave Bogleheads colds is, I think, the understatement of all
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:48.500]   understatements. So yeah. So maybe a few facts and figures that I'll hang on this one. There were,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:58.980]   last year, dozens of leveraged ETFs come out. And why did the number pick up? Because one of the
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:05.380]   emerging trends that we've seen in that space is single stock leveraged ETFs. So think of
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:14.020]   Nvidia, think of MicroStrategy. I mean, typically, these are kind of growth names. They've got some
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:21.860]   curb appeal to them. And they attract the trading crowd. And that's really what these ETFs are designed
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:28.500]   to appeal to. And so, but the new wave in these have been single stock leveraged ETFs. You know,
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.900]   this is something else I wrote a little bit about. There was a piece that went up a bit,
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.420]   just, you know, focusing on, this was as of early February, the sorts of results
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:43.140]   that it looked like investors had seen in products like these, again, focused on the average dollar,
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.300]   which is sort of an internal rate of return calculation, dollar weighted return calculation.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.660]   And what you found is if you actually took the reference assets, whether it's a single stock,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:18:00.580]   like it could be an ETF, more commonly, it's an index, and you just basically ran their return
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:08.660]   without the leverage, you only earned about five percentage points more in these products than
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.140]   would have the underlying assets without any of the leverage and certainly with far
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.180]   less volatility. So granted, these are not really built for somebody that's going to hold for a
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.460]   year, which was the time period that I examined in my study. But I think it does underscore the fact
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:30.900]   that there's real issues with these. The providers, they certainly disclose that these are designed
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.100]   for a single day, and you should not expect to be able to earn some multiple over periods longer than
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.780]   a day. So they're fulfilling their obligation. But you know, it does seem that that probably there are
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.260]   there are investors who stick in these for longer than that. And they probably are doing so to their
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.060]   detriment because there's more volatility. There's certainly more fee.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:55.860]   I do see that when a new person comes to me and I look and see what they own. Occasionally, I'll see
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:07.700]   a 2x or 3x. And they've held it for quite a while. And their rate of return isn't 2x or 3x because
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:16.020]   there's also 2x and 3x volatility. And when you compound volatility, you erode away whatever excess
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:24.500]   return there is. That's right. The SEC has put out multiple advisories to investors on these funds,
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:30.820]   and even put out warnings to broker-dealers, because I remember in the past some broker-dealers got in
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.540]   trouble for not telling the clients how risky these things are. Just be careful with these things.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:43.220]   They are meant for one day, which is really a bit strange because it really kind of circumvents the
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:48.820]   margin laws. You could leverage something within a fund without actually having to have a margin
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:54.580]   account. It's not something Bogleheads probably would be investing in, although I have seen a few of them
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:03.940]   in accounts. The last category I want to discuss is private equity inside an ETF. And the big one is
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.740]   SpaceX, right? Now you can own SpaceX if you buy this ETF, even though SpaceX doesn't trade. You wrote some on this.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:18.100]   So this is maybe one of the hottest themes going, the public-private convergence. For the record,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.620]   I don't have an issue with the notion of investor investing in both public and private, as long as they
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:31.060]   understand the associated trade-offs. What's been new is ETFs and open-end funds entering this space. The
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.020]   reason why it has not been common to this point, as we know, these are daily liquidity vehicles. They
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:41.300]   need to be able to fulfill buy and sell orders. And so what that means is that the underlying securities
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.900]   they invest in need to be sufficiently liquid and have readily ascertainable market values. And that doesn't
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.940]   really describe private equity or private credit for that matter. And my colleagues, especially Jack
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:57.380]   Shannon, have done lots of work on open-end funds that have owned stakes in private equity. Some of the
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.620]   big complexes, Fidelity, T-Row, and the like, they do have positions in private equity in their open-end funds,
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.260]   but they have tended to be at the margins. And Jack has done a really good job of covering that for us
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:16.740]   over time, as did Katie Reichert before him. I focused on a newer ETF. It's called ER shares, private public
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:24.660]   crossover ETF. The ticker is XOVR. And what's notable about what it's doing is it is committed to investing
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:33.620]   more meaningfully in private equity up to the 15% limit on a liquids. And to do so, it took a sizable stake in
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:42.900]   SpaceX. It's around 11% of its net assets. And that's a pretty chunky position in an illiquid for
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.660]   an ETF to have. And so what I try to do with the piece is just kind of go through the progression to
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.180]   ask the questions that I would think somebody that's diligently a product like that would ask themselves,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:01.380]   which I think it's probably advisable for us to all ask as this sort of trend plays its way through
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:07.300]   open-end funds in ETFs. It's questions like, how do they access and transact in the private equity
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.940]   securities concerned? How do they value it? How do they manage the associated liquidity risk?
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.980]   I mean, when you're kicking the tires on vehicles like those, there should be sort of satisfactory
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.580]   answers that are forthcoming on each of those questions. But I was having a hard time with that
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.780]   particular ETF and kind of getting at the answers to those things. So that's why I wrote the piece.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:35.860]   But it's a hot area. There's, as you know, there's a new SSGA ETF. It's a partnership with Apollo
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:42.740]   that will invest meaningfully in private credit. That's just getting off the ground. It was recently
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.260]   approved. And so all eyes are on that to see sort of how this experiment will play out in practice. But
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:57.940]   that has been a much talked about area. I recall back in the 1990s, a fund manager by the name of
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:07.300]   Garrett Von Wagner, who was very successful growth stock manager and started to left the company he was
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:18.180]   with, started his own group of growth stock mutual funds. And he did this. He put private equity in a
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:27.060]   mutual fund. The problem was, there's no valuation model where you could say this is what the daily
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:35.540]   value of the value of private equity was because it's private equity. So he didn't trade. And the SEC
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:43.860]   called him out on it. And without admitting anything, he paid the SEC something like a $600,000 fine
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.140]   because it was the contention of the SEC that he was mispricing
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.300]   these private equities in the fund. And it was an open-to-end fund. So that was a problem because
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.940]   that means the people who were buying the fund would be paying too much. And the people who were
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.980]   selling the shares would be getting too much. So it wasn't a fair market. Do you recall that by any
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.260]   chance? It predates my arrival at Morningstar, but I certainly have have read about it and familiar
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:16.340]   with it. It's a pretty sort of famous example episode within the industry. Yeah, I could see that coming
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:23.780]   around again here with what we're seeing today, but we'll see. All right. So Jeff, I mean, is there
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:29.380]   anything else that you're seeing out there? Any other area that ETFs are being created?
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:36.500]   You know, I would say the other thing that our team and our manager research team is led globally
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:43.220]   by my colleague, Laura Lutton. One thing that they're really focused on is as categories. One is
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:49.620]   sort of in the public private realm. We're seeing quite a bit of activity in the interval fund space.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:55.460]   And interval funds, not my cup of tea. You know, I like my managed investments to be liquid. That's
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.780]   not what interval funds are meant to be. At least they're not fully liquid, like an ETF.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.380]   What are interval funds?
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:07.060]   They're sort of a hybrid between an open-end fund and a closed-end fund. A closed-end fund,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.020]   as I think many of your listeners might know, it's different from an open-end fund in that
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:18.420]   they don't issue new shares when demand exceeds supply. The number of shares is fixed. And so
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.700]   closed-end funds, they're probably most notorious for trading away from their net asset value. There
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.420]   can be a premium or commonly there's discounts. And so that's one of the trade-offs that you face.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:34.020]   They've typically been used to invest in less liquid assets and also because they can employ leverage more
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:40.420]   freely. They've been used for income-generative types of strategies just because you can sort of
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.380]   gear up your yield and deliver more income to your investors. That's one of the reasons why they've attracted
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.420]   investors, but they're closed. Again, you can't create new shares. Interval funds are a little bit different
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:58.340]   in that they have a little bit more latitude to create additional demand and also typically in a quarterly or
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:04.740]   maybe a semi-annual interval. They will basically tender for a certain percentage of the shares.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.300]   Yeah. So it's almost like a combination between an ETF and a closed-day fund.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:16.180]   Exactly. This has become an area where there's quite a bit of activity because it's conducive,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:22.180]   I think, in the minds of many to investing in privately held assets, but to offer a little
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.100]   bit more liquidity than you would typically have if you went the usual route of directly investing in
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:31.860]   private securities or investing, say, through a private equity or a private credit fund.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:40.100]   A lot of private equity has a limit to the amount of redemption that can occur in any quarter and then
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.860]   it stops. Do these funds have that same limit?
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:50.740]   They do. They limit it and so that's what makes them more conducive to holding private assets.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.060]   Yeah, but everybody runs for the door at the same time when they need liquidity.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:01.460]   So pensions, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments who have a lot of
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:07.780]   private equity that's illiquid. What do they start selling when they need money? They start selling
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.020]   the public stuff and then eventually they get to the point where they've got to dump something else.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.380]   It could be a fire drill here. Everybody rushes to the door at the same time and then you can't get out.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:24.260]   You got it. Yeah. So that's, that's definitely one of the more salient trade-offs that I think an
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.860]   investor in these would want to consider is, you know, you might feel pretty laid back sanguine about
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.140]   not needing the money right now, but when the market experiences some tumult, you might feel very,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.740]   very differently. And so may many of your co-investors in the strategy. So it's certainly
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.460]   something that they need to bear in mind before they plunk their money into it. The other thing with intervals
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.820]   is, and our team will go through and diligence these using a similar methodology at the appointed
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:56.420]   time to what we do for open-end funds and ETFs. They can be very, very expensive and it's not uncommon
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:03.380]   for them to utilize pretty large dollops of leverage, which obviously have trade-offs associated with it.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.460]   So it's the sort of thing where, you know, probably buyer beware applies and, and our team led by Laura
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.300]   Lutton will go through and, and they'll diligence these in the same way they do the other types
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.340]   of products that they evaluate, trying to make sure that they hold them to the same high standards.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.540]   You wrote a piece recently,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:28.580]   Vanguard's Jack Bogle was right again, because what you looked at was
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:38.500]   trading, the amount of trading that goes on between ETFs and mutual funds. And you found that mutual
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:45.380]   funds, there is less trading ETFs, there is more trading, and that had certain results. Can you talk
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:54.340]   about that study? For sure. The proxy that I was using for trading was the volatility of net flows to equity
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:29:02.100]   ETFs. And, and what I found by that measure is that trading in equity ETFs is about three times
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:11.460]   as volatile as trading in open-end mutual funds. And so, you know, we've long studied the relationship
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.140]   between investor activity and the sort of outcomes that they achieve. And sort of the way we try to
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.900]   measure that is through an internal rate of return, a dollar weighted return of calculation in our
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.740]   power balance, it's an investor return, it's how much the average dollar does. And long story short,
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:32.660]   so I took a look at this big picture, and then more specific to Vanguard, what I found was that
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:42.020]   from a time weighted a total return standpoint, equity ETFs were earning just as much as open-end funds,
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:48.100]   in fact, a little bit more. By time weighted, you simply mean ignoring cash flows, you're just
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.940]   looking at the actual return of the fund, it didn't matter how much money was coming in or going out.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.540]   Exactly right. I should have clarified that. Yeah. So it's assuming a buy and hold investment. You
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.740]   invest a lump sum at the beginning, you hold it to the end. And so it's agnostic to the timing and
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:10.820]   magnitude of investor cash flows along the way. And so what you found on that basis is that ETFs actually,
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:16.020]   equity ETFs, I should say, over the, I think, 10 year period I looked at ended January 2025,
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.380]   they were slightly out earning comparable open-end funds over that period of time, which is kind of
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.300]   what you would expect. They're a little bit cheaper. However, when you looked at them on a
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.660]   dollar weighted basis, and so this does take into account the timing and magnitude of investor cash flows,
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:37.460]   what you found is that they were actually lagging comparable equity, open-end mutual funds. This is
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:44.020]   true for the industry at large. It was also true for Vanguard. They weren't capturing as much of the
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.940]   potential buy and hold that is total return that they could have earned. Well, there's no smoking gun with
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:56.180]   these things we can't know whether that's directly attributable to over transacting. You know,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:03.940]   circumstantially, it does lead you to conclude that some of the trading activity that we've seen
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:12.180]   in ETFs has been detrimental in the sense that their average return in equity ETFs hasn't been
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.020]   as high as it could have been if they had traded less, which is sort of what you see in open-end
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:23.460]   mutual funds. And like I said, found this not only for equity ETFs and mutual funds for the industry
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:29.700]   as a whole, but also for Vanguard more specifically. The good news for Vanguard investors is the gap that
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   I saw for ETFs between the total return of the dollar weighted return was narrower than what I saw in the
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.460]   ETF industry as a whole. And even when you looked at the average dollars return in the equity ETFs that
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.980]   Vanguard offered, they still exceeded that. The return of the average dollar for the industry as
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:52.900]   a whole. So those are things that I think Mogul, if I could presume, would have felt good about.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.220]   You know, he's a very competitive guy, wanted to beat the competition.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.100]   Vindicated. He would have felt vindicated. I can see him now, right? That's exactly what I said.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.780]   Why didn't anybody listen to me? Right?
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   Yeah, you can hear it, right?
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:14.420]   It was the reason why Jack turned down the idea of doing an S&P 500 ETF back in the mid-1990s. Great
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.740]   idea, but he didn't want to get involved. He saw ETFs as pouring gasoline on a fire.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   One thing I would add though, to be fair to Vanguard, and it may reassure a few of your listeners,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:31.300]   we don't typically publish gap data between dollar weighted returns and total returns for particular fund
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.900]   families. But when I've studied this just on my own time, what I have found is that the gap
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.580]   for Vanguard funds and ETFs has been meaningfully narrower. And so what that means is that Vanguard
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:48.100]   fund investors are earning more of their funds' total returns. A different way, I suppose, to put
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:54.580]   that is they're doing a better job of timing their cash flows or just being disciplined than we're
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.940]   seeing elsewhere in the industry. And so that's to their credit.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:04.980]   Talking about cash flows, we've got 1,300 mutual funds created, 1,700 ETFs created
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:09.140]   in the last three years, although there's been a lot of mutual funds that have closed,
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:15.220]   a lot less ETFs that have closed. We've got all these funds, but where is the big money going?
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:21.060]   Okay, so I'll run through them, sort of the broad categories. So it's going to indexing,
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:31.540]   it's going to ETFs, and it's going to Vanguard and BlackRock primarily. They're hoovering up cash at an
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:37.300]   almost historic rate. And we can get into the specifics here, but maybe I'll focus on the trailing
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:47.060]   year ended February. So with respect to ETFs, they saw $1.2 trillion in net inflows. And so I think for
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:54.900]   the year 2024 was the biggest ever for ETFs, 1.1 trillion of net inflows. And so that's equivalent
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.460]   to a 14% organic growth rate.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.740]   Well, this is inflows. This is not gain in the market. This is actual new cash coming in.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:09.460]   That's correct. Exactly. So again, that was $1.1 trillion of net inflows last year, which was
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:17.780]   equivalent to around 14% of what would have been the beginning net assets in the US ETF industry at the
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:25.220]   start of that year. And contrast that with open end funds. Last year, they shrank by around 2% of their
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:32.100]   beginning net assets. So it was around half a trillion dollars in outflows, give or take over the course of
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:38.020]   last year for open end funds. So you've really seen a sea change. And this is just the past year that trend
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:45.540]   has been playing itself out. The ETF industry at this point, for those who are wondering, it's a nearly $11 trillion
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.560]   industry.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.640]   Open end funds, believe it or not, despite the fact that we've seen this torrent of flows out of
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:35:01.080]   open end funds into ETFs, it's still a $21 trillion industry. So when you look at the market share of
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:08.760]   open end funds versus ETFs, it's still about two to one open end fund assets to ETF assets. Open end funds
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:16.600]   still have about two thirds of the market compared to the ETFs, one third. I mentioned index versus active
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:23.800]   being the other line of differentiation, kind of how it cleaves. As I mentioned, index is dominating. So if
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:32.280]   you're to focus on the year ended February, $918 billion of net inflows into index funds, and that's
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.680]   what's going to be the other year. It's going to be the other year that's going to be the other year.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.560]   Wow.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:44.600]   2024 was the second biggest year for index funds on record. It was a very, very historic year when it
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:51.240]   came to ETFs and index funds more generally gathering assets from investors.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:57.720]   You know, sort of the more popular categories for discretionary active ETFs, in case you were
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:05.160]   wondering about that, were ultra short bond, large blend, derivative income, which is sort of like,
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:12.520]   you can think of that as sort of covered call, sort of option writing strategies, core plus bond in large
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.720]   value. That's where we've seen sort of the active ETFs come to the fore. We've seen more launches in that area
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.280]   in the past few years than we have for some others.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.080]   But have they gathered assets? Are they just launching these things with the hope of stopping
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:36.280]   the flow out of their actively managed mutual funds? We may be cannibalizing our own open end funds,
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.880]   but at least we'll be stopping the flow going to somewhere else. So I mean, are these things attracting
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.920]   meaningful assets?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:50.760]   Yeah, that's a great question. The short answer is they are. So 2024 was a banner year for active ETFs.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:56.280]   They saw around $290 billion in inflows, according to our estimate.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:56.680]   Wow.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:04.520]   Over the past three years, they saw around $560 billion of inflows, which is equivalent to around
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:13.000]   24% of all flows that we saw to ETFs. And so like the biggest ones that you would see are the bestsellers.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.200]   So there's a Janice Henderson, AAA CLO ETF, which I think has seen around $15
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:26.760]   billion in flows over the last three years. I think I mentioned JEPI, which is the JP Morgan
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.160]   equity premium income ETF. There's a NASDAQ version, which has been a hot seller. And then Fidelity
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   has an active bond product, Fidelity total bond ETF, which has also been hot selling as well.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:41.720]   You know, this has definitely been an area of real interest and activity for the providers,
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:48.200]   as you can imagine, and it's paid off by some measures. So let's get into the active versus
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:48.760]   passive.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.280]   We chart comparisons.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:38:00.440]   And by passive, I'd like to stick with Jack Bogle's view of a traditional index fund versus
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:11.160]   a, what I call a Spindex, which is a special purpose index fund. And call it a, you know,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.720]   a NVIDIA 2X. You've done a lot of work. Morningstar has always done a lot of work,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   as have other companies on active versus passive. You just recently have come out with your annual
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:32.680]   report looking at 2024 and previous to that going back many, many years. What's going on? Are these
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   newfangled ideas that are coming out in ETF format? Are they outperforming? What is going on in the
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.480]   active versus passive debate? Yeah, great question. So we did put out a report recently. We call it
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.640]   the active passive barometer. My colleagues, Brian Armour, Ryan Jackson, Eugene Gorbatikov,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   and Human Kim put it out. And it looks at active fund success rates versus a style-appropriate
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:00.120]   passive composite over different trailing periods. To answer your question, Rick, we're seeing far more
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.760]   failure than we are success, especially as you look at the longer period. So just to give you an example
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:13.560]   for the U.S. large cap categories, only about 6% of active U.S. large blend funds beat their passive
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.640]   composite composite over the 10-year period and to December 2024. For large value, it was around 14%.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:27.240]   And for large growth, it was only 3%. And so those are very, very sobering figures indeed. As you range
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.120]   out to some of the other areas, you would have seen the success rates perk up a bit. For instance,
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:40.280]   as you move towards small cap, you're talking about 20% to 30% of active small cap funds that started
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.640]   the period survive to the end and beat their passive composite. But that's still less than
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.440]   a coin flips chance. Where you do see the success rates get meaningfully better, at least in relative
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   terms, is within active bond funds. And so as you move to areas like intermediate corporate bonds,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.560]   high yield bonds, that's where the success rates can approach 50%. But again, in a number of these cases,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.440]   you're talking about a coin flips chance for many investors, they'll conclude that's not good enough
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:16.040]   odds, and they'll opt to index, which I think for many investors is advisable anyway. But it's an excellent
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:21.960]   report my colleagues put out. It is. You do a great job with this. It's hard to categorize some of these funds,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:29.720]   but I mean, you do the best that you can do. I would like to point out a couple of things. As you go further out,
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.880]   I mean, time is not on your side, right? I mean, over a one year period, it might be some years 60%
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:42.200]   of active outperformed, some years 40, some years less. But as you move out to five years, the number
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:47.000]   drops. You also have a survivorship bias. I mean, a lot of funds just close, and so they're not included
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.560]   in the data anymore. And the only data you can include is the funds that's still around, and maybe
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.000]   the funds that were around before they closed, you can include that data. But once you go out to
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.400]   10 years, the percentages drop even more. 15 years, they tend to drop more. And by 20 years, you're really,
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:10.000]   really dropping. And I found this to be true, regardless of the period of time you're looking at. It could be the
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.880]   last 20 years. You could start in 2000, looking backwards 20 years. You could start in 1980, look backwards 20 years.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:23.960]   And these numbers are very consistent. The longer you hold your active funds, the lower the probability they will
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.720]   outperform the index. And you talk about that phenomenon, that recurring phenomenon.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   Oh yeah, for sure. No, I think that point's really well taken. I would say the common denominator across
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:41.480]   all these different time periods that we might have measured, you know, going back in time, funds come
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.440]   and they go. My colleague found that, you know, over a typical 10-year time horizon,
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:54.360]   30 to 40, in some cases, even 50% of the active funds that began the period did not survive to the
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:00.280]   end of the period. And so, the common thread here is sort of the perishability of some of these active
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.040]   funds. That plays a large part in explaining why success rates aren't higher than they are. I'm not
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:13.320]   suggesting that they would necessarily be markedly better, even if all of these active funds that die in
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.480]   droves were to somehow survive to the end. There's a number of other factors that probably portend
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:26.680]   against that. But nevertheless, one of the overarching factors in why active funds have struggled to beat
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.160]   their passive composites in greater numbers is the fact that they just don't make it to the end. They
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:38.520]   don't have the staying power. The other thing I wanted to bring up about the data is that you mentioned in the
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   last 10 years bond funds, if you bought an actively managed bond fund, it's maybe a coin flip. You've
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:51.960]   got a 50-50 chance of outperforming the bond index. However, I do want to point this out about the
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:43:02.600]   difference between bond funds and stock funds, is that when you look at the range of returns of the stock
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:10.040]   stock funds over that 10-year period, it's an 80 percentile of the funds fall into a very wide range,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:16.600]   like 5% between the ones that do come close to beating the market or even maybe beat it by a little
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:25.720]   bit, and the ones on the other side of the chart that underperform that 80 percentile. It's a wide range,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:34.200]   like 5% difference. But that's not the case with bond funds. Bond funds is a very narrow, peaky
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:41.400]   graph, where the ones that outperform might outperform by a half a percent. The ones that
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:47.320]   underperform, underperform by maybe a half a percent. And if you just bought the index,
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:53.000]   which is in the middle, you did just fine. So if you're going to try to beat the market,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.320]   and you want to beat it meaningfully, and you're trying to do it in a balanced portfolio,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.360]   it becomes very difficult because the equity side of that has a very low probability of outperforming.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:10.280]   And you could underperform by an awful lot. So if you have a three-fund portfolio of U.S. stock,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.080]   international stock, and bonds, you could pick three actively managed funds. The bonds might actually
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.440]   do okay. They might outperform by a half. But if one of your stock funds underperforms by three percent,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.280]   I mean, you just blew the whole thing out of the water, and you should have just had three index
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.560]   funds. No, I think that's exactly right. If we look at this on two different axes, one being likelihood
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:36.280]   of success, the other being expected payoff, I suppose. Like you say, what you would find is that
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:42.840]   you probably have a lower likelihood of success in equity, albeit with maybe a larger potential payoff,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.960]   should it survive to the end and actually beat the passive composite, should it do so. Whereas
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:53.320]   with fixed income funds, there might be a slightly higher chance to succeed to beat the passive
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.760]   composite. But as you say, it's not going to do a moonshot. You're not going to get this huge payoff
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:04.120]   where it's beating the benchmark by multiple percentage points. If it's doing so, you actually
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.280]   probably want to diligence further just to make sure you understand your strategy and why there's
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.680]   that sort of tracking error to it, because it can obviously go the opposite way. So you should be
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.960]   thinking of it along both of those dimensions, as you rightly point out.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.680]   I wrote about this in a book called The Power of Passive Investing, and I said the same thing. It's like,
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:25.240]   you might be able to pick one fund out of three that outperforms, but unless that outperforms by a lot,
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:31.640]   your portfolio still underperforms. So just do all index funds, and you have a high probability of
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:39.160]   outperforming a portfolio of active funds. I do want to get to a couple more items. And you did a lot of work on
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:47.160]   active funds again, but here looking beyond the fee. Clearly, everyone agrees that active funds have
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.960]   higher fees, and you have to get over that hurdle rate first. But your research even went in a little
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:00.440]   bit deeper, at least recently, that says, well, you know, if you buy the past performing funds that have
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:08.200]   low fees, something might be there. Can you describe that? Yeah, so we took a look at what might be doing a
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.120]   good job of sorting based on future performance, as it were. And so we looked at a couple things. One
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:18.440]   was past performance before fees. The other was fees themselves. And what we actually found is that
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.800]   if you favor the funds that had the best past performance before fees, and then furthermore,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.480]   within that cohort, you favor the lowest cost, you greatly boosted your odds of success of beating
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.720]   your average peer over time. So I think for a lot of your listeners, they're already sort of well
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:41.080]   accustomed to sort of pinching pennies and favoring lower cost funds. I think that probably they would
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.200]   be less inclined to factor past performance in. But what our research found is that actually past
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:51.480]   performance before fees has done a more than respectable job in recent years of sorting funds
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:57.560]   based on past performers. Those which outperform before fees, this was across asset classes and across
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   years, were likely to outperform their average peer going forward than were the low performers in the
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:08.040]   past which tended to lag their average peer peer over future periods.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.280]   So the message is that if you are going to pick
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   a active fund, let's say you're in a 401k plan and they don't have any index funds, which would be
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:21.560]   very unusual, by the way, because most 401k plans at least have an S&P 500 now. But let's say you're in
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:29.640]   a 401k or 403b, you know, legacy thing that's really not good investment options. Then you should opt for
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:37.720]   the highest past performing active fund that has the lowest fee and that gives you the highest probability
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.200]   of at least getting maybe close to the market return, if not maybe outperforming.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.720]   I would start with fees. I think that's your best starting place. And my colleague Russ Kinnell did
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:54.280]   landmark research some years ago on which variables do the best job of predicting future fund net return
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   performance and fees shine through. And so if anything, I think the research that I did more recently
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.880]   builds very slightly on the work that Russ had done previously. But fees not only tilt the odds in your
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:13.640]   favor if you're looking at it versus other funds that are relevant peers, but also some of the more
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:19.000]   recent research I did, you know, I found that cheaper funds are likelier to survive over a longer time
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.160]   period than our pricier funds. So you also tilt the odds in your favor that way. Then secondarily,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:30.760]   you can look at performance, you know, we have tended to find in the last, you know, 10, 20 years,
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.520]   that past performance before fees has done a pretty good job of sorting. But I would start with fees. I
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.840]   think that that's the most reliable starting point. And certainly Russ found that some years ago.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:46.440]   I think I'd just make one last comment on past performance. It's been a momentum market in the
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:55.640]   last few years where the magnificent seven, you had to have them. And it's been that way for several years.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.920]   And active managers who did have them probably kept them at least a portion. In fact, you had an article
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.600]   on that talking about the portfolio construction of active funds, where they look a whole lot more
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.400]   like closet index funds than what the active managers would say. But the bottom line is there's been a
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.600]   lot of momentum in the market. Does some of that research about past performance have to do with recent
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.240]   momentum?
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:23.080]   Yeah, I think that's very astute. So I, I owe sort of our readers a follow up article to sort of dig into
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.640]   what some of the factors that explain it. But, but I think that you're keying on on some of the most
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:36.680]   important factors. We've seen an unusual persistence of large beating small of growth, beating value of
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:46.200]   domestic, beating foreign, of spread within fixed in, beating govy. These are areas which, in some cases, you'll see
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:53.880]   the best past performance having had favored, and they'll stick with that. And it's tended to reward them if
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.240]   they've stuck with those things. So yeah, there has been a certain pro cyclicality to it. And I think that explains
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:06.360]   some of the trended performance. But as we know, that can reverse itself quite dramatically in the markets. And so that's why I think,
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.200]   I think probably people are best served to start with cost rather than past performance.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.520]   Last area I want to get into is portfolio management. And just a couple of items here.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.000]   Sure.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:25.740]   A couple of reports that you did looking at the asset allocation of portfolios. And we tend to, I don't want to say we're trend
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:32.860]   followers. We, we are, but the fact is we are trend followers, at least to the point where we don't like to rebalance.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:39.460]   And that when U.S. equities are doing well, we tend to let that become a greater and greater portion of our portfolio
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:45.860]   than rebalancing, say, to international. Or if equities in general are doing better than bonds,
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.580]   or bonds are not doing well, so you really should be selling some stock and buying some more bonds,
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:56.180]   we tend to not do that. At least that's what I read from your data. Is that an accurate assessment?
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:01.860]   That is an accurate assessment. Inertia is very powerful. And on the flip side, it can be very
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:07.380]   uncomfortable. Indeed, when we go through a rebalance take from our strong performers and give to our weak
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:12.900]   performers, there's a natural aversion to doing so. It's incidentally, it's one of the reasons why
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:19.780]   I think that strategies which automate those tasks, like target date funds, like target risk funds,
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:26.020]   are so useful to investors. Certainly, there's probably an optimal solution out there, quote,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:33.700]   unquote, that could maybe carve the asset allocation more precisely, or do the rebalancing and reconstitution
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:39.220]   in a more tailor made way. But I don't think people should make perfect the enemy of good target date funds,
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:45.060]   target risk funds, are perfectly acceptable solutions. They help people to earn more of their
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:50.500]   funds, total returns to participate in markets, and to do so in a way that appropriately balances risk
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:57.700]   and opportunity. And so I think that helps you to overcome inertia, and there's no real action that's
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:02.500]   required on your part. But the research that we did recently, you know, in a sense, it tried to quantify
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:08.020]   some of that inertia. And what we did was we just went through and we tallied up all the assets by
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:13.780]   type of fund, and literally the securities that they held. And what we found that there was some drift
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:19.300]   into equities, US equities, large in particular, and away from some of the areas that haven't performed
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:26.020]   us strongly. So cash bonds, foreign stocks. And so, you know, when you kind of went through and sort of added
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:34.660]   it up, it was around we found $800 billion in assets that probably ought to be rebalanced, assuming certain
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:40.020]   things about what kind of the baseline allocation should be. It's not huge in percentage terms. I think
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:46.340]   we're talking about 3% of the equity allocation would need to be moved back into cash and bonds,
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:51.860]   let's say, and then within the equity sleeve a little bit of rejiggering around of the domestic to foreign
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:57.060]   split. You know, but it's real money in dollar terms. And we've seen in periods like the one
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:02.340]   we're coming off of that we can all get a little complacent as investors in doing some rebalancing
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:07.380]   and adjusting given our objectives and circumstances can be very much worthwhile. And this was our attempt
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:14.260]   to quantify that. One last question. We're talking about the creation of ETFs and target date funds.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:25.060]   I still am yet to see any kind of a push by the fund companies to create balanced ETFs, very low cost,
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:32.260]   balanced ETFs that do, let's say, a life strategy fund at Vanguard. In fact, Vanguard hasn't even created
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:40.100]   a life strategy ETF yet that we could use, say, in an IRA. Why is that? Do you have any idea?
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:45.780]   David Stein: So I think that probably just one practical operational reason is that target date
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:52.420]   funds, they've been used most often within the context of a 401k plan. The 401k plans,
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:58.180]   their pipes and plumbing aren't set up to hold ETFs. And so I suppose from that standpoint,
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:02.100]   if they're just to look at it as capitalists, they would conclude it's not worth their while to develop
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.140]   these because they can't put them in the place where they enjoy the most uptake. But I completely agree
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:14.180]   with you that from just from an overall investment utility standpoint, they make a great deal of sense.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.580]   David Stein: You know, particularly, you know, maybe they would need to get a little bit creative
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:24.820]   on the fixed income side. But if you think of taxable money, we know that equity ETFs, you know,
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.820]   they excel in keeping cap gains distributions to a minimum. In theory, you could deploy some of the fixed
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.620]   income sleeve into things like munis. Maybe they don't scale quite as well, but that would be a nice
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:42.900]   solution for taxable investors. In particular, I would warmly welcome target date and target risk ETFs.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:48.180]   Because like you said, I think they've got lots to offer investors. Simplicity is the key. And so as
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:53.460]   people move into ETFs, being able to offer them simpler, more ready made options like target date,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.660]   target risk ETFs, I think that would make a great deal of sense.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.620]   David Stein: Index ETFs, meaning, you know, very, very low cost, few basis points.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.900]   David Stein: Right. Well, Jeff, it's been wonderful having you back on Bogleheads
