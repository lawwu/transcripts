[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.320]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.720]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.240]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.600]   is.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   And today I want to learn everything I can about getting the cheapest flights.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   So today I'm talking to Scott Kyes of Scott's Cheap Flights, an email service
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.400]   he founded in 2013 that now has over 2 million members and helps them find
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.200]   incredible deals on flights every single day.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.640]   He's also the author of the bestselling book, Take More Vacations, a guide to
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.440]   search better, book cheaper and travel the world.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.200]   In our conversation, we'll walk through finding and booking the cheapest flights,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.320]   how to travel more and be happier.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.560]   What you need to do exactly when your flight gets canceled or delayed.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.680]   And Scott will share his Greek island trip, which doesn't just work for Greece,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.120]   but can save you over a thousand dollars on international trips.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.480]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   Well, after I play this obligatory reminder.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.960]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.920]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.120]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   investment decisions.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   Scott, thank you for being on the show.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.680]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.600]   Great to be with you, Chris.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.800]   And thanks for writing the book.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   I just read the book.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   So I actually binge read the book over the last two or three days and it's
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.280]   fantastic.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.960]   Well, listen, you're catching me not 12 hours after I got news that it hit the
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   national bestseller list.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.680]   So if I seem like I've got a little bit of a glow about me today, if there's a
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   little pep in my voice, that's why.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.840]   Wow.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   So now we upgrade the podcast.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   We're now talking to a national bestselling author.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.840]   I got to make sure we fix that in the intro.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.520]   I need to upgrade my self image, too.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.040]   You know, I thought, oh, you know, I just got no, no, I get to say I'm national
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.400]   bestseller.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.360]   Look, it feels something that's like I never could have imagined that this would
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.720]   happen.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.040]   So the amount of just gratitude for folks who went out and got the book and are
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.120]   excited to read it is endless on my part.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.760]   Well, congratulations.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   I think travel is one of the most incredible things you can do with your
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.240]   time.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.520]   So I love that you're helping make it easier.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.280]   How did you get into all of this?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.000]   It was very, very serendipitous.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.040]   You know, I was not one of those folks who always knew they wanted to be an
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.800]   entrepreneur, not one of the folks who was like, oh, I definitely want to, you
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   know, have a startup when I grow up and just looking for that million dollar
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.120]   idea.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   I was the exact opposite.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.720]   I never thought about getting into entrepreneurialism.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.040]   I was a journalist.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.520]   I was a political journalist based in DC and somebody who did not have much money
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.880]   in his bank account, but still wanted to be able to travel.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.840]   Like I wanted to be able to go over to Europe and go over to Asia and Africa.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.240]   And I knew that folks out there somehow were getting cheap flights, but every
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.680]   time I would look and every time I would search, it seemed like those flights were
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.720]   really expensive.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.520]   Like they were, you know, I mean, just, just ungodly sums of money that made
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.840]   international travel, frankly, out of the question for me until I started to
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.160]   really kind of immerse myself in this, you know, really kind of put on my
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   journalist hat.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.400]   Why are flights so volatile in price?
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.520]   Like, why is it that this, you know, flight will be expensive today and then
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.320]   cheap tomorrow and then really expensive the next day.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   I just threw myself into this world and it all culminated in 2013 when I got the
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.280]   best deal that I've ever gotten in my life, which was nonstop from New York
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   city to Milan for 130 bucks round trip.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.760]   Wow.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.200]   The funny thing about that flight was that I woke up that morning with zero
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.720]   intention of searching for flights to Milan, of booking a trip to Milan.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.240]   But when I stumbled across that deal, I mean, gosh, there's basically nowhere in
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.880]   the world I wouldn't go for 130 bucks round trip.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.840]   Right.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   And so I took this trip, had an amazing time, you know, and skiing in the Alps
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   and went hiking in Cinque Terre and I went to an AC Milan match.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   It was, it was awesome.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   When I got back from this trip, all my friends and coworkers kept coming up to
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   me, Hey, Scott, I heard about that great deal you got.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.680]   Hey, listen, next time you get a deal like that, can you let me know
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.040]   so I can get in on it too?
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.640]   And so rather than trying to remember every single person I was supposed to
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   let know next time I found a deal, I was like, why don't I just start a simple
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.480]   little email list and this way I can let everybody know at once.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.840]   And that's how, that's how Scott's cheap flights began.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.600]   But it was just, you know, for the first two years, it was just a hobby.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.480]   Just something I did for the love of the game until at one point in
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   2015, it had grown large enough.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.000]   Friends are telling friends, people were signing up.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.480]   They had grown large enough that this hobby of mine graduated out of the free
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.760]   tier of MailChimp and all of a sudden they started asking me for 50 bucks a
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   month to send emails about cheap flight alerts to my friends.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.760]   And so I was like, ah, I don't want to pay MailChimp 50 bucks just
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.880]   to do this thing I used to do.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.000]   But then it also dawned on me, wow, there's a real hunger for this thing.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.160]   There's a real demand for, for cheap flights, surprise.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.400]   And I wonder if there's a business opportunity here.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.920]   And so that in 2015 is when I first started exploring, how do I
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.720]   turn this into an actual company?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.760]   And how many people work at Scott's cheap flights now?
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.880]   Right now there's close to 40 people on the team, which is again, as somebody
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.960]   who never intended to start a company or become an entrepreneur is totally surreal.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.480]   And is that mostly, is that mostly people researching deals to try
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.640]   to create content for your, your emails?
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.040]   It's not, you know, we've got our flight search team is about six folks.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.720]   And then the rest of the team are, you know, people doing member success,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.360]   folks doing marketing, folks doing building the product and engineering
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.320]   and design all this, you know, run the gamut of, of different parts of the
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.000]   company, but the, the folks doing those flight searches and really kind of.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.200]   Keeping their eyes, that radar going for whenever cheap flights pop up.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.000]   I mean, that that's the real core of things because they are doing just
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   Yale, Yale person's work every single day to make sure that when those great
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.680]   deals do pop up, we don't miss them.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.040]   And our members don't miss them.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.360]   So, so I read the book and it dawned on me, right?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.720]   Your, your mission is take more vacations.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.760]   Why, why do you think people aren't taking more vacations?
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.760]   Yeah, this, so this was the central question that kind of prompted
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.280]   my curiosity to write this book.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.360]   Most of us, when you look at survey data and you ask folks, most of us say that
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.200]   we want to travel way more than we actually do, you know, and not only go
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.000]   up and ask somebody, would you like to take another vacation?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.760]   Absolutely.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.560]   But you see it in a new year's resolution data.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   One of the top things every single year, I want to travel more.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.280]   When you ask older folks, what do you wish you had done?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.240]   You know, what are your regrets?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.600]   What do you wish you had done more when you were younger?
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's almost always travel more, see more of the world.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.320]   And so I said, wow, we all have this real hunger to travel and take more trips.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240]   What is it that's stopping us?
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.920]   And so I figured, look, there are two main things, time and money.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.680]   I can't give you more time, but I think it's a little bit overrated the extent
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.040]   to which a lack of time is curtailing our vacation ability, because when you look
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.160]   into the data of how people use their vacation time, if assuming you do have a
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.600]   job that gives you paid time off, most people are not using their full allotment
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   of vacation time, over 50% of people leave vacation days unused every single year.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.000]   You know, collectively we leave about a billion days of vacation unused
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.840]   every single year as Americans.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.480]   We, it's not for lack of time.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   I think it's the headache and expense and uncertainty of booking flights
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.720]   that's stopping us from traveling more.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.320]   You know, the mental experiment that I like to propose is imagine you
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.760]   could snap your fingers tomorrow and all flights anywhere in the world
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   were just 200 bucks round trip.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.840]   Where would you go?
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   How many trips would you take?
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   I think for most people, they would go, you know, go to Brazil.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.240]   They'd go to Spain.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.160]   They'd go to Japan.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.880]   They'd go to Australia.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.440]   They'd go to Botswana, like all these amazing places around the world.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.680]   And I think we would take far more trips than we actually do right now.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   I think people will be taking three or four or five vacations.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.760]   Whereas right now they might be taking just one every single year.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.680]   And so it dawned on me, if you can master cheap flights, and if you can all of a
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.600]   sudden get over that hurdle, learn how to not overpay for flights, but learn how
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.320]   to really take advantage of the cheap flights that are all around us, then
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.200]   you're able to take more vacations.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.720]   You're able to take better vacations, happier vacation, and you wind up enjoying
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.760]   yourself more, not only on the trip, but when you get back as well.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.000]   And so this book was this culmination of me realizing, folks, like I wanted to
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.120]   kind of convey not only how to find cheap flights, but the myriad ways in which
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.040]   they are truly life-changing and how they can really change the way you travel and
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.400]   the way that you go through life and be able to avoid that situation where you,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.240]   you know, grow up, get old in life and look back and wish you had traveled
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.200]   more when you were younger.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.520]   That's what I'm trying to give folks the ticket permission to do now.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.000]   I mean, I've traveled.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.080]   I'm trying to take a trip every year overseas, at least once a year and small
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.840]   trips around, around the country or North America, shorter.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.080]   I know that one of the coolest things, my sister went to college and I had learned
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.560]   a while ago that only, only like 50% of Americans have a passport.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.120]   And I just recently saw last month, another survey said only 37% of
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.520]   Americans have a valid passport.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.640]   And I thought, well, that's a huge barrier.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.360]   And the coolest thing about the school she went to, uh, was they had a fund.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.000]   Someone made a lot of money and donated a fund to the school
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.560]   to give everyone a passport.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.480]   So when you went to college, if you didn't have a passport, some wealthy
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.640]   man or woman or family or endowment decided we're going to donate enough
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   money so that every kid has the ability to travel internationally when they
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   graduate.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.560]   And so I'm a huge fan of that.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   I thought that was so cool.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.800]   I love that because not only is it such an incredible world out there.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.200]   I mean, yeah, certainly within, within our own country, but outside it too.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   I mean, there's so many amazing life-changing places, but travel, you
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.960]   know, one of the chapters that devote to this is this fact that travel is medicine.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.000]   It leads to happier trips.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.520]   More of them, folks who travel see huge boost to their own personal wellbeing.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.200]   They're healthier.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.880]   They're happier.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.560]   They're more professionally successful.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.600]   They're more likely to get promoted at work.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.200]   All of these things that really kind of give us a boost in our wellbeing just by
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.000]   being the type of person who is taking those trips, who's going to, you know, to
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.360]   Europe and South America and Latin America and far be it from the situation that
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.440]   existed decades ago, where travel is something that only existed for the rich
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.160]   and the wealthy, we are living right now in the golden age of cheap flights.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   It has never been cheaper to travel overseas as it is right now.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   And so I want to like make sure that folks know the good news.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.440]   You know, this is why I'm out here preaching the gospel of cheap flights,
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.160]   because if you realize I don't have to pay a thousand dollars to fly to Europe, I
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.040]   don't have to pay a thousand dollars to fly to Asia.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.200]   I can get those flights sometimes for as little as, you know, just a couple of
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.400]   weeks ago, we saw flights from the U S to Japan for March of next year, from March
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.240]   of 2022 for 202 bucks round trip from all over the U S.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.680]   And so if you can put yourself in a position to get those flights, I used to pay
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.080]   more to fly home to visit my folks in Dayton, Ohio, than I would have paid to fly
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   to Japan for this trip.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.320]   And Japan is amazing.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.400]   If you have not been to Japan, anyone, like it is one of the most amazing travel
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   experiences you can have.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.480]   I often get asked, you know, where's your favorite place to travel, Scott?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.960]   And I hate picking because, you know, it's like picking between your children.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   But if I'm forced to, it's always Japan and Mexico.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.600]   Like those two places in my mind, if I can only go to two other countries outside
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.200]   the U S it'll be those two.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.560]   I have a Japan's always at the top of my list.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.520]   If you have a time machine or, you know, to go forward or backwards, Syria was, was
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.720]   a top country for me.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.000]   I'm not saying Syria is a great place to go right now, but 10 years ago we went and
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.800]   it was incredible.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.840]   And I, I'm optimistic that sometime in the future it will be another great travel.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   So that must've been like just before the war.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.560]   Yeah, it was unintentionally.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.280]   It was in 2010.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   Wow.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.080]   Like really the year before.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.960]   That's amazing.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.480]   But a wonderful country.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.640]   Amazing people.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.880]   So hospitable.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.600]   So, okay.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.680]   So $200, is that a target?
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.280]   If you told someone, if you really want to get serious and you want to travel
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.520]   overseas, should they be waiting for $200 fares?
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.880]   Is there a sweet spot where you think like, this is kind of what you should
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.120]   expect if you're, if you're kind of flexible?
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.920]   So the way that, the way that I would think about it is that you have three
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:55.040]   main areas of flexibility and the more you don't have to be fully flexible
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.200]   to be able to get cheap flights.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.880]   Cheap flights are not something reserved for, you know, 22 year olds
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.560]   who have no obligations whatsoever.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.520]   Cheap flights are there for all of us, but the more flexibility you can give
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.240]   yourself, the better your odds of getting a good deal.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.200]   So there are three main areas of flexibility.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.920]   There's where you travel, there's when you travel, and there's
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.400]   when you book your flights.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.320]   And so even if you say, okay, I really want to go to Japan.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.520]   If you can give yourself a lot more flexibility on those other two areas,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.400]   say I want to go to Japan, but it doesn't matter when I go, I'll go whenever the
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.280]   cheap flights pop up and I'll book when they, you know, when those flights do
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.520]   pop up, rather than saying, I have to book my flight this week, or I have
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.080]   to book my flight next week, that's how you put yourself in a good position.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.880]   Because when those $202 Japan flights popped up a few weeks ago, there was
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   no way of knowing in advance that those deals were going to pop up.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.200]   We had nothing, you know, there was nothing in the literature.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.960]   There's nothing in the historical data.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.120]   There's no way to say definitively, this is where that next cheap
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.160]   flight is going to pop up.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.840]   I can guarantee you they will pop up.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.160]   You know, I've been doing this job for six years and every single
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.120]   day we see cheap flights pop up.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.480]   But where that next one will be and when, when it'll be available for it,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.280]   it's, it's impossible to say in advance.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.080]   So the more flexibility you can give yourself in certain areas, the better
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.760]   your odds of still getting a good deal.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.720]   Even if you don't have to say, I'll go anywhere, anytime you can say,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.680]   I want to go to Japan, I'll keep my dates open.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.600]   I want to travel somewhere over the summer because maybe I've got kids in
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.560]   school or I've got, you know, I'm a teacher, this is the only time I can
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.440]   travel, but I'll keep my destination open because that way I'm still giving
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.440]   myself the best odds of getting a cheap flight, thinking of flexibility less as
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.120]   a binary, less as an on-off switch and more of as a dimmer switch is going to
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.840]   be how you put yourself in a good position to get those great deals.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.360]   And if someone said, okay, I want to go to Japan, you know, is this the kind of
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.080]   thing where a cheap flight to Japan, maybe not all the way to 200, but let's
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   say like, you know, not a thousand dollars, you know, maybe four or five,
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.040]   $600, do you think they have to wait on average a week, a month, a year, two
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.560]   years?
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.960]   How, how often do kind of the average destinations show up on the, the really
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.440]   good deals?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.760]   Yeah, great question.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.440]   It depends.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.680]   Uh, it depends a lot on where you're flying and where you're flying out of.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.760]   So if you are in a big city, you know, New York, LA, Chicago, San Francisco,
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.400]   they definitely get the highest quantity of deals.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.040]   One of the things I actually argue in the book is that small airports like
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.680]   Dayton, like my home airport growing up of Dayton, Ohio actually get the best
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.600]   deals because the normal price of flying, let's say somewhere like Dayton to
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   Tokyo, normally that, you know, $2,000 or something more, but in that deal, in
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.600]   that Japan deal a few weeks ago, there were flights available from Dayton,
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.000]   Ohio to Tokyo, Japan for 233 bucks round trip.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.080]   And, you know, that's a far better deal than even the $202 round trip flight
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.040]   from New York to Tokyo, because New York to Tokyo is a fair that you would
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   normally expect to pay a lot less for maybe a normal time, you know, 800 bucks,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.560]   900 bucks.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.480]   And so that $700 drop, it's excellent.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.120]   Don't get me wrong, but it's nowhere near the, you know, $1,700 drop, like
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.600]   you saw with the Dayton flights, but so flights to Japan, they've actually been
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.880]   popping up a little bit more often lately than they have historically, obviously
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.440]   you can't go to Japan today and we don't know exactly when it'll reopen for
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.680]   tourism, but the good news is that most of those flights have availability all
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.280]   the way through March, 2022.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.360]   And so if you book it now for 10 months from now, I think, A, there's a very
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   high likelihood that things will be open by then and B, even if they're not, the
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.400]   airlines are giving flexibility now so that when you make a new booking, you
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.680]   can change your dates without any penalty to do so.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.040]   You can, you know, it used to cost five, six, $700 to change your dates.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   And now you can just do so without any penalty.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.480]   If the new dates you switch to are more expensive, you have to pay the fair
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.320]   difference, but if the new dates are cheaper, you actually get the difference
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.360]   back in the form of a travel credit.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.800]   So all the more reason to be prioritizing cheap flights, but when, you know, how
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.560]   frequently cheap flights pop up depends a bit on the destination.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   We see it, you know, almost every day to, to, to Europe and especially Western and
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.160]   Southern Europe, almost every, you know, ever, certainly every week to like the
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.080]   Caribbean and Latin America where you see it a little bit less common is parts of
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.480]   like Southern South America, most of, of Africa, Oceania, you know, Asia, like
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.040]   sort of Australia, New Zealand, it's not that deals never pop up there.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.120]   They certainly still do maybe once every, once every month or two, but because
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.880]   there's just less flights between the U S and those places that there's less
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.080]   competition that tends to drive the availability of cheap flights in the way
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.560]   we see to like Europe and domestic travel and Hawaii and Japan and places like that.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   But it sounds like if I had a goal to go to New Zealand sometime and I could book
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   it any time in the next 12 months and I'm paying attention, I could probably
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.080]   find a deal once a year.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.560]   Oh, a hundred percent.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.320]   I mean, if you put yourself in a position by giving yourself that much lead time,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.280]   you say, I'm going to monitor over these next 12 months and get a good, you know,
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.760]   and, and, and be patient when the flights are expensive, but pull the trigger when
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.800]   flights are cheap, there's basically nowhere in the world that you can't be
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.840]   able that you wouldn't be able to visit and get a cheap flight doing so now, you
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.440]   know, not all cheap flights are going to be equal.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.960]   You're a, you know, we regularly see flights from, let's say basically all
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:51.000]   over the U S to Barcelona for like 300 bucks round trip, you're not going to
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.480]   very often see a $300 flight from the U S to New Zealand or the U S to the
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.840]   Maldives, but you know, when the normal price from the U S to New Zealand is
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.680]   $1,500, you can count on finding that deal.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.520]   Some point over the next 12 months for, you know, 700 bucks, 600 bucks.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.720]   Sometimes maybe even 500.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.480]   If we'll get really lucky by giving yourself that much leeway, you're
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.080]   putting yourself in a really good position.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.760]   The analogy I like to draw is there's this saying among pilots
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.640]   that altitude is your friend.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.040]   You know, if, if, if there's a problem with the plane, if there's
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.280]   something wrong with the engine, you'd rather be at 30,000 feet than at 3,000
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.080]   feet, because you have a lot more time to fix it and just a lot more options.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.760]   If you're hoping to get a cheap flight, altitude is your friend.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.160]   You're going to have a lot better opportunity to find that cheap flight.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.400]   If you start looking 12 months in advance, then if you start
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.120]   looking a month in advance.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.240]   Okay.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.800]   So if in, in the true flexible sense, that makes sense.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.480]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.440]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.560]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.520]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:13.160]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1, 37,000.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.680]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.080]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.600]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining

[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.320]   25 NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.960]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.880]   in days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.480]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.760]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.400]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.000]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.800]   bonuses on every purchase.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.200]   You can also load it on your partner's phone.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.800]   So they always know the best cards to use.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.440]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.760]   from over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.000]   Chase, Bank of America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.920]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.400]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.240]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.680]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.760]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.640]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.040]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.120]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.880]   Is there anything to do other than just sign up for Scott's
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.040]   Cheap Flights and wait?
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.560]   Are there other places you should be looking, other things you should
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   do to get these cheap flights?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.600]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.360]   But look, Scott's Cheap Flights is there to try to make sure that you
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.000]   never miss when great deals pop up out of your home airport.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.200]   But it's still, you know, a lot of folks really love searching for flights,
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.520]   really love poking around, seeing what's out there and the amount, like the
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.360]   number of tools out there to help with that these days is like, "Man, I wish
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.560]   these tools existed like 10 years ago when I first started traveling."
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.600]   I was using ITA Matrix back in the day.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.160]   Yeah, yeah, having to memorize just like bizarre code lines.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.240]   Oh gosh, it pains me now to think about it in retrospect.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.520]   But yeah.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.320]   So what are the tools?
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.720]   What's the toolkit for a person who wants to be a cheap flight
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.920]   hacker and find all the deals?
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.640]   Absolutely.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.520]   So the first and foremost, Google Flights.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.560]   Google Flights is one that, like the hidden secret to know here when you're
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.320]   searching for flights is that the price is going to be basically the
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.800]   same no matter where you search.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.720]   There's nowhere that like always has the cheapest flights.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.920]   It's just not, despite all the, you know, millions of dollars in marketing
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.120]   and this and that, whether you search for your flights on Priceline or Expedia
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.840]   or direct with the airline or Google Flights, it's all going to generally
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.160]   be about the same.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.760]   And so the way that I tend to decide where I want to do my flight searching
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.360]   is which one has the best user experience.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.600]   Like which one has, well, lets me search the quickest, most powerfully.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.800]   I can look at all my options.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.880]   And to my mind, it's Google Flights.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.080]   So, and the reason why I like Google Flights, lightning fast.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.240]   You can search not just one airport to one destination.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.080]   You can search seven origin airports to seven destination airports, and it'll
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.160]   show you the single best fare among any of those routes.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.800]   And so let me show, let me give you an example of how that's useful.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.600]   Let's say you live in Philadelphia.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.880]   You want to travel to Europe this summer.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.280]   You don't care exactly where you go.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.000]   And you know, you know, as soon as you get to Europe, you can hop on a train.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.800]   You can hop on a Ryanair flight wherever and get your final
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.920]   destination really cheap.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.120]   You just want to get a good deal flying across the ocean.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.880]   If you go to kayak, you'll have to search, you know, Philadelphia to Berlin,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.000]   Philadelphia to Dublin, Philadelphia to Paris, Philadelphia to Rome.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.360]   And each time, you know, it's going to take 20, 30 seconds.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.000]   Like with Google Flights, you get to search, not only put in Philadelphia,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.880]   but you get to search all three New York airports and all three DC airports.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.040]   And you can say, you can put in seven different or seven different
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.400]   destination airports in Europe.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.520]   Say, okay, I'll check for flights to Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, London,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.680]   you know, I don't know, Barcelona, Madrid, and Zurich.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.080]   And of all 49 of those possible routes, what Google Flights will do is it'll
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.960]   show you the single cheapest one across any dates over the next 12 months.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.760]   And so this way it makes it really simple to be able to quickly isolate what, what
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.200]   is the cheap flight that's available rather than having to do 49 separate
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.600]   searches the way you'd have to do on some other flight search engines.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.160]   So that amount of flexibility and really being able to see quickly what are the
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.880]   cheapest options is how a cheap flight lover like myself, and like I hope I'm
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   trying to convert many folks into, that's the way you're going to get a really good deal.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.240]   And I also, I use Google Flights almost exclusively.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.360]   I like to, you know, you can say up to two stop, up to one stop, you know,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.320]   depending on where you're coming from, you can say total travel time.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.920]   I think when you start getting into long international itineraries,
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.280]   sometimes you might see these crazy 14 hour layover plus two changes.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.800]   So not only can you use that calendar to look at dates, but if you set those
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.280]   rules, they refresh the entire calendar.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.320]   So that when you're looking, what is it like in June?
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.360]   What is it like in July?
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.680]   They're filtering all that for only flights that are less than, you know, 30
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.040]   hours, which if you were flying from New York to LA would be crazy.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.440]   But if you were flying to Japan from Florida, it might make more sense.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.320]   Exactly.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.520]   And that's such a key thing that, you know, a lot of folks, when they first
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.680]   hear me ramble on about cheap flights, what they might be thinking in their
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.720]   head or what they might be saying to me is, Oh, these cheap flights, they
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.080]   must be terrible flights, right?
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.320]   Like it's all on spirit.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.680]   It's always like five stops and 40 hours of travel.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.600]   No, no, no.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.960]   Cheap flights do not have to be inconvenient flights.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   You know, today's expensive flight might be tomorrow's cheap flight.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.080]   Those $202 round trip flights to Japan on a five star airline with one stop on route.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.800]   You know, that $130 flight that I got to Milan was a nonstop flight on
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.920]   United with two check bags included.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   Like cheap flights can absolutely be, be, be great flights.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.800]   And, and if you kind of tell yourself, Oh, if it's going to be cheap,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.080]   then it's going to be terrible.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   That's actually, that's a recipe for ending up getting really expensive
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.760]   flights, because if you, you know, if you, if you resign yourself to only
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.000]   thinking expensive flights are out there, then you're not going to
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.360]   hold out for them being cheap.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.160]   You know, it's not the way hotels are, where the price tends to reflect the
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.680]   quality, the price in a lot of ways on a flight is a completely independent
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.920]   variable to how good the flight is.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.840]   And so there was a game, there was a game you mentioned in the, in the book,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.440]   which was when you sit down next to someone, you know, ask him, Hey, how
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.800]   much did you pay for this seat?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.640]   And you could be sitting in virtually the exact same seats.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.040]   Let's assume no one's in the middle.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.320]   So you're in aisle and window aisle and window.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.360]   Someone could pay five times as much as you did for your flight.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.600]   If you have a hundred people on a flight, chances are they paid a
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   hundred different prices to be there, or at least like 98 different prices.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.720]   We think of, you know, a lot of folks get, I think, stuck in this category
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.160]   error of thinking of airfare as something that is static and stable or
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.640]   thinking about that there, you know, I'll get asked, what does it cost to fly to
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.120]   London?
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.560]   What does it cost to fly to Tokyo or Miami or Hawaii?
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.880]   There is no one price, you know, I like the, the, my favorite fare that I can
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.600]   remember to illustrate this was a flight we were looking at from Atlanta to
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   Amsterdam that on Monday was $800 round trip on Tuesday was $300 round trip.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.800]   And on Wednesday was $1,300 round trip.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.360]   And it was the exact same flight.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.760]   And so, you know, rainbows and gold coins to you, if you booked on Tuesday
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.840]   and got that $300 flight and, you know, just like thunderstorms and, and, and
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.720]   woe to you if you booked on Wednesday and paid, paid four times the price.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.160]   And you mentioned these don't have to be on budget airlines.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.960]   How do you feel about budget airlines?
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   I have, uh, my only, my only story for budget airlines, which is a spirit story
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   was we went to Cartagena Columbia for my bachelor party and spirit decided while
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.320]   we were at the airport that they weren't going to fly to Columbia anymore, not
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   just that day, but we called customer service as soon as soon as we saw this
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.040]   line not moving and they were like, sorry, we don't fly to Columbia anymore.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.360]   And I was like, what do you mean you don't fly to Columbia?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.840]   Like you're just not going.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.680]   So we all, every single person had to buy a new flight or wait three or four
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.800]   days until spirit would book you on their systems were not fast that that's
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.760]   like maybe the worst case scenario.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.960]   But is there a place in, in cheap travel for these budget airlines?
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.840]   So your story exactly illustrates the way that I think about budget flight, budget
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:00.000]   carriers, I love budget carriers, but I basically never fly them.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.720]   And the reason why I love them is because.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.520]   It is thanks to the spirit airlines of the world and the Norwegian airlines of
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.000]   the world and the air Asia's that we are living in the golden age of cheap flights.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.800]   And the reason why is that competition between airlines, the number one
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.000]   determinant of cheap flights.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.800]   And so when spirit comes in and sees, oh, you know, American, you're charging, uh,
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.120]   $500 to fly down to Columbia.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.920]   What if, what happens if we come in and offer those flights for 200 bucks, most
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.640]   people are going to book those, that spirit flight, because when you look at
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.320]   survey data, by far the number one variable, the number one determinant that
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.840]   people are using to decide what flight to book is just price is it's the, you
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.680]   know, it's a commodity.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.880]   They're not saying, oh, I really like American.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.640]   So I'm going to pay $300 extra.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.120]   We're just like, this is just a means of getting from point A to point B.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.600]   So I want to go with what's cheapest.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.400]   And so this is why I love budget airlines because by setting that $200 price,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.160]   they're forcing the other airlines, your Americans and your Deltas and your air
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   France's to drop their prices to compete.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.040]   You know, when, when, when Delta first rolled out.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.360]   Basic economy fares about a decade ago, the original name for them on investor
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   calls was spirit match fares, because this was how their way of trying to compete
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.400]   with them, but why so, okay, Scott, you love them so much.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.760]   Why do you never fly them?
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.680]   Well, for exactly the reason that that sort of nightmare scenario that you ran
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.920]   into, if something goes wrong, if a flight gets majorly delayed or canceled on a
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.880]   budget airline that has the, the potential of really upending your entire trip.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.920]   And what I mean by that is if you had been booked on, let's say American
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.040]   airlines down to Cartagena, well, you know, even if American, even if that
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   flight that you had been on got canceled, what they fly down to Cartagena, you
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   know, four or five, six, seven times a day, they'll put you on a different flight.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.480]   Let's say, you know, or they'll put you on a partner airline in the region.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.800]   You get to fly on, you know, now you can fly on like jet blue down or anybody
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.360]   else that they're, they're, they're partnered with, whereas the budget
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.200]   airlines, they tend to a have very sparse schedules.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.520]   So maybe they're only flying a couple times a week to Cartagena B they
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.400]   tend to not have partner airlines.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.520]   And so when that flight gets canceled, even if they had still
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.040]   continued, been flying to Columbia, it might've been three days
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.720]   until their next flight there.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.280]   And so all of a sudden you're, what, what am I supposed to do?
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.720]   Just cut three days off of my trip off my vacation.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.120]   Stay at the hotel airport that they're putting you up in for $25 a night.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.680]   Horrible.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.240]   And then, and then, and then even if, you know, then you're in that worst
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.000]   case scenario of, you know, you get the refund from spirit.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.400]   I got to imagine those last minute, you know, when you're booking those last
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.480]   minute same day fares on another airline, those must've been incredibly expensive.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.200]   Like those must've been a, a horrendous price.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.520]   And so the potential for those really bad situations, like when something goes bad
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.440]   on a budget airline on your, your itinerary, it can go really bad.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.840]   Whereas the downside risk with the full service airlines tends
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.280]   to be quite a bit better.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.160]   You know, something goes bad, your flight gets canceled.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.320]   Usually it's only going to result in a few hours delay to your getting to your
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.600]   final destination than you would have otherwise.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.320]   And when, you know, so totally agree.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.920]   I think if you're thinking about, Oh, I want to take a quick, quick trip
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.680]   somewhere, and if it, if there's a problem, it's not a big deal and I've
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.960]   got lots of flexibility, maybe it's fine.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.920]   Or if you live in a hub city for an airline, that's a budget airline, maybe
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.760]   it's fine, but I, I will not be flying budget airlines in the future in these
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.000]   kind of international scenarios that aren't country hubs, because
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.280]   that was just a disaster.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.480]   And, you know, each trip is going to depend a little bit.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.600]   And to be clear, like, Hey, I think the actual onboard experience of most
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.160]   budget airlines is basically the same as, you know, if you're flying
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.480]   American, you're flying United.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.360]   I don't think it's going to be that drastically different.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   Uh, and B oftentimes actually budget airlines have more direct flights
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.280]   depending on where you're flying than many of the legacy airlines that
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.760]   do a more hub and spoke model.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.960]   So you always have to connect, you know, American through Charlotte
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.560]   or through Miami or whatever.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.800]   You might have more direct flights on the budget on, but, you know, seeing
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.200]   how often they're flying, if it's one of those things where it's international,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.320]   it's twice a week.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.960]   And so if my flight gets canceled, I am really screwed here.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.200]   Those are considerations that I'm taking into account when I'm trying
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.560]   to decide which flight to book.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.120]   And so, you know, look, if that Spirit Airlines flight is $800 cheaper than
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.640]   the American flight, yeah, I'm going to book Spirit, but if it's $50 cheaper,
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.360]   $25 cheaper, to me, it's generally worth the premium to pay, to, to be
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.920]   flying on a full service airline.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.720]   Yep.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.360]   And we talked a lot about flight gets delayed, flight gets canceled.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.600]   What are your tricks when that happens?
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   You're at the airport and you've just learned your flight is canceled.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.560]   What do you do that makes you better off than other people
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.280]   standing in line or waiting around?
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.560]   Oh man, I like, I jump into like hyper organized.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.960]   This is like Scott at his peak superhero mode.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.080]   That flight gets canceled.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.280]   Okay.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.160]   First thing I do is I go find, you know, where the customer service airline
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.560]   is, and I go stand in it because I want to make sure that I'm getting
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.720]   as good a spot as possible.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.120]   And in case in case my problem can only be solved by in-person agent, but
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.880]   generally speaking, folks, phone agents for the airline have just as much
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   power as the people in person at the airport.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.920]   And so while I'm, you know, walking to that line, while I'm finding that
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.120]   customer service place and getting, you know, reserving my space in line,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:45.000]   I'm calling up the airline and trying to get my ticket, you know, rerouted,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.880]   trying to get a new flight directly with somebody over the phone, because
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.520]   that actually might end up being a lot quicker, especially if the line is
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.400]   long or there's no weight over the phone.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.640]   If I'm calling the main service line and they're saying, you know, an hour
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   wait, two hours wait, three hours wait, what I'm doing, you know, not
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.120]   sitting there waiting for that.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.960]   What I'm doing is I'm looking up then what are the international
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.560]   phone numbers for this airline.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.640]   So Delta doesn't just have, you know, offices in Atlanta, free to call.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.720]   They've got offices in Canada and in Mexico and in the United Kingdom and
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.120]   Singapore and all over the world.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.000]   And so, you know, you want to check what your own cell phone rates and
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.680]   policies are about international calls.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.720]   But nobody really thinks to call Delta's Canada office, but the Canadian agents
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.400]   for Delta can help sort out your itinerary just the same as an American agent could.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.640]   Without the whole time.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.880]   And, and, and, you know, you, nobody else is calling them.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.520]   So you generally are able to get right through.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.760]   So those are the types of things that I'm doing quickly.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.200]   I'm also looking up and seeing what are my best alternative options.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.480]   You know, I'm pulling up Google flights.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.640]   I'm seeing on this airline or any partner airlines, what other ways can I
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.080]   get to my final destination right now, irrespective of the price, take whatever
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.880]   fare it shows and just totally ignore it.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.520]   Because, you know, when your flight gets canceled or delayed or something, the
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.680]   airline just wants, they still have to get you to a final destination.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.280]   They're not charging you anything to put you on a different flight.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.920]   So just find out what flights look most convenient for me, what's best for my
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.800]   schedule, because if you can come in prepared to that agent, Hey, yes, you
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.840]   know, my flight just got canceled.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.360]   Can you put me on that next flight that goes, you know, through JFK and then over
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.200]   to Rome, they are much able, like able to help you more quickly.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.800]   I mean, look, they've got hundreds of people.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.240]   They're trying to take care of your own.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.520]   You're always going to be your own best advocates.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   So the more information, the more preparation you can do before you get
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.120]   somebody on to help you, the better off you're going to be.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.680]   And then I, I think you probably said this in the book too, but it's
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.480]   something I've been doing.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.200]   If something goes wrong, I wouldn't demand it, but I would ask if there's
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.680]   anything you get for that, right?
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.360]   If the best flights tomorrow morning, do you have a hotel?
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.640]   Do you have a meal voucher?
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.720]   Can I get food?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.200]   If there's no seats in coach, can I have a seat in business class?
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.240]   If there are seats in coach, can I still get a business class upgrade?
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.480]   You know, they might, they they're less likely to do it when it's a, you
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.160]   know, I don't know, it's canceled for weather thunderstorm, something like
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.400]   that, then if it's a, but if it's a situation where let's say your flight
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.600]   is oversold and they need a volunteer, you know, not only can you expect to
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.560]   get a voucher for some, you know, some amount of compensation, you should
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.160]   hold out for as much as possible.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.840]   But you should absolutely be asking for those things.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.680]   Think of it like the secret menu at In-N-Out where they're not going to
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.560]   tell you, oh, you can negotiate for a business class seat on the
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.000]   replacement flight you're given.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.880]   You can negotiate for a hotel room for tonight or this or that.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.600]   But if, you know, especially if the airline's in a desperate situation,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.680]   you can a hundred percent ask for those things.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.360]   Worst case, they say no, but best case you're going to get it.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   And I've gotten upgraded to business class on flights that I've been bumped
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.760]   off of, because again, when the airline is in that situation, oftentimes they
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.800]   don't have a lot of leverage because especially, you know, I mean, you
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.160]   remember the David Dow incident on United.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:16.680]   I mean, United lost tons and tons of money because of just the PR hit from
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.560]   dragging this poor guy off the plane.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.640]   Whereas if they had just then, Hey, we'll give you a first class seat.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.520]   We'll give you a thousand dollar voucher for your next flight.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.160]   Like, like you, even if you didn't get him to agree to it, somebody on that
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.760]   plane is absolutely going to take it.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.320]   And so remembering, you know, the leverage that you might have,
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.600]   it's always worth asking.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.920]   And I actually go in and look whenever I'm taking a flight where I'm flexible.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.480]   I look how full it is.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.760]   I've remembered a couple of times where I'm, you know, let's say I'm in the
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.320]   bathroom and then I hear them announcing like the flight might be sold.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.160]   If you want to do something, come to the desk.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   I'm like, no, I want to go.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.080]   So if a flight is full, look at the seat map.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.360]   If you're flexible and you take a voucher, definitely go to that desk and say, Hey,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.560]   I'm flexible if you need anyone.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.760]   So you're first in line, because if you wait until they make the announcement,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.520]   you might be fifth in line or 10th in line.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.480]   It's a very, it's, it's very much a first come first serve environment where, where
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.120]   I'll oftentimes even, you know, if I think I might, that situation might exist.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.640]   If I've got some flexibility, I'm hoping to get a decent voucher.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.400]   I'll sometimes just pick the seat that's closest to the, to the gate agent's desk.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.680]   And it, because I know if I'm that first one in line, I'm going to get the
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.360]   voucher rather than somebody else.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.080]   All right.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.040]   So I want to just jump through a bunch.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.520]   There were a bunch of travel hacks, both that I have that you put in the
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.640]   book that are all around flights.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.880]   But first, when do you book the flight?
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.760]   Is there a point in time where you're waiting when there's no flexibility, right?
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.040]   I have a family reunion and we're supposed to go and it's over the 4th of July.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.520]   It's, you know, right now, fares are expensive.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   I've looked all the airports I can drive to all the airports nearby.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.200]   There's just nothing cheap.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.920]   You know, what do you do when there's not, you know, do I wait to the last minute?
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.600]   Do I just buy whatever it is three weeks out?
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.880]   How do you decide what to do when there's not flexibility?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.440]   So first let me bust two myths around when is cheapest to book.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.200]   There's still the sense that a lot of people have that flights are
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.680]   cheapest to book on Tuesday at 1 PM.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.320]   I don't know if you've ever heard that one, or sometimes they'll say
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.280]   like Saturday at midnight or some, you know, arbitrary time.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.240]   This was true 20 years ago when airlines first started selling their tickets
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.320]   online, because they would actually just load their fares on once a week.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.600]   And so if you were one of the first ones to book right after those fares got
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.040]   loaded, you might be able to get one of the, you know, only handful of
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.920]   cheap seats that they had available.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.280]   The problem is that that hasn't been the way that airlines have been
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.080]   pricing their tickets for years.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.240]   Nowadays, tickets are set in airfare set algorithmically, you know, it's set
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:57.960]   by these fancy big computers that are much more dynamic and airfare is
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.280]   changing every single day, oftentimes by the hour, if not by the minute.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.520]   And so rather than it being a preset time, like it used to be, there's no
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.560]   single cheapest time or no predictable cheapest time when flights are going
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:17.600]   to be cheapest to book, no like set time of the week, similar with last minute
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.880]   flights, you know, 40 years ago, you often could get a good deal if you
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.440]   waited to last minute because the air, you know, the thinking was, oh, the
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:31.040]   airline, if any seat that is unfilled on that plane, as soon as the door closes,
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.600]   it's just lost potential revenue.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:37.120]   So they're going to want to slash the price leading up to departure to try
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.800]   to fill as many seats as possible.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.600]   What the, that used to be, all the airlines did it again, 40 something years
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.120]   ago, but now what the airlines have realized is that the people booking
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.360]   those last minute flights, weren't leisure travelers, it was actually
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.400]   tending to be business travelers and business travelers, not only did they
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.120]   make their plans late, but they didn't care what the price costs because it
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.440]   was their company paying, not them.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.800]   And so rather than slashing the price, the way the airlines could make the
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.560]   most money was by jacking up the price and gouging them for those last minute
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.680]   flights that business travelers love to buy.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:13.000]   So instead, you've got a trip rather than waiting for two, you know, the last
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.520]   minute, or just saying, I'm going to book it on Tuesday at 1:00 PM, both
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.600]   with which are going to do nothing to help you get a cheap flight.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   The best way to think about timing of booking your flights is to think in
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.880]   terms of what I call the Goldilocks windows.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   So not too early, not too late, just right in the middle.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.320]   And if you're traveling, so the Goldilocks windows vary, if you're
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.280]   traveling domestically or internationally, if you're traveling domestically, typically
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.080]   about one to three months before travel is when cheap flights are most likely to
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.800]   pop up for international travel.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.680]   It's more like two to eight months in advance is when those cheap flights
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.160]   are most likely to pop up if you're traveling during a peak travel period.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.000]   So like middle of summer, Christmas, New Year's, or I don't know, going
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.200]   to Dublin for St.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.040]   Patrick's day, you typically want to add a couple months to those recommendations
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.480]   because again, they're just such popular times that the cheap seats
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.600]   are liable to sell out even sooner.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.560]   But thinking about those Goldilocks windows as when cheap flights
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.800]   are most likely to pop up, that's how you put yourself in a good position
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.840]   to make sure that you are getting it when those cheap flights do pop up.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.320]   Yep, and I'll put the Goldilocks rules and everything we talk
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.800]   about in the show notes at allthehacks.com.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.840]   They're also in the book.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.000]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.200]   enjoy is actually so good for you.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.960]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.600]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.840]   ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.320]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:54.360]   leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.280]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.520]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.840]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.600]   in pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.000]   seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.760]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.800]   the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.840]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.120]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.720]   backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.440]   sugar, and more, and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.000]   polyphenols than all other teas in the world, but you don't even have
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.440]   to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free U.S.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.280]   shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.720]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free

[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.160]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.

[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.720]   P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.440]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.800]   a great addition to your new year routine.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.360]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.000]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   sources the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.440]   their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.240]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.200]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade, sign up for a
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.240]   subscription, or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.680]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.160]   it, and over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.840]   this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.840]   the Moon, and it's so delicious.

[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.000]   One of the other tricks, so one of the challenges with flight prices when you
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.240]   travel internationally, you know this, is that you can only go from the U, like
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.840]   only Ryanair, great low-cost airline, all three, they don't fly to the U.S.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.560]   You're never going to book a ticket from the U.S.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.360]   that includes a Ryanair flight.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.880]   I don't want to say never, but you're saying you can't right now.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.120]   Yeah, so today you cannot.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   And so my process was, let's find a fare to cross an ocean, and then let's find a
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.040]   fare to get where I want to go.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.640]   You kind of have a term for it.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.320]   This is the Greek island trip.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.360]   How does someone execute this well?
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.480]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.600]   So let's say you want to travel to Santorini this summer.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.560]   Look, Greece open for Americans right now, just beautiful, iconic destination.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.880]   If you go search for flights, let's say from New York to Santorini for the
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.280]   summer, chances are they're going to be quite expensive.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.520]   I mean, regularly, you know, $1,500, sometimes more.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.880]   But instead of giving up that dream of visiting Santorini, the Greek islands,
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:46.160]   what you should do instead is check for flights from New York to Athens, because
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.680]   flights from New York to Athens regularly pop up for $400 round trip, $500 round trip.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.160]   If you can get that $400 flight from New York to Athens, you can then all of a
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.640]   sudden buy a separate flight from Athens to Santorini for like 50 bucks, or
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   you can take a ferry for 50 bucks.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:10.520]   It is by combining that trip with two separate itineraries, you're able to, you
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:15.640]   know, get the same trip for a quarter of the price that you would have otherwise
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.160]   had to pay, and the reason why is, to your point, when you search from New York to
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.640]   Santorini, the way that the airlines and the way that the flight search engines
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.360]   want to sell you a ticket is they only sell you a ticket on an airline or its
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.960]   partners, and no airline is currently a partner with Ryanair, so you can't find
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.800]   that cheapest flight from Athens to Santorini.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.240]   It'll just have to be on a separate, you know, partner airline.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.840]   Sometimes the cheapest flight across the ocean on that airline might have the most
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.040]   expensive flight from, let's say, you know, Athens to Santorini, and so it ends
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.680]   up being real expensive.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:56.440]   By crossing the ocean as cheaply as possible and then adding on a separate
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.920]   transportation to your final destination, that's how you execute the Greek island
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.840]   trip, and that's how you are able to get, you know, to these really kind of remote
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.560]   iconic places for 70, 80% less than you would have had to pay otherwise.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.840]   And plus, you know, best of all, because it's two separate itineraries, once you
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.880]   get to Athens, you could spend a couple days in Athens, if you want, before
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.840]   continuing on to the Greek islands.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.000]   You can take that time, be able to make it a two-for-one vacation in a way that
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.120]   you wouldn't necessarily have been able to if you had just booked one itinerary.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.080]   - Yeah, but do leave enough time.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.680]   It is very likely that you will not be able to check your bags all the way through.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.040]   - Yes.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.320]   - So I would say, if you're not going to take a day or two off, definitely leave
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.080]   enough time to go grab your bags, which you might have to do anyways for customs
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.760]   reasons, but just know that when you book your flight separately, you know, maybe
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   you're lucky if they happen to be partners, that they'll connect your bags,
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.960]   but often the answer is no.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.240]   - That is very key.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.200]   I'm glad you brought that up because not only do you need to, you know, consider
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.040]   bags, transit time, all that, but there's also the question of, look, on a normal
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.960]   flight, when you have one itinerary, if a delay on your first flight causes you to
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.240]   miss your connection, well, the airline is still responsible for getting you to your
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.040]   final destination.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.960]   They'll put you on the next flight, they'll put you on a partner airline, but if you
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.360]   have this flight from New York to Athens and then a separate ticket from Athens to
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.840]   Santorini, the first flight, the first airline has no responsibility for that
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.880]   second flight on a separate airline or your ferry tickets or whatever, and so you
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.360]   want to give yourself enough buffer time, sometimes even as long as a day or two, to
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.400]   make sure that even if there's a delay on your first flight, it won't result in you
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.520]   missing your second flight.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:44.480]   - Yeah, and two sites I'll mention that you mentioned in the book for finding out
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:49.000]   what airports fly everywhere, I think it was flightconnections.com, which I had not
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   heard of, I was actually using Wikipedia as the place I would go, I'd look at an
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.280]   airport and see all the destinations, I went to Flight Connections and I was like,
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.080]   wow, this would have saved me so much time, so that's a great place to say, if I can
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.400]   get myself to Paris, where can I go from Paris?
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.200]   - Yeah, exactly, so let me give you a personal example.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.840]   In a few weeks, I've got flights to travel over to Madrid, and until this morning,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.240]   until we got the good news that Spain will indeed be open by the time we're
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.000]   there, we had been wondering, are we going to have to fly somewhere else?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.520]   Are we going to not be allowed in Spain?
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.880]   And so I'd go on flightconnections.com and I would see, where can I get a non-stop
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:28.200]   flight out of Madrid to elsewhere that will be open for Americans?
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.960]   So seeing, can I fly to Albania?
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.080]   Can I fly to Greece?
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.760]   Can I fly to Croatia on a non-stop flight?
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.920]   Because I've kind of figured, look, I've only got a week, we're going to get there,
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.320]   we'll be tired, I don't want to have to take two or three flights to get to a final
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.160]   destination.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.520]   - Yeah, and you also mentioned Rome to Rio, which I think helps.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.800]   Maybe it's not a flight.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.200]   Maybe it's a train, maybe it's a bus, maybe it's a, you know, a ferry.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.520]   Yeah, a lot of options.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:57.480]   I used to use this site called Seat61, which was, like, all about trains.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.680]   And it was, I don't know if it's even still maintained, but it was really cool
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.680]   for very remote places.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.600]   We took a 52-hour train ride from Zambia to Tanzania.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.720]   - Ooh, how was that?
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.760]   - It was fun.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.200]   Like, the train broke down for three hours.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.320]   We, like, got out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.000]   We went to a village and we just hung out.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.840]   And then they, like, you know, pulled the horn on the train.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   And we were like, "I don't know if that's a one-minute warning or a 10-minute
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.200]   warning."
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.280]   So we just sprinted back to the train.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.160]   - See, I love that.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.960]   Not only do I love that story, but I think that's really emblematic of, I think it's
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.000]   in Chapter 11, you know, we explored this idea of travel and regrets.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.440]   And oftentimes, we have this sort of, like, anticipatory regret.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.400]   "Oh, I don't want to go to, you know, Zambia or Tanzania because I don't
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.920]   necessarily know the language or the customs, or will I like the food,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.480]   or what happens if the train that I'm taking breaks down?"
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.600]   When in reality, you know, not only are you going to have a great time,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.840]   but if something goes awry, if something funny, you know, happens,
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.320]   even if it's kind of, like, annoying or stressful or not terribly fun in the
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.000]   moment, it's a great story afterwards.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.680]   And you have some awesome memories that wouldn't have necessarily been quite as
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.600]   salient or quite as fun to relay if it had just been, you know, a normal trip
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:15.800]   where everything went exactly to plan and, you know, you didn't grow at all or get
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.080]   any interesting stories because you didn't risk anything.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:23.840]   - Yeah, I always say, leave some time on your trip to just explore and do things
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.960]   because you might not know that you want to do them until you get there.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.040]   And sure, there are some trips, like, if you want to go on a safari,
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.840]   it might be worth coordinating that before you go.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.920]   But if you're just landing in Rome, don't plan every day.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.800]   Leave a lot to chance.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.200]   We rented a Vespa and rode around.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.760]   Didn't think to do that before we got there, but it was so much fun.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.880]   - Yeah, and especially now with smartphones, like, being able to just...
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.800]   you're not there having to completely be, you know, stranded on your own in a
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.280]   country where you don't know anybody and don't know the language.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.880]   Your ability to be able to find stuff, to be able to find restaurants,
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.720]   to see what's interesting near you, to get directions.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.200]   It is much, much, much more possible and accessible now.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:12.720]   So, you're able to kind of have that ability, have that lifeline while also not,
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.680]   like you said, not overscheduling yourself.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.000]   Leave yourself open to serendipity and let yourself be able to kind of enjoy the
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.840]   spontaneity that travel can bring.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.440]   - Yeah.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.240]   So, I want to get back to a few of these hacks.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.440]   I'll ask you a few, I'll share a few.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.520]   Travel insurance.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.720]   Buy it, don't buy it.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.680]   I personally almost never buy it, and the reason why I never buy it is that I'm
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.160]   already insured in ways that people hadn't necessarily realized.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.360]   So, when you buy a flight, if the airline cancels or significantly changes your
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.640]   flight, under U.S. law, you're eligible for a cash refund, period.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.800]   If the airline, you know, has a big delay or they mess up your bags or lose them,
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.640]   they're going to give you some amount of compensation.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.680]   And plus your credit card, whatever credit card you paid for the flight with,
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.640]   many credit cards automatically carry travel protections on them as long as,
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.040]   again, you use that credit card to buy the flight.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.200]   And so, I always like to be very cognizant of the ways that I'm already
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.960]   automatically protected, and I don't necessarily want to buy something,
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.160]   pay extra to get protection that I already have.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.120]   Now, I think there are, you know, some, like a few types of trips,
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.760]   something like, you know, a big safari where maybe you had to prepay for the
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.080]   safari, and if the flight, you know, got delayed and you missed it,
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.680]   you're not going to be able to get your money back from the safari itself.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.560]   Yeah, there are some instances like that when I think insurance can make a lot
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.520]   of sense, but for me personally, I've kind of come to peace with generally not
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.240]   buying it because I'm already protected in a lot of ways.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.600]   - Yeah, and one thing you mentioned that's actually become a bigger thing now
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.880]   that airlines have changed the rules.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.040]   So, Southwest has always been this great airline.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.080]   You can book your flight, and you can cancel at any time, and you can get money
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.400]   back, or if you booked it with miles, you get your miles back, and it's great.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.200]   And now, a lot of airlines give you that flexibility too.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.480]   So, you know, one hack you mentioned is just, if you want to go on a trip,
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.920]   you could book it now and wait and see if a cheaper flare comes up.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.560]   - Absolutely.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.640]   You know, I mean, it's one of the best changes in policy that the airlines made
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:18.480]   in the past year was to get rid, permanently get rid of those change fees.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.680]   And so that if when you book a flight, you automatically get flexibility.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.720]   But one of the things to very much be aware of is that it only applies if you
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.160]   book in main economy or higher.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.200]   It does not apply to basic economy.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.840]   You're still pretty well locked into your dates if you book a basic economy flight.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.360]   And so, it's something to, you know, consider when you're seeing what the
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.280]   price difference is between main economy and basic economy.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.160]   If it's $5, if it's $10, yeah, I'll always buy up to main economy.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:51.560]   If it's, you know, $100, $200, then I'm sort of sitting there trying to get a,
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   kind of take stock and think, how likely am I going to want to change the dates later?
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.320]   How much do I feel, like, locked into this trip with the dates that I've already chosen?
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:02.600]   - Yeah.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.800]   And the add-on hack that I'll share is, let's say you're flying an airline that
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.480]   doesn't have that flexibility, or let's say you ended up buying that basic economy
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.240]   ticket, and you decide you're not going on the trip.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.120]   I always tell people, don't cancel it now, right?
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.480]   The difference between cancelling it the day you don't want to go and the day
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.280]   before you take off is zero.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.840]   And if any time up until the day you're departing, that flight is changed,
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.440]   cancelled, rescheduled, delayed, you can call the airline and say, "Hey,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.200]   I noticed my schedule changed.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.720]   It's six hours later.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.040]   I don't want to do the flight anymore."
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.640]   And, you know, I've tried.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.280]   One time I tried and the flight changed three minutes and there was no leeway.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.160]   - But if your flight changes by a few hours or if the schedule changes to a
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   different airport or a different day, you can get your money back.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:50.520]   - Yes.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.080]   This is one of the hidden best things.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.960]   You know, when you get that email, it says, you know, "Scott,
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.280]   your flight schedule has changed."
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.760]   Most people's heart was saying, "Oh, God, what a pain."
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.200]   You know, view that not as a bad thing, view that as an opportunity.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.440]   Because not even, like, yes, certainly if you want your money back, yes,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.400]   view that as, "Oh, this is great."
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.920]   Because, again, under U.S. law, you're eligible for a cash refund in full when
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.800]   that happens, when there's a significant schedule change.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.680]   But even if you don't want a refund, even if you still want to take the trip,
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.720]   you want your flights, when they make those schedule changes,
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.080]   what this means is that you can actually switch to a more convenient flight than
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.480]   you might have originally booked without having to pay any fair difference at all.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.840]   It doesn't matter if the new flight was, you know, is more expensive.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.720]   On most airlines, they'll let you switch to, you know, let's say your original
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.240]   flight was a connecting flight, but now with the schedule change,
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.880]   you'll actually generally be able to switch to a nonstop flight or to a better,
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.920]   you know, to flights with better times, even flights with better dates than you'd
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.160]   originally booked.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.520]   So, viewing this as an opportunity to get a much better flight than you'd
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.440]   originally booked.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.520]   - Yeah.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.520]   My example was, and this was a miles trip, we booked miles to the Seychelles
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   for our honeymoon, and I got an email that Air France doesn't,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.640]   is no longer flying to the Seychelles.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.400]   And I told my wife and she was like, "What are we going to do?"
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.480]   I was like, "This is good."
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.320]   So, we called the airline and we had booked it in business class and the airline
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.960]   rebooked us in Emirates First Class, which...
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.640]   - Please tell me this wasn't the shower in the sky, was it?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.600]   - So, it wasn't the shower, but it was the private suites.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.280]   So, like you had a door, which actually on our honeymoon, I was like,
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.320]   "Well, I'll see you later."
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.800]   Like, you have your room on the plane, I have my room on the plane.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.240]   But, you know, it was, to many people, the idea of your flight getting canceled
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.560]   or rescheduled is terrible.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.160]   For us, we basically upgraded from a ticket that, I mean,
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.360]   Emirates First Class would have been probably $10,000.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.760]   - Can I ask you this?
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.680]   So, generally speaking, I've only flown in like business or first class
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.160]   internationally a couple of times.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.480]   So, I'm like, enough to be aware of how swanky it can be, you know,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.000]   the fly-flat seats, the champagne, the whole works, but not enough that it's
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.360]   become like an expectation.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.480]   Has it?
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.520]   And the reason why I haven't done it in a lot of ways, you know,
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.760]   because I love playing the points and miles game, but the reason why I'm almost
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.680]   hesitant to do it is I'm worried that it's going to become a sort of lifestyle
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.240]   inflation or lifestyle creep where all of a sudden flying in coach to, you know,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.280]   Paris or wherever is going to feel really arduous.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.320]   And has that been the case for you or does it still feel however you're flying,
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.120]   it's totally fine?
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.080]   - No, no, it's gotten to be...
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.360]   I played the miles and points game so hard that it became so easy to fly
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.560]   in business.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.320]   And, you know, it was much easier when I had a job where I was running a company
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.920]   and I had a lot of expenses that I put on a credit card or I worked for a job where
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.080]   I traveled a lot.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.920]   I do neither of those things now.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.840]   So while I have a lot of points today, I don't accumulate a lot more points.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.920]   So I'm dreading the time in the future where I've exhausted my points and I don't
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.800]   know what I'm going to do.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.720]   Like, I've gotten too accustomed that, you know, I...
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.880]   Unless it's a short direct flight, you know, I try to use points to upgrade.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.720]   I've never paid for it.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.280]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.680]   - I've never bought a business class ticket.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.600]   - They were like really expensive.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.800]   I mean, you know, with the occasional exception.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:32.440]   Like, I'm not sure folks necessarily realize how expensive trans-oceanic
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.760]   business class flights are.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.040]   I mean, we're talking not like three or four times, not like double the price,
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.240]   like five, six, seven times the price of an economy ticket oftentimes.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.200]   - Yeah, Japan could be $600 in coach and $8,000 in business sometimes.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   - Easily, easily.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.760]   Yeah, and so part of that is like why I've kind of pumped the brakes on like even
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.520]   considering business class, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe, who knows,
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.160]   maybe ask Scott when he's like 50 years old and be like, "Oh, yeah, I need a little
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.360]   more comfort in this guy."
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.680]   But I've always been like a little wary of like letting myself drink from that
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.440]   milkshake too often because I'm like worried like, "Oh, man, now coach flying
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440]   is going to be terrible."
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.360]   - I think that's a wise move and I encourage everyone to follow.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.000]   - You're just trying to keep all the award availability open for yourself on
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.440]   business class and all the others.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.080]   - Well, I mentioned Miles.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.200]   I know you don't talk a lot about Miles in the book until the end.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.040]   And I thought it was...
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.720]   You know, we did a whole episode about credit card points and Miles.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.800]   And the advice I thought was really salient, which was, you know, it went into
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.600]   a lot more detail.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:43.200]   But at its fundamentals, it's if you have flexibility and you're an okay flying
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.960]   coach, like points in Miles, you might not need them to get a good deal.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.800]   If you want to fly business, I mean, you're going to be waiting for years.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.680]   If your requirement is, "I want to go to Japan in business class and I want to
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.560]   spend less than $1,000," I don't know if it'll ever happen.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:04.880]   But so I loved the takeaway, which was, if you want to fly business class and you
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.240]   want to get a really good deal, Miles might give you that leverage.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.000]   Because the way I kind of describe it is mile...
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.120]   Or in the dollars game, a business class ticket might be 5 or 10 times expensive.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.600]   And in the Miles game, it's like two times as expensive.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.720]   So you get a deal.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.400]   But when you're trying to fly in a cheap domestic or a cheap domestic flight, or
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:29.840]   you're flying in coach from New York to London, gosh, just the taxes on some of
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   these Miles tickets are more than the coach ticket.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.400]   - Absolutely.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:32.960]   Absolutely.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.720]   You know, and not only that, but I think this is one of those incidental
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.520]   byproducts of now living in the golden age of cheap flights since, you know,
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.640]   2015 or so.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.280]   It's like, when I started out in the Miles game a decade ago, you just didn't
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.400]   see very many cheap, long haul, you know, intercontinental flights the way you do
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.480]   now that they're being so regular.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:59.920]   And so Miles, you know, even me, I was flying mostly economy, entirely economy
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.800]   to, you know, Asia, Europe, South America.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.280]   But Miles were still were a great value because the tickets, the cash tickets
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.040]   might've still cost, you know, 800, 900 bucks to fly to Europe.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:17.120]   And so if I could spend just like 50 or 60,000 miles to fly in economy, I felt
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.440]   like, yeah, I'm getting pretty good value here.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.600]   But now, you know, if that same 60,000 mile ticket you can get for 300 bucks
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.880]   round trip, well, then it's a horrible value on Miles.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.400]   And to your point, where the real, I think, value, I think, in the points and
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.200]   miles game is in more of the premium seats.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.120]   And I think this is why you see a lot of the airlines starting to move towards
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.320]   devaluation, trying to make the business class and premium products more higher
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.600]   redemption rates because they're recognizing that, you know, this might have
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.800]   been a little bit too generous to be sustainable.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.120]   Now, there's still a lot of sweet spots around.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.160]   There's still certainly great ways to get value.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.360]   But it's been interesting to me to watch Miles go from something where I started
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.720]   my career a decade ago as being like especially lucrative for however you are
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.480]   flying to now than being, frankly, pretty marginal when you're flying economy and
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.080]   I think being much more of a value if you're flying in premium.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.200]   And, you know, you might, I try to tell people, yeah, you might get a better
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.600]   deal on business class using Miles, but you're always going to get more flights
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.880]   if you fly in coach.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.120]   So, yes, you could hack your way to get to a cheaper business class ticket to
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.640]   Europe, but you could also just take two trips in coach.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.040]   And so don't forget that the tradeoff is even if it's a good deal in business,
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.480]   that doesn't mean that it doesn't cost two or three times as many miles or
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.200]   dollars as it would to take more trips.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.440]   And one of the things you said in the book was people are happier who take
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.000]   more trips.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.360]   Absolutely.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.600]   And, you know, where like oftentimes those preferences, recognizing that can
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.960]   vary a lot with your age, with your what type of trip you're taking.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.360]   You know, when I was in my 20s, I would go to the ends of the earth to save a
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.760]   couple bucks because I was time rich and I was cash poor.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.600]   But now, you know, into my 30s, getting a little bit older, I feel like, you
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.760]   know, I'm much more willing to spend a little bit extra to get a nonstop flight
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.080]   to spend a little bit extra to have a more comfortable itinerary than and be
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.680]   able to, like, get home quicker and spend some time with my young daughter.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.160]   Whereas, you know, when I think back to this, sometimes this flight I took in
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.400]   my 20s to save a few, I think I saved $30 on a flight from Washington, D.C.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.440]   to Denver.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.560]   I took the scenic route.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.960]   I flew Washington, D.C. to New York, to Boston, to Chicago, to L.A. out to
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.280]   Denver just to save 30 bucks.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.880]   Now, the idea of doing that.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.840]   You got the story.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.240]   Exactly.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.520]   I got a great story out of it.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.080]   It was certainly a fun travel day.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   Now, the idea of doing that today sounds horrendous because I have a lot more
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.320]   things I'd rather be doing with my time.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.720]   But, you know, back then, it was really important to me to save as much money as
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.360]   possible and recognizing that, you know, look, different people are in different
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.480]   situations in their lives.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.520]   For a lot of folks, cheap flights aren't necessarily a vanity.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.160]   It might be the difference between being able to take a trip or not going at all.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:22.800]   You know, if when that $130 roundtrip flight to Milan popped up, that it wasn't
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.920]   as though I was deciding between that or an $850 flight.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.000]   If it was $850, I wasn't going to go.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.280]   But for $130, absolutely, I was going to take that trip.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.840]   And that's why prioritizing cheap flights and making them really the centerpiece of
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.520]   your travel means that you're able to take three or four vacations for the same
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.400]   price you used to be able to pay for one, and you wind up taking more vacations
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.680]   than you would have otherwise.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.000]   Yeah, I think if there's something that I've evolved from, it's I'm like
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.760]   optimizing for my own happiness.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.080]   So a cheaper flight means more vacations.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.720]   I think I mentioned to you last time we talked, there's this book called Happy
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.120]   Money.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.640]   And they always say, you know, pay in advance for things.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.400]   And you can savor it the entire time before you leave.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.960]   You know, when you're there, you don't have this bill at the end.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.480]   And so, you know, that doesn't mean prepay for the hotel three months out.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.800]   But maybe like a week before you leave or right when you get to check in, just
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.080]   be like, "Hey, can we just pay for this hotel right now so that when I check out,
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.200]   there's not a big bill?"
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.560]   One of the most fascinating things for me in delving into the research around
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.480]   travel and happiness for this book was running into research about the way that
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.400]   we tend to enjoy our vacations.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.440]   Where we think, you know, historically we think of vacation as just something you
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.840]   enjoy while you're on the trip itself.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.040]   But turns out that if you look at the studies that have been done on this, the
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.320]   research, we actually enjoy the anticipation of a trip more than we do the trip
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:44.640]   itself.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.840]   We say we're happier when we're looking forward to a trip, when we're daydreaming
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.680]   about those, you know, those cocktails on the beach and hanging out at that cafe
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.720]   in Paris and going bungee jumping in New Zealand.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.680]   Then we enjoy, you know, anticipating that and that excitement about what's
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.400]   coming for it.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.960]   Then we actually are on the trip itself.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.920]   And we enjoy the memories of doing those things after the fact more than we do
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.720]   the trip itself.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.320]   And so, you know, we certainly enjoy ourselves when we're on travel.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.760]   But recognizing just how powerful anticipation and memories are.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.000]   And so trying to, rather than booking a last minute flight and robbing yourself
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.400]   of that anticipatory joy, book yourself a flight months in advance and give your
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.680]   today self months to look forward to this flight.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   To be able to, you know, travel plan and daydream and just be excited about
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.200]   something that's coming up.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.960]   Here'd be a great hack I just thought of is just book your flight three, four
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.640]   months out and then sometime in the next three, four months, book the next flight
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.400]   so that even though you might only take two or three trips a year, if you could
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.760]   live in a world where you always have a next trip plan, you can live in that
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.280]   anticipatory period, which, you know, we know is happier.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.880]   This is one of the ways that I think that cheap flights are at their most
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.560]   powerful is that when you're taking, it's not just the money that you save,
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.120]   but the way that when you take three or four trips a year rather than one trip a
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.040]   year, because you've got a cheap flight rather than overpaying, what happens is
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.280]   that normal travel cycle, you know, when, if you're taking one trip a year, that
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.560]   trip is great, but then when you get back home, I mean, gosh, you remember that
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.600]   feeling of just a hangover of just like, oh, back to real life.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.960]   Got to get back to work.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.360]   We both have small, we both have small daughters.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.800]   I think when you get home from a flight with kids, I think it's just, you know,
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.320]   you almost need an extra day.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.600]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.520]   But the, the, when you have, when you're prioritizing cheap flights and you're
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.680]   taking three or four trips a year rather than one, you don't have that same sort
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.320]   of sense, like I'm get home and my vacation's done and it's going to be 11
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.160]   months until I travel again.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.200]   You have that sense.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.480]   Oh, I'm back home.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   I get to readjust to life and it's only three months until my next trip.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.160]   It's only four months until my next trip.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.680]   And I'm already back in the cycle where I've gotten, you know, if I haven't
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.800]   already booked that next flight, I'm about to, I'm seeing what great deals
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.120]   pop up and I'm giving, I'm getting back on this sort of hamster wheel of
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.680]   getting excited, anticipatory joy, travel planning and all that.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.400]   So it, it, it turns it from a sort of dreaded hangover cycle to one where
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.520]   you're just constantly excited about what's coming up around the corner.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.720]   And, and so obviously there's joy in the anticipation.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.640]   You talked a little bit in this, in the book about the, the peak end rule,
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.280]   which is, you know, how to maximize your joy on the trip.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.000]   Talk, can you talk a little bit about that?
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.400]   So this, this policy, this is this concept in, in psychology that the way
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.080]   we tend, you know, we talked about how memories of trip tend to, we, we tend
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.240]   to enjoy those even more than the trip itself in part because memories are
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.680]   forever memory, you know, you get to that, that, that, that trip that you
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.760]   took from Zambia to Tanzania, you know, you're only on that train for what, a
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.080]   couple of days, but you know, you've gotten to, to relive that after the fact
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:06.640]   for, for years, the way that we tend to remember our vacations are, are, are
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.760]   two things about them.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.960]   One, we tend to remember them how we felt at it's like peak emotional state.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.880]   So, you know, like you, you went bungee jumping in New Zealand, you went
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.240]   running with the bulls in Pamplona, you know, you ate some just incredible
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.920]   sushi in Japan.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.520]   You tend to remember the peak and you tend to remember what you did at the
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.080]   end of the trip, how you, how it kind of wrapped up.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.160]   And so one of the, I think with that in mind, knowing that human psychology,
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.000]   we tend to remember the peak and the end.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.920]   Give yourself something really fun and, and, and really exciting to look
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.880]   forward to on that last day, because if you can end the trip on a high note,
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   you know, you have a wonderful meal plan.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.280]   You've got a great tour planned so far, whatever it is for that last day,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.000]   that'll make your trip, that'll give your future self so many more happy
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.240]   memories to remember about that trip than if you ended the trip on just
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.280]   something, you know, kind of lackadaisical or just something, meh.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.800]   Give your schedule something really fun and exciting to look forward to as
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.920]   the last day.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.680]   And that'll give you a kind of your, your, your, your, your future self that
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.840]   much more to be happy about in its memories.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.400]   I talked to my wife last night, I told her this, cause I was like, we got to
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.440]   make sure on our next trip, we planned something for the last day.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.920]   And I said, do you remember when we went on our honeymoon, we went to the
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.880]   Seychelles in Paris.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.560]   And in Paris, we went to a couple of nice, like Michelin star restaurants.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.880]   And they were not on the last day.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.400]   They were on a random middle day.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.160]   And I was like, do you remember those meals?
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.440]   And what she remembered was she was like, well, I remember at one of them,
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.720]   you didn't have a sport coat and you had to borrow a sport coat.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.000]   And I remember at the other one, the chair was really old and you got a
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.680]   splinter and they treated you as if the splinter was like a broken arm.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.200]   They brought out gloves and, and I was like, yeah, but do you even remember
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:51.600]   the meal?
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.280]   Cause the meal was expensive.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.720]   Neither one of us could remember anything about the meal except being
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.440]   full.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.200]   And I was like, gosh, if we had had that meal on our last day, we would
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.720]   have remembered it for years.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.360]   And so I think that was so great.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.360]   And on my next trip, I am planning, you know, something epic for the last
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:09.860]   day.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:14.080]   The psychologist who, who, or I think he's behavioral economists who
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.320]   termed this idea of peak end rule.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.640]   He even shared a memory about how, when he was traveling with his wife in
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.440]   Switzerland, they, they, they were scheduled to have one more day, but they
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.560]   had this just really wonderful day, you know, great picnic hiking through the
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.200]   Alps.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.800]   They just had such a good time that they had the option of adding on another
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.680]   day, but they decided to actually let's cut our vacation a day short.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.840]   Like we wanted to end on this, on this high note, rather than kind of ending
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.560]   on a slump.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.360]   And again, robbing their future selves of that sort of joy of, of memories of
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:43.840]   the trip.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.520]   And so I'm not sure I would necessarily endorse like cutting short your
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.440]   vacation if you have a really great day, but at least trying to plan something
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.760]   really fun and nice to look forward to on that last day.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.000]   Any, any other travel hacks, tips, whether it's flights or, or any other
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.200]   aspect of travel that, that we didn't touch that people should know about?
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.160]   Oh boy, gosh, I could go on all day.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.000]   One of the, so there are a couple of things too that I like to kind of bring
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.880]   up as let's go with like kind of more bite-sized hacks here.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.240]   The 24 hour rule.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.800]   This is a federal regulation that many folks aren't necessarily familiar with,
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.960]   but that can be really a power, like one of the most powerful arrows in your
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.560]   quiver as a, as a traveler.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.840]   What the 24 hour rule is, is that when you book a flight, as long as you booked
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.400]   it directly with the airline, as long as it's at least a week out from travel,
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.840]   you automatically, from the moment you hit purchase are given a 24 hour window
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   when you can cancel that ticket and get a full refund, no questions asked, no
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.080]   penalties, no fees, no nothing.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.120]   And so what the 24 hour rule, where that it's just like, A, knowing that you
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.200]   have that in case you book a flight and, and I don't know, you decide the next
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.160]   day you thought better of it, don't want it, knowing that you can get a full
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.480]   refund, but B, the ways that it can really kind of put you in a prime
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.240]   position to scoop up a cheap flight.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.480]   So let's say that $202 Japan flight pops up again and you're, you know, oh my
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.920]   gosh, that's an amazing fare, really excited, but your significant other's
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.120]   at work and they're in meetings all day and you're not necessarily going to be
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.360]   able to get in touch with them to, you know, plan out to propose this idea to
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.400]   scope out some dates.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.360]   What you can do with the 24 hour rule in mind is just go ahead and book one,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.880]   you know, a week or go ahead and book three different possibilities for
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.280]   trips.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   Oh, you know, book one trip in March, one trip in April, one trip in May.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.200]   And then when you're knowing that this deal might not necessarily last very
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.120]   long, it could be gone in a number of hours.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.840]   And so if you wait to book until they're out back from home from work, it's
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.640]   probably going to be gone.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.880]   But if you lock in the price now, what you've done is you've essentially just
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.360]   frozen that price for 24 hours and you can decide that night when your
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.320]   significant other gets home, hey, do you want to take this?
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.040]   Should we take this $202 flight to Japan?
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.320]   And if so, should we take this one that booked in March or should we take it in
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.520]   April or should we take it in May?
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.880]   Or should we take all three by locking in the price?
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.960]   You know, you get to keep whichever one you want and you can cancel the others
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.680]   for a, you know, for free and get your money back.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.160]   And this isn't a refund or this isn't a flight credit.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:20.720]   Right, exactly.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.840]   This is a full credit, you know, refund on your credit card.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.760]   And it's not just, you know, a situation like that.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:32.160]   Let's say one of the cool things that the airlines do often is when they're
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.640]   cutting flights, cutting fares, they are oftentimes engaged in what's called a
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.360]   fare war.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:41.280]   So that happened with those flights to Japan where initially, I think American
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.920]   Airlines was offering like $500 flights from the U.S. to Japan anytime over the
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.880]   next year.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.520]   And then United responded with $400 flights.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.800]   And American responded to United with $350 flights.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.520]   And United responded with $250 flights.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.600]   And they just kept ratcheting down and down until they got to $200 round trip.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.880]   And so let's say you had initially booked that $500 flight.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.880]   Well, if the price drops down, as long as it's within 24 hours, you can just book
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.480]   that new flight at the lower price and cancel your old flight and get your full
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.280]   money back.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.240]   And so this is a way, again, knowing within the 24 hours is if the fare drops,
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.120]   if it's a, you know, direct flight rather than connecting, any type of better
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.400]   flight, you can take advantage of it within those 24 hours.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.000]   Tell me if this is possible.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.240]   Let's say I want to book this flight, and I'm not sure.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.760]   It's not a special deal.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.960]   I'm just going on a trip.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.840]   I need to go.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.640]   I book a flight.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.800]   24 hours later, fare's the same.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.080]   Could I just every day rebook the flight and cancel the other one and just keep
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.400]   going and basically have unlimited window to cancel until, of course, the fare goes
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.200]   up and then I stop?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.880]   That is a really good question.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.160]   So the way, here's the way that I would be thinking about that.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.480]   One, you're going to have to float the like you're as much as I wish they were.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.720]   Refunds are not instantaneous.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.520]   You know, it's going to be sometimes they can be weeks until that actual refund
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.960]   shows up in your credit card.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.800]   So each day you do it, you might have to be adding another, you know, $200 onto
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.320]   your credit card bill.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.920]   And so recognizing that it might be a little bit until you get that refund.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.200]   The other thing, too, is that the airlines do have language in their contract of
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.880]   carriage that sort of precludes what they would consider, you know, like essentially
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:36.080]   gaming the system, whether like I to me, this doesn't seem like in the system.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.200]   This seems like doing, you know, do it like just putting yourself in a good position.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:46.960]   But I could see the airline being like, you know, this is Scott keeps doing this
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.360]   booking flights, canceling them every single day.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.640]   He's not the type of customer we want.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.560]   Like airlines are allowed discretion to say, like, you're not allowed to buy flights
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.360]   with us anymore.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.640]   So I could see it.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.120]   It just I would like I would like to see somebody kind of execute it in practice before
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.720]   I gave a ringing endorsement.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.640]   But at a bare minimum, anytime you book a flight, 23 hours later, if that flight is
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.880]   cheaper, you should rebook your you should absolutely.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:21.120]   And to be clear, the way to execute this is to like book the new flight first and then
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:26.560]   cancel the old flight, because what you don't want to do is cancel your old flight and then
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.360]   book a new flight.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.400]   But by the time, you know, you've canceled the old one, book the new one.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.480]   I mean, remembering airfare changes sometimes by the hour, if not by the minute.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.640]   And so if you the worst case scenarios, you've already canceled the good deal you got, you
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.160]   go to book the new one, but the price suddenly jumped and you're all of a sudden left with
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.040]   no flights.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.640]   Whereas, you know, if you book the new flight at the lower fare, you go to cancel the old
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.160]   one and just, you know, the worst case scenario is you just got outside of that 24 hour window.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.040]   But even in that situation, you can just cancel the second flight that you booked and be no
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.080]   worse for the wear.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.600]   So yeah, making sure you kind of go in the proper order of steps here.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.680]   I can't remember which airline, but there's at least one airline that if you book that
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.280]   second flight and you put in your frequent flyer number, they say, nah, you already
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.280]   have a seat on that flight.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.920]   But the hack is just book the second flight with no frequent flyer number, cancel the
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.480]   first flight, go back and add your number to the second flight.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.920]   Yeah, I like that a lot because you can always add in your frequent flyer number later.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.200]   You can always add in your TSA pre-check number later.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.800]   You don't have to do it right when you book.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.400]   I feel like we have a ton of hacks.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.880]   The other hack that I read in the book that I loved was if you're going to look for a
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.000]   flight for a family, right?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.120]   You had three or four people.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.320]   Sometimes you search for a flight for four and you realize, wow, when I was just looking
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.080]   for one, it was cheaper.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.840]   You know, there are times where it can be helpful to have your itinerary all booked
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.720]   together.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.440]   But sometimes there might be three seats at a cheap price and the fourth seat is really
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.240]   expensive.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.440]   And when you try to book all four, you're going to pay the expensive price four times.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.840]   So definitely play around with searching for one passenger and then four.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   And it could be cheaper to book two or three people at one fare instead.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.720]   That's exactly right.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.400]   You know, I did that on a recent flight from Portland to New York where I was traveling
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.320]   buying three tickets when I searched for one ticket.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.880]   Actually, when I searched for two tickets, it was $117.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.480]   But when I searched for three tickets, it was $177.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.160]   And so by buying two tickets at the $117 price and then buying the third ticket at $177,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.160]   I was able to save $120 off of what I would have otherwise paid.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:40.000]   Now, the reason why is, again, like you said, airlines want to, when you book multiple tickets
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.600]   on a single itinerary, they want to put it all in the same fare bucket.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.200]   So in my case, they only had two tickets left at that $117 price.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.440]   So if I wanted to buy three, they had to all be at the $177 price.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.400]   But what does it matter?
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.200]   You know, you're still in the same seats like we talked about earlier.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.600]   You ask the person sitting next to you what they paid.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.880]   Probably a very different fare.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.120]   This is a good example of why that can be the case.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.520]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.000]   Scott, I feel like we covered a lot.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.320]   I really appreciate you being on here and helping everyone take more vacations, get

[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.520]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:34.080]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.400]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.680]   to save a dollar.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.840]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.960]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.240]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.480]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.520]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.120]   employer's retirement plan.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.800]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.520]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.360]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.040]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.120]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.840]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcast, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.760]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
