[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:08.880]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.280]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.140]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there is.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.000]   And today I want to learn everything I can about getting the cheapest flights.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.720]   So today I'm talking to Scott Kies of Scott's Cheap Flights, an email service
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.940]   he founded in 2013 that now has over 2 million members and helps them find
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.760]   incredible deals on flights every single day.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.160]   He's also the author of the bestselling book, Take More Vacations, a guide to
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.980]   search better, book cheaper, and travel the world.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.760]   In our conversation, we'll walk through finding and booking the cheapest flights,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.760]   how to travel more and be happier, what you need to do exactly when your flight
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.720]   gets canceled or delayed, and Scott will share his Greek island trip, which
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.600]   doesn't just work for Greece, but can save you over a thousand dollars on
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.720]   international trips.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   So let's jump in.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.960]   Well, after I play this obligatory reminder.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.640]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.520]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.240]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.680]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.920]   Scott, thank you for being on the show.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.280]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.160]   Great to be with you, Chris.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.400]   And thanks for writing the book.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.360]   I just read the book.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   So I actually binge read the book over the last two or three
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.840]   days, and it's fantastic.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.520]   Well, listen, you're catching me not 12 hours after I got news that it hit the
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.080]   national bestseller list.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.240]   So if I seem like I've got a little bit of a glow about me today, if there's a
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880]   little pep in my voice, that's why.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.400]   Wow.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.080]   So now we upgrade the podcast.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.640]   We're now talking to a national bestselling author.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   I got to make sure we fix that in the intro.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.080]   I need to upgrade my self-image too.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.120]   You know, I thought, Oh, you know, I just got, no, no, I get to say I'm
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.960]   national bestseller.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.000]   Look, it, it, it, it feels something that's like, I never could have
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.280]   imagined that this would happen.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.600]   So the amount of just gratitude for folks who went out and got the book and are
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.680]   excited to read it is endless on my part.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320]   Well, congratulations.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   I think travel is one of the most incredible things you can do with your
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   time.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040]   So I love that you're helping make it easier.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.840]   How did you get into all of this?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.520]   It was very, very serendipitous.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   You know, I was not one of those folks who always knew they wanted to be an
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.360]   entrepreneur, not one of the folks who was like, Oh, I definitely want to, you
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.640]   know, have a startup when I grow up and just looking for that million dollar idea.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.080]   I was the exact opposite.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.240]   I never thought about getting into entrepreneurialism.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   I was a journalist.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.040]   I was a political journalist based in DC and somebody who did not have much money
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.400]   in his bank account, but still wanted to be able to travel.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Like I wanted to be able to go over to Europe and go over to Asia and Africa.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.760]   And I knew that folks out there somehow were getting cheap flights, but every
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.200]   time I would look and every time I would search, it seemed like those flights were
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.280]   really expensive.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.040]   Like they were, you know, I mean, just, just ungodly sums of money that made
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   international travel, frankly, out of the question for me until I started to really
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.160]   kind of immerse myself in this, you know, really kind of put on my journalist hat.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.880]   Why are flights so volatile in price?
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.320]   Like, why is it that this, you know, flight will be expensive today and then cheap
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.800]   tomorrow and then really expensive the next day.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.320]   I just threw myself into this world and it all culminated in 2013 when I got the
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.800]   best deal that I've ever gotten in my life, which was nonstop from New York
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.760]   city to Milan for 130 bucks round trip.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.240]   Wow.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   The funny thing about that flight was that I woke up that morning with zero
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.280]   intention of searching for flights to Milan of booking a trip to Milan.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.760]   But when I stumbled across that deal, I mean, gosh, there's basically nowhere in
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.440]   the world I wouldn't go for 130 bucks round trip.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.360]   Right.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.640]   And so I took this trip, had an amazing time, you know, and skiing in the Alps
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.600]   and went hiking in Cinque Terre and I went to an AC Milan match.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   It was, it was awesome.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   When I got back from this trip, all my friends and coworkers kept coming up to
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.600]   me, Hey, Scott, I heard about that great deal.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.920]   You got, Hey, listen, next time you get a deal like that, can you let me
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.560]   know so I can get in on it too?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.160]   And so rather than trying to remember every single person I was supposed to
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880]   let know, next time I found a deal, I was like, why don't I just start a simple
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   little email list and this way I can let everybody know at once.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.360]   And that's how, that's how Scott's cheap flights began.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   But it was just, you know, for the first two years, it was just a hobby.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.000]   Just something I did for the love of the game until at one point in
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   2015, it had grown large enough.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.520]   Friends are telling friends, people were signing up.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.000]   They had grown large enough that this hobby of mine graduated out of the free
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.280]   tier of MailChimp and all of a sudden they started asking me for 50 bucks a
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.040]   month to send emails about cheap flight alerts to my friends.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.280]   And so I was sitting there, ah, I don't want to pay MailChimp 50 bucks just
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.400]   to do this thing I used to do.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.520]   But then it also dawned on me, wow, there's a real hunger for this thing.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.680]   There's a real demand for, for cheap flights, surprise.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.920]   And I wonder if there's a business opportunity here.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.440]   And so that in 2015 is when I first started exploring how do I
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.240]   turn this into an actual company?
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   And how many people work at Scott's cheap flights now?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.360]   Right now there's close to 40 people on the team, which is again, as somebody
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.480]   who never intended to start a company or become an entrepreneur is totally surreal.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   And is that mostly, is that mostly people researching deals to try to
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.200]   create content for your, your emails?
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.600]   It's not, you know, we've got our flight search team is about six folks.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.280]   And then the rest of the team are, you know, people doing member success,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.920]   folks doing marketing, folks doing building the product and engineering
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.880]   and design all this, you know, run the gamut of, of different parts of the
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.560]   company, but the, the folks doing those flight searches and really kind of
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.760]   keeping their eyes, that radar going for whenever cheap flights pop up.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.520]   I mean, that that's the real core of things because they are doing just
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.440]   Yale, Yale person's work every single day to make sure that when those great
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.240]   deals do pop up, we don't miss them.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.560]   And our members don't miss them.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.880]   So, so I read the book and it dawned on me, right?
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.280]   Your, your mission is take more vacations.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.320]   Why, why do you think people aren't taking more vacations?
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.280]   Yeah, this, so this was the central question that kind of prompted
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.840]   my curiosity to write this book.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.880]   Most of us, when you look at survey data and you ask folks, most of us say that
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.720]   we want to travel way more than we actually do, you know, and not only go
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.520]   up and ask somebody, would you like to take another vacation?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.320]   Absolutely.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.080]   But you see it in a new year's resolution data.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.560]   One of the top things every single year, I want to travel more.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.840]   When you ask older folks, what do you wish you had done?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.760]   You know, what are your regrets?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.120]   What do you wish you had done more when you were younger?
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.520]   It's almost always travel more, see more of the world.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.840]   And so I said, well, we all have this real hunger to travel and take more trips.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   What is it that's stopping us?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.440]   And so I figured, look, there are two main things, time and money.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.200]   I can't give you more time, but I think it's a little bit overrated the extent
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   to which a lack of time is curtailing our vacation ability, because when you look
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.720]   into the data of how people use their vacation time, if assuming you do have a
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.160]   job that gives you paid time off, most people are not using their full allotment
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   of vacation time, over 50% of people leave vacation days unused every single year.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.560]   You know, collectively we leave about a billion days of vacation unused
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.400]   every single year as Americans.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.040]   We, it's not for lack of time.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.480]   I think it's the headache and expense and uncertainty of booking flights
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.280]   that's stopping us from traveling more.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.480]   You know, the mental experiment that I like to propose is imagine you could snap
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   your fingers tomorrow and all flights anywhere in the world were just 200 bucks
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.360]   round trip, where would you go?
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.680]   How many trips would you take?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.840]   I think for most people, they would go, you know, go to, to, to Brazil.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.760]   They'd go to Spain.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.680]   They'd go to Japan.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.400]   They'd go to Australia.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.000]   They'd go to Botswana, like all these amazing places around the world.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.200]   And I think we would take far more trips than we actually do right now.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.920]   I think people will be taking three or four or five vacations.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.280]   Whereas right now they might be taking just one every single year.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:34.200]   And so it dawned on me, if you can master cheap flights, and if you can all of a
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.280]   sudden get over that hurdle, learn how to not overpay for flights, but learn how to
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.320]   really take advantage of the cheap flights that are all around us, then you're able
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.640]   to take more vacations, you're able to take better vacations, happier vacations,
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   and you wind up enjoying yourself more, not only on the trip, but when you get back
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.280]   as well.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.720]   And so this book was this culmination of me realizing, folks, like I wanted to kind
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.800]   of convey not only how to find cheap flights, but the myriad ways in which they
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.640]   are truly life-changing and how they can really change the way you travel and the
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.160]   way that you go through life and be able to avoid that situation where you, you
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.120]   know, grow up, get old in life and look back and wish you had traveled more when
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.720]   you were younger.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.000]   That's what I'm trying to give folks the ticket and permission to do now.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.360]   I mean, I've traveled, I'm trying to take a trip every year overseas at least once
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   a year and small trips around, around the country or North America, shorter.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   I know that one of the coolest things, my sister went to college and I had learned
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   a while ago that only, only like 50% of Americans have a passport.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.000]   And I just recently saw last month, another survey said only 37% of Americans
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   have a valid passport.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.120]   And I thought, well, that's a huge barrier.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.880]   And the coolest thing about the school she went to was they had a fund.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.600]   Someone made a lot of money and donated a fund to the school to give everyone a
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.080]   passport.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.520]   So when you went to college, if you didn't have a passport, some wealthy man or
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.680]   woman or family or endowment decided we're going to donate enough money so that
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.040]   every kid has the ability to travel internationally when they graduate.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.120]   And so I'm a huge fan of that.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.360]   I thought that was so cool.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   I, I, I love that because not only is it such an incredible world out there, I
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.720]   mean, yeah, certainly within, within our own country, but outside it too.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.240]   I mean, there's so many amazing life-changing places, but travel, you
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.440]   know, one of the chapters of devote to this is this fact that travel is medicine.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.720]   It leads to happier trips, more of them, folks who travel see huge boost down to
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.040]   their own personal wellbeing.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.400]   They're healthier, they're happier.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.080]   They're more professionally successful.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.120]   They're more likely to get promoted at work.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.680]   All of these things that really kind of give us a boost in our wellbeing, just by
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.520]   being the type of person who is taking those trips, who's going to, you know, to
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.880]   Europe and South America and Latin America and far be it from the situation that
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.960]   existed decades ago, where travel is something that only existed for the rich
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.680]   and the wealthy, we are living right now in the golden age of cheap flights.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.680]   It has never been cheaper to travel overseas as it is right now.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.360]   And so I want to like, make sure that folks know the good news.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.960]   You know, this is why I'm out here preaching the gospel of cheap flights,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.600]   because if you realize, I don't have to pay a thousand dollars to fly to Europe.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   I don't have to pay a thousand dollars to fly to Asia.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.760]   I can get those flights sometimes for as little as, you know, just a couple of
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.960]   weeks ago, we saw flights from the US to Japan for March of next year, for March
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.800]   of 2022, for 202 bucks round trip from all over the US.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.000]   And so if you can put yourself in a position to get those flights, I used to
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.240]   pay more to fly home, to visit my folks in Dayton, Ohio, than I would have paid
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.640]   to fly to Japan for this trip.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.880]   And Japan is amazing.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.640]   If you have not been to Japan, anyone, like it is one of the most amazing
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.000]   travel experiences you can have.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   I often get asked, you know, where's your favorite place to travel, Scott?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.520]   And, and I hate picking, cause you know, it's like picking between your children,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.400]   but if I'm forced to, it's always Japan and Mexico, like those two places in my
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.360]   mind, if, if I can only go to two other countries outside the US, it'll be those
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.680]   two.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.040]   I have a, Japan's always at the top of my list.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.680]   If you have a time machine or, you know, to go forward or backwards, Syria was,
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   was a top country for me.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.400]   I'm not saying Syria is a great place to go right now, but 10 years ago we went
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.280]   and it was incredible.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.040]   And I, I'm optimistic that sometime in the future it will be another great
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.560]   travel destination.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.520]   So that must've been like just before the war.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.760]   It was unintentionally, it was in 2010.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.360]   Wow.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.600]   Like really the year before.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.480]   That's amazing.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.400]   But a wonderful country, amazing people, so hospitable.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.120]   So, okay.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.200]   So $200, is that a target?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.800]   If you told someone, if you really want to get serious and you want to travel
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.040]   overseas, should they be waiting for $200 fares?
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.400]   Is there a sweet spot where you think like, this is kind of what you should
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.640]   expect if you're, if you're kind of flexible?
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.440]   So the way that, the way that I would think about it is that you have three
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.760]   main areas of flexibility and the more you don't have to be fully flexible to be
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.240]   able to get cheap flights, cheap flights are not something reserved for, you know,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.080]   22 year olds who have no obligations whatsoever.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.040]   Cheap flights are there for all of us, but the more flexibility you can give
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.760]   yourself, the better your odds of getting a good deal.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.720]   So there are three main areas of flexibility.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.440]   There's where you travel, there's when you travel, and there's
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.920]   when you book your flights.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.160]   And so even if you say, okay, I really want to go to Japan, if you can give
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.920]   yourself a lot more flexibility on those other two areas, say, I want to go to
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.000]   Japan, but it doesn't matter when I go, I'll go whenever the cheap flights pop
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.720]   up and I'll book when they, you know, when those flights do pop up, rather than
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.240]   saying, I have to book my flight this week or I have to book my flight next week.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.920]   That's how you put yourself in a good position because when those $202 Japan
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.960]   flights popped up a few weeks ago, there was no way of knowing in advance that
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.320]   those deals were going to pop up.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.720]   We had nothing, you know, there was nothing in the literature.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.480]   There's nothing in the historical data.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.400]   There's no way to say definitively, this is where that next
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.640]   cheap flight is going to pop up.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.320]   I can guarantee you they will pop up.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.880]   You know, I've been doing this job for six years and every single day
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.600]   we see cheap cheap flights pop up.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.720]   But where that next one will be and when, when it will be available for it, it's,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.760]   it's impossible to say in advance.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.560]   So the more flexibility you can give yourself in certain areas, the better
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.240]   your odds of still getting a good deal.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.680]   Even if you don't have to say, I'll go anywhere, anytime you can say, I want to
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.160]   go to Japan, I'll keep my dates open.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.120]   I want to travel somewhere over the summer because maybe I've got kids in
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.080]   school or I've got, you know, I'm a teacher, this is the only time I can
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.960]   travel, but I'll keep my destination open because that way I'm still giving
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   myself the best odds of getting a cheap flight, thinking of flexibility less as
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.640]   a binary, less as an on-off switch and more of as a dimmer switch is going to
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.360]   be how you put yourself in a good position to get those great deals.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.920]   And if someone said, okay, I want to go to Japan, you know, is this the kind of
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.640]   thing where a cheap flight to Japan, maybe not all the way to 200, but let's
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.280]   say like, you know, not a thousand dollars, you know, maybe four or five,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.920]   $600.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   Do you think they have to wait on average a week, a month, a year, two years?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.560]   How, how often do kind of the average destinations show up on the, the really
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.040]   good deals?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.360]   Yeah, great question.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.040]   It depends.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.240]   Uh, it depends a lot on where you're flying and where you're flying out of.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.560]   So if you are in a big city, you know, New York, LA, Chicago,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.000]   San Francisco, they definitely get the highest quantity of deals.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.640]   One of the things I actually argue in the book is that small airports like
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.280]   Dayton, like my home airport growing up of Dayton, Ohio, actually get the best
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.200]   deals because the normal price of flying, let's say somewhere like Dayton to
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.280]   Tokyo, normally that, you know, $2,000 or something more, but in that deal, in
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.200]   that Japan deal, a few weeks ago, there were flights available from Dayton,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.600]   Ohio to Tokyo, Japan for 233 bucks round trip.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.640]   And, you know, that's a far better deal than even the $202 round trip flight
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   from New York to Tokyo, because New York to Tokyo is a, is a fare that you would
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.280]   normally expect to pay a lot less for maybe a normal time, you know, 800 bucks,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.160]   900 bucks.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.080]   And so that $700 drop, it's excellent.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.680]   Don't get me wrong, but it's nowhere near the, you know, $1,700 drop, like
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.160]   you saw with the Dayton flights, but so flights to Japan, they've actually been
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.440]   popping up a little bit more often lately than they have historically, obviously
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.000]   you can't go to Japan today and we don't know exactly when it'll reopen for
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.200]   tourism, but the good news is that most of those flights have availability all
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.800]   the way through March, 2022.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.560]   And so if you, you know, book it now for 10 months from now, I think, A, there's
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.920]   a very high likelihood that things will be open by then.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.280]   And B, even if they're not, the airlines are giving flexibility now so that when
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.240]   you make a new booking, you can change your dates without any penalty to do so.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.600]   You, you can, you know, it used to cost five, six, $700 to change your dates.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.560]   And now you can just do so without any penalty.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.440]   If, if the new dates you switch to are more expensive, you have
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   to pay the fare difference.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.760]   But if the new dates are cheaper, you actually get the difference back in
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.920]   the form of a travel credit.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.320]   So all the more reason to be prioritizing cheap flights.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.120]   But when, you know, how frequently cheap flights pop up depends
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.080]   a bit on the destination.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   We see it, you know, almost every day to, to, to Europe and especially
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.640]   Western and Southern Europe, almost every, you know, ever, certainly every
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.800]   week to like the Caribbean and Latin America where you see it a little bit
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.160]   less common is parts of like Southern South America, most of, of Africa,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.000]   Oceania, you know, Asia, like sort of Australia, New Zealand, it's
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.560]   not that deals never pop up there.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.840]   They certainly still do maybe once every, once every month or two, but
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.120]   because there's just less lights between the U S and those places that there's
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.600]   less competition that tends to drive the availability of cheap flights in the way
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.080]   we see to like Europe and domestic travel and Hawaii and Japan and places like that.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.880]   But it sounds like if I had a goal to go to New Zealand sometime and I could book
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.920]   it anytime in the next 12 months and I'm paying attention, I could probably find
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.640]   a deal once a year.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.120]   Oh, a hundred percent.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.880]   I mean, if you put yourself in a position by giving yourself that much lead time,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   you say, I'm going to monitor over these next 12 months and get a good, you know,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.920]   and, and, and be patient when the flights are expensive, but pull the
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.680]   trigger when flights are cheap, there's basically nowhere in the world that you
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.800]   can't be able that you wouldn't be able to visit and get a cheap flight doing.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.960]   So now, you know, not all cheap flights are going to be equal.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.480]   You're a, you know, we regularly see flights from, let's say basically all
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.520]   over the U S to Barcelona for like 300 bucks round trip.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.120]   You're not going to very often see a $300 flight from the U S to New Zealand
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.760]   or the U S to the Maldives, but you know, when the normal price from the U S to
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.640]   New Zealand is $1,500, you can count on finding that deal some point over the
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:37.320]   next 12 months for, you know, 700 bucks, 600 bucks, sometimes maybe even 500.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.280]   If we'll get really lucky by giving yourself that much leeway, you're putting
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.600]   yourself in a really good position.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.320]   The analogy I like to draw is there's this saying among pilots
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.160]   that altitude is your friend.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.560]   You know, if, if, if there's a problem with the plane, if there's
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.800]   something wrong with the engine, you'd rather be at 30,000 feet than at 3,000
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.600]   feet, because you have a lot more time to fix it and just a lot more options.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.280]   If you're hoping to get a cheap flight, altitude is your friend.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.680]   You're going to have a lot better opportunity to find that cheap flight.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.920]   If you start looking 12 months in advance, then if you start
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.640]   looking a month in advance.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.760]   Okay.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.360]   So if in, in the true flexible sense, that makes sense.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.320]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.480]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.120]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.160]   purchase, you can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.720]   know the best cards to use.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.880]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.560]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.440]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America,
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.960]   or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.240]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.880]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.560]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.160]   this without having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.640]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.680]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.560]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.960]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.320]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.000]   I get it.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.200]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.520]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.600]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.520]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.040]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.120]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.960]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.040]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.880]   you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.920]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.120]   to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.480]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.920]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.600]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.480]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.640]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.560]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.920]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.080]   Is there anything to do other than just sign up for Scott's
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.200]   Jeep flights and wait?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.600]   Are there other places you should be looking, other things you should
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.000]   do to get these Jeep flights?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.960]   Absolutely.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.640]   Absolutely.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.840]   But look, Scott's Jeep flights is there to try to make sure that you never
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.120]   miss when great deals pop up out of your home airport.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.320]   But it's still, you know, a lot of folks really love searching for flights,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.600]   really love poking around, seeing what's out there and the amount, like the
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.400]   number of tools out there to help with that these days is like, man, I wish
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.640]   these tools existed like 10 years ago when I first started traveling.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.120]   I was using ITA Matrix back in the day, it was a terrible tool, I couldn't.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.240]   Bizarre code lines.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.240]   Oh gosh.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.240]   It pains me now to think about it in retrospect.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.320]   So what are the tools?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   What's the toolkit for a person who wants to be a cheap flight
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.840]   hacker and find all the deals?
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.560]   Absolutely.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.440]   So the first and foremost, Google Flights.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.360]   Google Flights is one that like the hidden secret to know here with when
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.200]   you're searching for flights is that the price is going to be basically
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.760]   the same no matter where you search.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.600]   There's nowhere that like always has the cheapest flights.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.720]   It's just not despite all the, you know, millions of dollars in marketing
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.960]   and this and that, whether you search for your flights on Priceline or Expedia
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.680]   or direct with the airline or Google Flights, it's all going to generally
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   be about the same and so the way that I tend to decide where I want to do my
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.720]   flight searching is which one has the best user experience, like which one
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.200]   has what lets me search the quickest, most powerful, I can look at all my
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.760]   options and to my mind, it's Google Flights.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.000]   So, and the reason why I like Google Flights, lightning fast, you can search
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   not just one airport to one destination, you can search seven origin airports
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.760]   to seven destination airports and it'll show you the single best fare
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.080]   among any of those routes.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.720]   And so let me show, let me give you an example of how that's useful.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Let's say you live in Philadelphia, you want to travel to Europe this summer.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.240]   You don't care exactly where you go and you know, you know, as soon as you
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.960]   get to Europe, you can hop on a train, you can hop on a Ryanair flight
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.080]   wherever and get your final destination really cheap, you just want to get a
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   good deal flying across the ocean.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.880]   If you go to kayak, you'll have to search, you know, Philadelphia to Berlin,
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.600]   Philadelphia to Dublin, Philadelphia to Paris, Philadelphia to Rome and each
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.520]   time, you know, it's going to take 20, 30 seconds, like with Google Flights,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.320]   you get to search not only put in Philadelphia, but you get to search all
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.680]   three New York airports and all three DC airports, and you can say you can put in
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   seven different or seven different destination airports in Europe, say,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   okay, I'll check for flights to Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, London, you know,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.840]   I don't know, Barcelona, Madrid and Zurich.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.240]   And of all 49 of those possible routes, what Google Flights will do is it'll
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.120]   show you the single cheapest one across any dates over the next 12 months.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.960]   And so this way it makes it really simple to be able to quickly isolate what, what
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.440]   is the cheap flight that's available rather than having to do 49 separate
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.800]   searches, the way you'd have to do on some other flight search engines.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.360]   So that amount of flexibility and really being able to see quickly, what are the
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.080]   cheapest options is how a cheap flight lover like myself and like I hope I'm
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.040]   trying to convert many folks into that's the way you're going to get a really good deal.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.480]   And I also, I use Google Flights almost exclusively.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.560]   I like to, you know, you can say up to two stop, up to one stop, you know,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   depending on where you're coming from, you can say total travel time.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.120]   I think when you start getting into long international itineraries,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.480]   sometimes you might see these crazy 14 hour layover plus two changes.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.000]   So not only can you use that calendar to look at dates, but if you set those
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   rules, they refresh the entire calendar.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.520]   So that when you're looking, what is it like in June?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.560]   What is it like in July?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   They're filtering all that for only flights that are less than, you know, 30 hours,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.200]   which if you were flying from New York to LA would be crazy.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.560]   But if you were flying to Japan from Florida, it might make more sense.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.480]   Exactly.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.640]   And that's such a key thing that, you know, a lot of folks, when they first
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.800]   hear me ramble on about cheap flights, what they might be thinking in their
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.840]   head or what they might be saying to me is, Oh, these cheap flights, they
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.200]   must be terrible flights, right?
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.440]   Like it's all on spirit.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   It's always like five stops and 40 hours of travel.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.720]   No, no, no.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.040]   Cheap flights do not have to be inconvenient flights.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   You know, today's expensive flight might be tomorrow's cheap flight.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.760]   Those $202 round trip flights to Japan on a five-star
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.200]   airline with one stop on route.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.880]   You know, that $130 flight that I got to Milan was a nonstop flight on
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.000]   United with two check bags included.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Like cheap flights can absolutely be, be, be great flights.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.880]   And, and if you kind of tell yourself, Oh, if it's going to be cheap,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.320]   then it's going to be terrible, that's actually, that's a recipe for ending
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.640]   up getting really expensive flights.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.280]   Because if, you know, if you, if you resign yourself to only thinking
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.440]   expensive flights are out there, then you're not going to hold
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.480]   out for them being cheap.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.200]   You know, it's not the way hotels are where the price tends to reflect the
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.760]   quality, the price in a lot of ways on a flight is a completely independent
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.000]   variable to how good the flight is.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.400]   And so there was a game.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.880]   There's a game you mentioned in the, in the book, which was when you sit down
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.960]   next to someone, you know, ask them, Hey, how much did you pay for this seat?
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.720]   And you could be sitting in virtually the exact same seats.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.080]   Let's assume no one's in the middle.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.400]   So you're in aisle and window aisle and window.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.440]   Someone could pay five times as much as you did for your flight.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.160]   If you have a hundred people on a flight, chances are they paid a hundred
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.880]   different prices to be there, or at least like 98 different prices.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.800]   We think of, you know, a lot of folks get, I think, stuck in this category
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.280]   error of thinking of airfare as something that is static and stable, or
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.760]   thinking of that there, you know, I'll get asked, what does it cost to fly to
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.240]   London?
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.640]   What does it cost to fly to Tokyo or Miami or Hawaii?
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.520]   There is no one price.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.920]   You know, I, like the, the, my favorite fare that I can remember to illustrate
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.680]   this was a flight we were looking at from Atlanta to Amsterdam that on Monday
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.920]   was $800 round trip on Tuesday was $300 round trip.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.960]   And on Wednesday was $1,300 round trip.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.520]   And it was the exact same flight.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.960]   And so, you know, rainbows and gold coins to you, if you booked on Tuesday
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.080]   and got that $300 flight and, you know, it just like thunderstorms and, and, and
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.880]   woe to you if you booked on Wednesday and paid, paid four times the price.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.320]   And you mentioned these don't have to be on budget airlines.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   How do you feel about budget airlines?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.720]   I have, uh, my only, my only story for budget airlines, which is a spirit
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.840]   story was we went to Cartagena, Columbia for my bachelor party and spirit decided
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.160]   while we were at the airport, that they weren't going to fly to Columbia anymore.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.320]   Not just that day, but we called customer service as soon, as soon as we saw this
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.280]   line not moving and they were like, sorry, we don't fly to Columbia anymore.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.080]   And I was like, what do you mean you don't fly to like, you're just not going.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:50.320]   So we all, every single person had to buy a new flight or wait three or four days
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   until spirit would book you on their systems were not fast that that's like
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.720]   maybe the worst case scenario, but is there a place in, in cheap travel
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.120]   for these budget airlines?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   So your story exactly illustrates the way that I think about budget flight, budget
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.120]   carriers, I love budget carriers, but I basically never fly them.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.920]   And the reason why I love them is because it is thanks to the spirit airlines of
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.280]   the world and the Norwegian airlines of the world and the air Asia's that we are
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.240]   living in the golden age of cheap flights.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.000]   And the reason why is that competition between airlines, the number one
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.240]   determinant of cheap flights.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.040]   And so when spirit comes in and sees, Oh, you know, American, you're charging, uh,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.320]   $500 to fly down to Columbia.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.120]   What if, what happens if we come in and offer those flights for 200 bucks, most
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.840]   people are going to book those, that spirit flight, because when you look at
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.560]   survey data, by far, the number one variable, the number one determinant that
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.040]   people are using to decide what flight to book is just price is it's the, you
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.880]   know, it's a commodity.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.120]   They're not saying, Oh, I really like American.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.880]   So I'm going to pay $300 extra.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.360]   We're just like, this is just a means of getting from point A to point B.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.840]   So I want to go with what's cheapest.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.320]   And so this is why I love budget airlines, because by setting that $200
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.440]   price, they're forcing the other airlines, your Americans and your
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   Deltas and your Air Francis to drop their prices to compete.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.360]   You know, when, when, when Delta first rolled out basic economy fares about a
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.200]   decade ago, the original name for them on investor calls was spirit match fares,
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.960]   because this was how their way of trying to compete with them.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.600]   But why, so, okay, Scott, you love them so much.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.000]   Why do you never fly them?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   Well, for exactly the reason that that sort of nightmare scenario that you ran
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.560]   into, if something goes wrong, if a flight gets, you know, majorly delayed
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.800]   or canceled on a budget airline that has the, the potential of really
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.240]   upending your entire trip.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   And what I mean by that is if you had been booked on, let's say American
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.360]   airlines down to Cartagena, well, you know, even if American, even if that
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.440]   flight that you had been on got canceled, what they fly down to Cartagena, you
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.560]   know, four or five, six, seven times a day, they'll put you on a different
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.520]   flight, let's say, you know, or they'll put you on a partner airline in the
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.760]   region you get to fly on, you know, now you can fly on like jet blue down or
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.280]   anybody else that they're, they're, they're partnered with, whereas the
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.560]   budget airlines, they tend to a have very sparse schedules.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.080]   So maybe they're only flying a couple times a week to Cartagena B, they tend
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.760]   to not have partner airlines.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.400]   And so when that flight gets canceled, even if they had still continued,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.920]   been flying to Columbia, it might've been three days until the next flight
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.680]   there, and so all of a sudden you're, what, what am I supposed to do?
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.040]   Just cut three days off of my trip, off my vacation.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.480]   Yeah, stay at the hotel airport that they're putting you up in for $25 a night.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.080]   Horrible.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.600]   And then, and then, and then even if, you know, then you're in that worst
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.440]   case scenario of, you know, you get the refund from spirit, I got to imagine
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.600]   those last minute, you know, when you're booking those last minute, same day
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.880]   fares on another airline, those must've been incredibly expensive.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.600]   Like those must've been a, a horrendous price.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.120]   And so the potential for those really bad situations, like when something
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.800]   goes bad on a budget airline on your, your itinerary, it can go really bad.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.200]   Whereas the downside risk with the full service airlines tends
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.640]   to be quite a bit better.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.520]   You know, something goes bad, your flight gets canceled.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.480]   Usually it's only going to result in a few hours delay till you're getting
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.920]   to your final destination than you would have otherwise.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.720]   And when, you know, so totally agree.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.280]   I think if you're thinking about, Oh, I want to take a quick, quick trip
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.880]   somewhere, and if it, if there's a problem, it's not a big deal.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.400]   And I've got lots of flexibility.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.360]   Maybe it's fine.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.320]   Or if you live in a hub city for an airline, that's a budget airline, maybe
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.120]   it's fine, but I, I will not be flying budget airlines in the future in these
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.400]   kind of international scenarios that aren't country hubs, because
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.640]   that was just a disaster.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.880]   And you know, each trip is going to depend a little bit.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.040]   And to be clear, like, Hey, I think the actual onboard experience of most
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.640]   budget airlines is basically the same as, you know, if you're flying
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.960]   American, you're flying United.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.840]   I don't think it's going to be that drastically different.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   Uh, and B oftentimes actually budget airlines have more direct flights,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.760]   depending on where you're flying than many of the legacy airlines that
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.200]   do a more hub and spoke model.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.400]   So you always have to connect, you know, American through Charlotte
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.960]   or through Miami or whatever.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.360]   You might have more direct flights on the budget.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.800]   And, but, you know, seeing how often they're flying, if it's one of those
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.000]   things where it's international, it's twice a week, and so if my flight
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.760]   gets canceled, I am really screwed here.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.000]   Those are considerations that I'm taking into account when I'm trying
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.360]   to decide which flight to book.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.680]   And so, you know, look, if that Spirit Airlines flight is $800 cheaper
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.600]   than the American flight, yeah, I'm going to book Spirit, but if it's.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.000]   $50 cheaper, $25 cheaper to me, it's generally worth the premium to
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.640]   pay to, to be flying on a full service airline.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.480]   Yep.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.040]   And we talked a lot about flight gets delayed.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.080]   Flight gets canceled.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.320]   What are your tricks when that happens?
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   You're at the airport and you've just learned your flight is canceled.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.280]   What do you do that makes you better off than other people
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.000]   standing in line or waiting around?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.280]   Oh man, I like, I jump into like hyper organized.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.720]   This is like Scott and his peak superhero mode that flight gets canceled.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:21.920]   Okay.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.080]   First thing I do is I go find, you know, where the customer service airline is,
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.560]   and I go stand in it because I want to make sure that I'm getting as good a
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.200]   spot as possible in a case, in case my problem can only be solved by in-person
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.240]   agent, but generally speaking, folks, phone agents for the airline have just
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.560]   as much power as the people in person at the airport.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.600]   And so while I'm, you know, walking to that line, while I'm finding that
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.240]   customer service place and getting, you know, reserving my space in line, I'm
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:58.000]   calling up the airline and trying to get my ticket, you know, rerouted, trying to
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.280]   get a new flight directly with somebody over the phone, because that actually
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.240]   might end up being a lot quicker, especially if the line is long or
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.080]   there's no wait over the phone.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.320]   If I'm calling the main service line and they're saying, you know, an hour
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.960]   wait, two hours, wait three hours.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.840]   Wait, what I'm doing, you know, not sitting there waiting for that.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.680]   What I'm doing is I'm looking up then what are the international
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.280]   phone numbers for this airline.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.360]   So Delta doesn't just have, you know, offices in Atlanta, free to call.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.440]   They've got offices in Canada and in Mexico and in the United Kingdom and
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.840]   Singapore and all over the world.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.720]   And so, you know, you want to check what your own cell phone rates and
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.320]   policies are about international calls, but nobody really thinks to
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.680]   call Delta's Canada office.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.520]   But the Canadian agents for Delta can help sort out your itinerary just the
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.120]   same as an American agent could.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.360]   Without the whole time.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.600]   Yeah, and, you know, nobody else is calling them.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.240]   So you generally are able to get right through.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.480]   So those are the types of things that I'm doing quickly.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.920]   I'm also looking up and seeing what are my best alternative options.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.400]   You know, I'm pulling up Google flights, I'm seeing on this airline or any
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.520]   partner airlines, what other ways can I get to my final destination right now?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.640]   Irrespective of the price, take whatever fare it shows and just totally ignore it.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.280]   Because, you know, when your flight gets canceled or delayed or something, the
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.440]   airline just wants, they still have to get you to a final destination.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.040]   They're not charging you anything to put you on a different flight.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.680]   So just find out what flights look most convenient for me, what's best for my
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   schedule, because if you can come in prepared to that agent, "Hey, yes, you
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.600]   know, my flight just got canceled.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.120]   Can you put me on that next flight that goes, you know, through JFK and then over
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.960]   to Rome," they are much able, like able to help you more quickly.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.640]   I mean, look, they've got hundreds of people they're trying to take care of.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.240]   Your own, you're always going to be your own best advocate.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.280]   So the more information, the more preparation you can do before you get
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.880]   somebody on to help you, the better off you're going to be.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.320]   And then I, I think you probably said this in the book too, but
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.200]   it's something I've been doing.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.920]   If something goes wrong, I wouldn't demand it, but I would ask if there's
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.400]   anything you get for that, right?
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.080]   If the best flight's tomorrow morning, do you have a hotel?
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.360]   Do you have a meal voucher?
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.440]   Can I get food?
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.600]   If there's no seats in coach, can I have a seat in business class?
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.960]   Hey, even if there are seats in coach, can I still get a business class upgrade?
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.200]   You know, they might, they, they're less likely to do it when it's a, you
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.880]   know, I don't know, it's canceled for weather, thunderstorm, something like
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.080]   that, than if it's a sit, but if it's a situation where let's say your flight
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.280]   is oversold and they need a volunteer, you know, not only can you expect to
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.440]   get a voucher for some, you know, some amount of compensation, you should hold
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.200]   out for as much as possible, but you should absolutely be asking for those
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.480]   things.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.320]   Think of it like the secret menu at In-N-Out where they're not going to
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.200]   tell you, Oh, you can negotiate for a business class seat on the
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.640]   replacement flight you're given.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.680]   You can negotiate for a hotel room for tonighters or this or that, but if, you
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.080]   know, especially if the airline's in a desperate situation, you can a hundred
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.320]   percent ask for those things.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.040]   Worst case they say no, but best case you're going to get it.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.000]   And I've gotten upgraded to business class on flights that I've been bumped
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.400]   off of because again, when the airline is in that situation, oftentimes they
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.480]   don't have a lot of leverage because especially, you know, I mean, you
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.840]   remember the David Dow incident on United.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:29.320]   I mean, United lost tons and tons of money because of just the PR hit from
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.200]   dragging this poor guy off the plane.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.280]   Whereas if they had just then, Hey, we'll give you a first class seat.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.200]   We'll give you a thousand dollar voucher for your next flight.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.840]   Like, like you, even if you didn't get him to agree to it, somebody on that
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.440]   plane is going to take it.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.000]   And so remembering, you know, the leverage that you might have,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.280]   it's always worth asking.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.600]   And I, I actually go in and look whenever I'm taking a flight where I'm flexible.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.160]   I look how full it is.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.440]   I I've remembered a couple of times where I'm, you know, let's say I'm in the
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.000]   bathroom and then I hear them announcing like the flight might be sold.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.840]   If you want to do something, come to the desk.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   I'm like, no, I want to go.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.720]   So if a flight is full, I look at the seat map.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.320]   If you're flexible and you'd take a voucher, definitely go to that desk and
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.200]   say, Hey, I'm flexible if you need anyone.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.400]   So you're first in line, because if you wait until they make the announcement,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.760]   you might be fifth in line or 10th.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.160]   Yeah, it's a very, it's, it's very much a first come first serve environment
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.000]   where, where I'll oftentimes even, you know, if I think I might, that situation
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.320]   might exist, if I've got some flexibility, I'm hoping to get a decent voucher.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:40.040]   I'll sometimes just pick the seat that's closest to the, to the gate agent's desk.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.360]   And it, because I know if I'm that first one in line, I'm going to get the
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.040]   voucher rather than somebody else.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.760]   All right.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.720]   So I want to just jump through a bunch.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.200]   There are a bunch of travel hacks, both that I have that you put in the
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.320]   book that are all around flights.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.560]   But first, when do you book the flight?
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.440]   Is there a point in time where you're waiting when there's no flexibility, right?
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.760]   I have a family reunion and we're supposed to go and it's over the 4th of July.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.200]   It's, you know, right now, fares are expensive.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.440]   I've looked all the airports I can drive to all the airports nearby.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.880]   There's just nothing cheap.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.600]   You know, what do you do when there's not, you know, do I wait to the last minute?
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.280]   Do I just buy whatever it is three weeks out?
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.560]   How do you decide what to do when there's not flexibility?
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.120]   So first let me bust two myths around when is cheapest to book.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.880]   There's still the sense that a lot of people have that flights are
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.360]   cheapest to book on Tuesday at 1 PM.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.720]   You know, if you've ever heard that one or sometimes they'll say Saturday at
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.960]   midnight or some, you know, arbitrary time.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   This was true 20 years ago when airlines first started selling their tickets
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.000]   online because they would actually just load their fares on once a week.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.280]   And so if you were one of the first ones to book right after those fares got
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.720]   loaded, you might be able to get one of the, you know, only handful of
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.640]   cheap seats that they had available.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.960]   The problem is that that hasn't been the way that airlines have been
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.760]   pricing their tickets for years.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.120]   Nowadays, tickets are set in airfare set algorithmically, you know, it's set by
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.160]   these fancy big computers that are much more dynamic and airfare is changing
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.960]   every single day, oftentimes by the hour, if not by the minute.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.240]   And so rather than it being a preset time, like it used to be, there is no
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.320]   single cheapest time or no predictable cheapest time when flights are going to
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.280]   be cheapest to book, no like set time of the week, similar with last minute
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.560]   flights, you know, 40 years ago, you often could get a good deal if you
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.120]   waited to last minute because the air, you know, the thinking was, oh, the
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.720]   airline, if any seat that is unfilled on that plane, as soon as the door closes,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.320]   it's just lost potential revenue.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.800]   So they're going to want to slash the price leading up to departure to try
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.480]   to fill as many seats as possible.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.280]   What the, that used to be how the airlines did it again, 40 something years
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.840]   ago, but now what the airlines have realized is that the people booking
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.080]   those last minute flights, weren't these are travelers, it was actually
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.120]   tending to be business travelers and business travelers, not only did they
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.840]   make their plans late, but they didn't care what the price costs because it
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.160]   was their company paying, not them.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.520]   And so rather than slashing the price, the way the airlines could make the
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.280]   most money was by jacking up the price and gouging them for those last minute
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.400]   flights that business travelers love to buy.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.720]   So instead you've got a trip rather than waiting for two, you know, the last
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.240]   minute, or just saying, I'm going to book it on Tuesday at 1:00 PM, both
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.320]   with which are going to do nothing to help you get a cheap flight.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   The best way to think about timing of booking your flights is to think in
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.600]   terms of what I call the Goldilocks windows.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.400]   So not too early, not too late, just right in the middle.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   And if you're traveling, so the Goldilocks windows vary if you're traveling
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.000]   domestically or internationally, if you're traveling domestically, typically
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.680]   about one to three months before travel is when cheap flights are most likely
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.520]   to pop up for international travel.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.400]   It's more like two to eight months in advance is when those cheap flights
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.560]   are most likely to pop up.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.880]   If you're traveling during a peak travel period.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.720]   So like middle of summer, Christmas, New Year's, or I don't know, going
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.880]   to Dublin for St.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.920]   Patrick's day, you typically want to add a couple months to those
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.400]   recommendations because again, they're just such popular times that they're
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.880]   the cheap seats are liable to sell out even sooner, but thinking about those
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.200]   Goldilocks windows as when cheap flights are most likely to pop up.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.000]   That's how you put yourself in a good position to make sure that you are
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.400]   getting it when those cheap flights do pop up.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.480]   Yep.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.600]   And I'll put the Goldilocks rules and everything we talk about in the show
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.360]   notes at all the hacks.com.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   They're also in the book.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.800]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.160]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,

[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.080]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.920]   One of the, one of the other tricks.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.680]   So one of the challenges with flight prices, when you travel internationally,
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:11.800]   you know, this is that you can only go from the U like only Ryanair great low
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.680]   cost airline, all three, they don't fly to the U S you're never going to book
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.160]   a ticket from the U S that includes a Ryanair flight.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.680]   So I don't want to say never, but you're saying you can't right now.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:22.560]   You can.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.920]   So today you cannot.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   And you know, so my process was, you know, let's find a fare to cross an ocean.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.840]   And then let's find a fare to get where I want to go.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.480]   You've kind of have a term for it.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.120]   This is the Greek island trip.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   I, I, how does someone execute this?
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.320]   Well, yes, absolutely.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.440]   So let's say you want us to travel to Santorini this summer.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.600]   Look at, you know, Greece open for Americans right now, just
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.360]   beautiful, iconic destination.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.720]   If you go search for flights, let's say from New York to Santorini for the
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.160]   summer, chances are, they're going to be quite expensive.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.000]   I mean, regularly, you know, 1500 bucks, sometimes more, but instead of giving
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.800]   up that dream of visiting Santorini, the Greek islands, what you should do
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.440]   instead is check for flights from New York to Athens, because flights from
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.200]   New York to Athens regularly pop up for, you know, 400 bucks round trip, 500 bucks
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.520]   round trip, if you can get that $400 flight from New York to Athens, you can
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.560]   then all of a sudden buy a separate flight from Athens to Santorini for like
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.480]   50 bucks, or you can take a ferry for 50 bucks.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:32.080]   It is by combining, by, by, by combining that trip with two separate itineraries,
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.840]   you're able to, you know, get the same trip for a quarter of the price that
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.080]   you would have otherwise had to pay.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.920]   And the reason why is to your point, when you search from New York to Santorini,
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.920]   the way that the airlines and the way that the flight search engines want to
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.120]   sell you a ticket is they only sell you a ticket on an airline or its partners.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.800]   And no airline is currently a partner with Ryanair.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.840]   So you can't find that cheapest flight from Athens to Santorini.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.280]   It'll just have to be on a separate, you know, partner airline.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.480]   Sometimes the cheapest flight across the ocean on that airline might have
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.520]   the most expensive flight from, let's say, you know, Athens to Santorini.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.480]   And so it ends up being real expensive by, by crossing the ocean as cheaply as
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.280]   possible, and then adding on a separate transportation to your final destination.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.160]   That's how you execute the Greek Island trick.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.880]   And that's how you are able to get, you know, to these really kind of remote
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.600]   iconic places for 70, 80% less than you would have had to pay otherwise.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.920]   And plus the best, you know, best of all, because it's two separate
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.880]   itineraries, once you get to Athens, you could spend a couple of days in Athens,
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.640]   if you want, before continuing on to the Greek Islands, you can take that
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.560]   time, be able to make it a two for one vacation in a way that you wouldn't
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.400]   necessarily have been able to, if you had just booked one itinerary.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.080]   Yeah, but do leave enough time.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.680]   It is very likely that you will not be able to check your bags all the way through.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.080]   Yes.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.120]   So I would say if you're not going to take a day or two off, definitely
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.080]   leave enough time to go grab your bags, which you might have to do
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   anyways for customs reasons, but just know that when you book your flight
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.760]   separately, you know, maybe you're lucky if they happen to be partners
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.320]   that they'll, they'll connect your bags.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.040]   But often the answer is no.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.280]   That is very key.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.080]   And I'm glad you brought that up because not only do you need to, you
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.640]   know, consider bags, transit time, all that, but there's also the, the, the
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.520]   question of look on a normal flight.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.720]   When you have one itinerary, if a delay on your first flight causes
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.760]   you to miss your connection, well, the airline is still responsible for
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.120]   getting you to your final destination.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.320]   They'll put you on the next flight.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.760]   They'll get, put you on a partner airline.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.200]   But if you have this flight from New York to Athens, and then a separate
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.640]   ticket from Athens to Santorini, the first flight, the first airline
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.840]   has no responsibility for that second flight on a separate airline
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.480]   or your ferry tickets or whatever.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.520]   And so you want to give yourself enough buffer time, sometimes even
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.720]   as long as a day or two to make sure that, that even if there's a delay
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.520]   on your first flight, it won't result in you missing your second flight.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:02.480]   Yep.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.600]   And two sites I'll, I'll mention that you, you mentioned in the book for
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.000]   finding out what airports fly everywhere.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.320]   I think it was flightconnections.com, which I had not heard of.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.520]   I was actually using Wikipedia as the place I would go.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.560]   I'd look at an airport and see all the destinations.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   I went to Flight Connections and I was like, wow, this
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.960]   would have saved me so much time.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.080]   So that's a great place to say, if I can get myself to Paris,
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.320]   where can I go from Paris?
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.560]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.080]   So let me give you a personal example.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.560]   In a few weeks, I've got flights to travel over to Madrid.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.760]   And until, until this morning, until we got the good news that Spain will
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.800]   indeed be open by the time we're there, we had been wondering, are we
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.000]   going to have to fly somewhere else?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.520]   Are we going to not be allowed in Spain?
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.800]   And so I'd go on flightconnections.com and I would see where can I fly?
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.240]   Where can I get a nonstop flight out of Madrid to elsewhere that, you
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.200]   know, will be open for Americans?
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.960]   So seeing, you know, can I fly to Albania?
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.040]   Can I fly to Greece?
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.760]   Can I fly to Croatia on a nonstop flight?
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.280]   Because, you know, I've kind of figured, look, I've only got a week.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:00.960]   We're going to get there.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.480]   We'll be tired.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.600]   I don't want to have to take like two or three flights to
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.160]   get to a final destination.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.080]   And you also mentioned Rome to Rio, which I think helps.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.280]   Maybe it's not a flight.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.560]   Maybe it's a train.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.320]   Maybe it's a bus.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.960]   Maybe it's a, you know, a ferry.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.360]   A lot of options.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:20.280]   I used to use this site called seat 61, which was like all about trains.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.000]   And it was, I don't know if it's even still maintained, but it was
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.560]   really cool for very remote places.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.560]   And we took a 52 hour train ride from Zambia to Tanzania.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.760]   How was that?
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.680]   It was fun.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.120]   Man, like the train broke down for three hours.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.240]   We like got out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.080]   We went to a village and we just hung out and then they like, you
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.800]   know, pulled the horn on the train.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.120]   And we were like, I don't know if that's a one minute warning
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.160]   or a 10 minute warning.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.240]   So we just sprinted back to the train.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.080]   See, I love that.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   I not only do I love that, that, that story, but I think that's really
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.960]   emblematic of, I think it's in chapter 11, you know, we explored this
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.600]   idea of travel and regrets.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.320]   And oftentimes we have this sort of like anticipatory regret.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:05.360]   Oh, I don't want to go to, you know, Zambia or Tanzania because I don't
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.080]   necessarily know the language or the customs or will I like the food or
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.440]   what happens if the train that I'm taking breaks down when in reality.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.400]   You know, not only are you going to have a great time, but if something
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   goes awry, if something funny happens, even if it's kind of like annoying
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.880]   or stressful or not terribly fun in the moment, it's a great story afterwards.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.240]   And you have some awesome memories that wouldn't, wouldn't have necessarily
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.640]   been quite as salient or quite as fun to relay if it had just been a, you
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   know, a normal trip where everything went exactly to plan and you, you know,
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.560]   you didn't take, you didn't grow at all or get any interesting stories
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.040]   because you didn't risk anything.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.800]   I always say, leave some time on your trip to just explore and do things
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.960]   because you might not know that you want to do them until you get there.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.800]   And sure.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.720]   There are some trips, like if you want to go on a safari, it might be worth
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:58.600]   coordinating that before you go, but if you're just landing in Rome, don't
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.640]   plan every day, leave a lot to chance.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.200]   We rented a Vespa and rode around, didn't think to do that before we
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.720]   got there, but it was so much fun.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.440]   And especially, especially now with smartphones, like being able to just,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.000]   you're, you're, you're not there having to completely be, you know, stranded
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.680]   on your own in a country where you don't know anybody and don't know the
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.200]   language, your ability to be able to, to find stuff, to be able to find
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   restaurants, to see what's interesting near you, to get directions.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.880]   It is a much, much, much more possible and accessible now.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.120]   So you're able to kind of have that, have that ability, have that lifeline
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.240]   while also not, like you said, not overscheduling yourself, leave yourself
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.920]   open to serendipity and let yourself be able to kind of enjoy the
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.960]   spontaneity that travel can bring.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.080]   So I want, I want to get back to a few of these hacks.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.840]   I'll ask you a few, I'll share a few travel insurance, buy it.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.440]   Don't buy it.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.680]   My, I personally almost never buy it.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.600]   And the reason why I never buy it is that I'm already insured in ways
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.040]   that people hadn't necessarily realized.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.840]   So when you buy a flight, if the airline cancels or, or, or significantly
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.160]   changed your flight under us law, you're eligible for a cash refund period.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.400]   If the airline, you know, has a big delay or they mess up your bags or lose them,
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.080]   they're going to give you some amount of compensation and plus your credit card.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.400]   Whatever credit cards you paid for the flight with many credit cards
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.120]   automatically carry travel protections on them, as long as again, you use
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.960]   that credit card to buy the flight.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.200]   And so I always like to be very cognizant of the ways that I'm
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.440]   already automatically protected.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   And I don't necessarily want to buy something, pay extra to get
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.040]   protection that I already have.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.320]   Now, I think there are, you know, some, like a few types of trips, something
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.280]   like, you know, a big safari where maybe you had to prepay for the safari.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.520]   And if the flight, you know, got delayed and you missed it, you're not going to
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.560]   be able to get your money back from the safari itself.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.560]   There are some instances like that when I think, uh, insurance can make a lot of
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.960]   sense, but for me personally, I've kind of come to peace with, with generally
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.320]   not buying it because I'm already protected in a lot of ways.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.520]   And one thing you mentioned that's actually become a bigger thing now
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.360]   that, now that airlines have changed the rules.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.960]   So Southwest has always been this great airline.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   You can book your flight and you can cancel at any time and you can get money
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.320]   back, or if you booked it with miles, you get your miles back and it's great.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.760]   And now a lot of airlines give you that flexibility too.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.520]   So, you know, one hack you mentioned is just, if you want to go on a trip, you
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.720]   could book it now and wait and see if a cheaper flair comes up.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.520]   Absolutely.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.480]   Absolutely.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.920]   You know, I mean, it's one of the best, one of the best changes in policy that
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.720]   the airlines made in the past year was to get rid, permanently get rid of those
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.600]   change fees and so that if, when you book a flight, you automatically get flexibility.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.400]   But one of the things to very much be aware of is that it only applies.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.000]   If you book in main economy or higher, it does not apply to basic economy.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.920]   You're still pretty well locked into your dates.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.400]   If you book a basic economy flight.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.280]   And so it's something to, you know, consider when you're seeing what the
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.240]   price difference is between main economy and basic economy, if it's five bucks,
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.680]   if it's 10 bucks, yeah, I'll always buy up to main economy.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.120]   If it's, you know, a hundred bucks, 200 bucks, then I'm sort of sitting there
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.280]   trying to get a kind of take stock and think how likely am I going to want
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.440]   to change the dates later?
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.920]   How, how much do I feel like locked into this trip with the
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.480]   dates that I already chosen?
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.400]   Yep.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.280]   And the, the, the add on hack that I'll share is let's say you're flying an
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.040]   airline that doesn't have that flexibility, or let's say you ended up
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.880]   buying that basic economy ticket and you decide you're not going on the trip.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.920]   I always tell people don't cancel it now, right?
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.160]   The difference between canceling it the day you don't want to go and the
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   day before you take off is zero.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:50.800]   And if any time up until the day you're departing, that flight is changed,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.640]   canceled, rescheduled, delayed.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.920]   You can call the airline and say, Hey, I noticed my schedule changed.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.520]   It's six hours later.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.880]   I don't want to do the flight anymore.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.760]   And you know, I've tried one time I tried and the flight changed three minutes and
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.960]   they were, there was no, no, no leeway, but if your flight changes by a few hours
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.760]   or if the schedule changes to a different airport or a different day,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.000]   you can get your money back.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.000]   So this is one of the hidden best things.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.560]   You know, when you get that email, it says, you know, Scott,
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.200]   your flight schedule has changed.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.640]   Most people's heart was saying, Oh God, what a pain.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.360]   You know, I view that not as a bad thing.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.040]   View that as an opportunity because not even not like, yes, certainly
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.320]   if you want your money back, yes.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.440]   View that as, Oh, this is great because again, under us law, you're eligible
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.760]   for a refund cash refund in full.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.320]   When, when that, when that happens, when there's a significant schedule change,
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.560]   but even if you don't want to refund, even if you still want to take the trip,
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.280]   you want your flights when they make those schedule changes, what this means
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   is that you can actually switch to a more convenient flight than you might
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.400]   have originally booked without having to pay any fair difference at all.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.920]   It doesn't matter if you're the new flight was, you know, it was more
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.760]   expensive on most airlines, they'll let you switch to, you know, let's say
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.600]   your original flight was a connecting flight, but now with the schedule
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.960]   change, you'll actually generally be able to switch to a nonstop flight
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.640]   or to a better, you know, to flights with better times, even flights with
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.720]   better dates than you'd originally booked.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.160]   So viewing this as an opportunity to get a much better flight
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.360]   than you originally booked.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.440]   My example was, and this was a miles trip.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.080]   We booked miles to the Seychelles for our honeymoon.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.520]   And I got an email that Air France doesn't, is no longer flying to the
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.080]   Seychelles.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.800]   And I told my wife and she was like, what are we going to do?
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.400]   I was like, this is good.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.640]   So he called the airline and we had booked it in business class and the
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:48.520]   airline rebooked us in Emirates first class, which please tell me this
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.040]   wasn't the shower in the sky.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:50.480]   Was it?
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.040]   So it wasn't the shower, but it was the private suite.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.880]   So like you had a door, which, which actually on our honeymoon, I was
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.240]   like, well, I'll see you later.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.720]   Like you have your room on the plane.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.920]   I have my room on the plane, but you know, it was to many people, the idea
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.200]   of your flight getting canceled or rescheduled is terrible for us.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.840]   We basically upgraded from a ticket that, I mean, Emirates first class
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.320]   would have been probably $10,000.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.520]   Can I ask you this?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.360]   So generally speaking, I've only flown in like business or first class
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.080]   internationally a couple of times.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.560]   So I'm like enough to be aware of how swanky it can be, you know, the
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.960]   fly flat seats, the champagne, the whole works, but not enough that it's
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.640]   become like an expectation has it.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.360]   And the reason why I haven't done it in a lot of ways, you know, cause I love
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.280]   playing the points and miles game, but the reason why I'm almost hesitant to
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:44.640]   do it is I'm, I'm worried that it's going to become a sort of lifestyle
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.080]   inflation or lifestyle creep where all of a sudden flying in coach to, you
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:53.840]   know, Paris or, or, or wherever it's going to feel really arduous and, and
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.920]   one, has that been the case for you or does it still feel wherever, however
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.120]   you're flying, it's totally fine.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:05.600]   No, no, I, it's gotten to be, I played the miles and points game so hard that
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.960]   it became so easy to fly in business.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   And, you know, it was much easier when I had a job where I was running a
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.120]   company and I had a lot of expenses that I put on a credit card, or I worked
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.640]   for a job where I traveled a lot.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.480]   I do neither of those things now.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:23.760]   So while I have a lot of points today, I don't accumulate a lot more points.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   So I'm dreading the time in the future where I've, I've exhausted my points
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.560]   and I'm, I'm, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.600]   Like I've gotten too accustomed that I, you know, I, unless it's a short
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.680]   direct flight, you know, I, I try to use points to upgrade.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.600]   I've never paid for it.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.560]   Bought a business class ticket.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.480]   They were like really expensive.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.080]   I mean, you know, with the occasional, the occasional exception, like I'm not
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:56.120]   sure folks necessarily realize how expensive transoceanic business class
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.400]   flights are, I mean, we're talking not like three or four times, not like
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.920]   double the price, like five, six, seven times the price of an economy ticket.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.640]   Oftentimes.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.120]   Japan could be $600 in coach and $8,000 in business.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.840]   Easily.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.600]   And, and, and so part of that is like why I've kind of pumped the breaks on
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.840]   trying on like even considering business class, you know, maybe, I don't know,
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.080]   maybe, who knows, maybe ask Scott when he's like 50 years old and the like,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.280]   Oh yeah, I need a little more comfort in this guy.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.520]   But I've always been like a little, a little wary of like giving, letting
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.840]   myself drink from that milkshake too often because I'm like worried, like,
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.440]   Oh man, now the coach flying is going to be terrible.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.680]   I think that was, that's a wise move.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.280]   And, and I encourage everyone to follow.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.440]   You're just trying to keep all the award availability open for yourself
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.280]   on, on business class and all the others.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.920]   Well, I mentioned miles.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.640]   I know you don't talk a lot about miles in the book until the end.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.560]   And I thought it was, you know, we, we did a whole episode about credit
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.600]   card points and miles and the advice I thought was really salient, which was,
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.160]   you know, it went into a lot more detail, but at its fundamentals, it's, if you
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.280]   have flexibility and you want to, and you're okay, flying coach, like points,
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.600]   points and miles, like you might not need them to get a good deal.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.480]   If you want to fly business, there's really, I mean, you're
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.680]   going to be waiting for years.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.600]   If your requirement is I want to go to Japan and business class, and I want
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.120]   to spend less than a thousand dollars.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.600]   I don't know if it will ever happen.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.800]   But so, so I, I loved the takeaway, which was if you want to fly business
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.160]   class and you want to get a really good deal, miles might give you that leverage
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.520]   because the way I kind of describe it is mile or in the dollars game, a business
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.080]   class ticket might be five or 10 times expensive.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.480]   And in the miles game, it's like two times as expensive.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.280]   So you get a deal.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.360]   But when you're trying to find a cheap domestic or a cheap domestic flight, or
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.760]   you're flying in coach to from New York to London, Gosh, just the taxes on some
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.880]   of these miles tickets are more than the coach ticket.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   I'm so, you know, and, and, and not only that, but I think this is one
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.080]   of those incidental by-products of now living in the golden age of cheap
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.760]   flights since 2015 or so it's like when I started out in the miles game a decade
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:14.160]   ago, you just didn't see very many cheap long haul, you know, intercontinental
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.360]   flights, the way you do now that they're being so regular.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.280]   And so miles, you know, even me, I was flying mostly economy, entirely
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.720]   economy to, you know, Asia, Europe, South America, but miles were still,
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.960]   were a great value because the tickets, the cash tickets might've still cost,
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.960]   you know, 800, 900 bucks to fly to Europe.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:40.080]   And so if I could spend just like 50 or 60,000 miles to fly in economy, I felt
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.120]   like, yeah, I'm getting pretty good value here, but now, you know, if that
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.280]   same 60,000 mile ticket, you can get for 300 bucks roundtrip, well, then
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.760]   it's a horrible value on miles.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.000]   And to your point where the real, I think it's value, I think in the
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.160]   points and miles game is, is in more of the premium seats.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.440]   And I think this is why you see a lot of the airlines starting to move
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.840]   towards devaluation, trying to make the business class and, and, and premium
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.920]   products, more higher redemption rates, because they're recognizing that, you
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.760]   know, this might've been a little bit too generous to be sustainable.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.120]   Now there's still a lot of sweet spots around.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.040]   There's still certainly great ways to get, to get value, but it's, it's been
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.760]   interesting to me to watch miles go from something where I started my career a
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.680]   decade ago as being like, especially lucrative for, for however you are
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.720]   flying to now them being frankly pretty marginal when you're flying economy.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.120]   And, and, and I think being much more of a value if you're flying in premium.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.160]   And you know, you might, I try to tell people, yeah, you might get a better
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.800]   deal on business class using miles, but you're always going to get
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.440]   more flights if you fly in coach.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.040]   So yes, you could hack your way to get to a cheaper business class ticket to
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.560]   Europe, but you could also just take two trips in coach.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.080]   And so don't forget that the trade-off is even if it's a good deal in business,
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.440]   that doesn't mean that it doesn't cost two or three times as many miles or
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.160]   dollars as, as it would to take more trips.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.640]   And one of the things you said in the, in the book was people are
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.080]   happier who take more trips.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.320]   Absolutely.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.240]   And, and, and, you know, where like oftentimes those preferences
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.040]   recognizing that that can vary a lot with your age, with your, what
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:23.960]   type of trip you're taking.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.480]   You know, when I was in my twenties, I would, I would go to the ends of the
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.000]   earth to save a couple bucks because I was time rich and I was cash poor, but
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.600]   now, you know, into my thirties, getting a little bit older, I feel like, you
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.720]   know, I'm much more willing to spend a little bit extra to get a nonstop flight
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.560]   to spend a little bit extra, to have a more comfortable itinerary than, and,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.600]   and be able to like get home quicker and spend some time with my young daughter.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.760]   Whereas, you know, when I, I think back to this, sometimes this flight
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.480]   I took in my twenties to, to save a few bucks, I think I saved $30 on a
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.240]   flight from Washington DC to Denver.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.600]   I took the scenic route.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.760]   I flew Washington DC to New York, to Boston, to Chicago, to LA, out
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.200]   to Denver, just to save 30 bucks.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.760]   Now, the idea of doing that, you got the story.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.240]   Exactly.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.480]   I got a great story out of it.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.640]   It was, it was certainly a fun travel day.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.040]   Now the idea of doing that today sounds horrendous because I have a lot more
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.280]   things I'd rather be doing with my time and, and, but, you know, back then it
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.720]   was really important to me to save as much money as possible and recognizing
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.480]   that, you know, look, different people are in different situations in their lives.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.560]   For a lot of folks, cheap flights aren't necessarily a vanity.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.920]   It might be the difference between being able to take a trip or not going at all.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.680]   You know, if I, if, if, when that $130 round trip flight to Milan popped up
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.880]   at that, that it wasn't as though I was deciding between that or an $850 flight.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.080]   If it was $850, I wasn't going to go.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.880]   But for 130 bucks, absolutely.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.080]   I was going to take that trip.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.880]   And that's why prioritizing cheap flights and making them really the centerpiece of
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.560]   your travel means that you're able to take three or four vacations for the same
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.080]   price you used to be able to pay for one.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.880]   And you wind up taking more vacations than you would have otherwise.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.800]   I think I, if there's something that I've evolved from, it's, it's, I'm
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.760]   like optimizing for my own happiness.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.160]   So a cheaper flight means more vacations.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.720]   I think I mentioned to you last time we talked, there's this book called happy
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.200]   money and, and they always say, you know, pay, pay in advance for things and you
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.320]   can savor it the entire time before you leave, you know, when you're there, you
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.720]   don't have this bill at the end.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.680]   And so, you know, that doesn't mean prepay for the hotel three months out, but
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.960]   maybe like a week before you leave or, or right when you get to check in, just be
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.120]   like, Hey, can we just pay for this hotel right now?
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.080]   So that when I check out, there's not a big bill.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.520]   One of the most fascinating things for me in delving into the research around
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.520]   travel and happiness for this book was running into research about the way that
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.280]   we tend to enjoy our vacations, where we think, you know, historically think of
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.480]   vacation is just something you enjoy while you're on the trip itself.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.840]   But turns out.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.960]   That if you look at the, the, the, the studies that have been done on this, the
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:07.640]   research, we actually enjoy the anticipation of a trip more than we do the trip itself.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.760]   We say we're happier when we're looking forward to a trip and we're daydreaming
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.760]   about those, you know, those cocktails on the beach and hanging out that cafe in
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.080]   Paris and going bungee jumping in New Zealand, then we enjoy, you know,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.160]   anticipating that and that excitement about what's coming for it.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.400]   Then we actually are on the trip itself and we enjoy the memories of doing those
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.680]   things after the fact more than we do the trip itself.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.480]   And so, you know, we certainly enjoy ourselves when we're on travel, but
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   recognizing just how powerful anticipation and memories are.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.560]   And so trying to, rather than booking a last minute flight and robbing
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.680]   yourself of that anticipatory joy, book yourself a flight months in advance
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.200]   and give your today self months to look forward to this flight, to be able to,
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.160]   you know, travel plan and daydream and just be excited about something that's coming up.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.920]   Here'd be a great hack I just thought of is just book your flight three, four
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.280]   months out, and then sometime in the next three, four months, book the next flight.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.360]   So that even though you might only take two or three trips a year, if you could
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.680]   live in a world where you always have a next trip plan, you can live in that
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.320]   anticipatory period, which, you know, we know is, is happier.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.760]   This is one of the ways that I think that cheap flights are at their most
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   powerful is that when you're taking, it's not just the money that you save, but the
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.280]   way that when you take three or four trips a year, rather than one trip a year,
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.160]   because you've got a cheap flight rather than overpaying, what happens is that
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.480]   normal travel cycle, you know, when, if you're taking one trip a year, that trip
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.560]   is great, but then when you get back home, I mean, gosh, you remember that
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.240]   feeling of just a hangover of just like, oh, back to real life.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.680]   Uh, got to get back to work.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.240]   This, we both have small, we both have small daughters.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.680]   I think when you get home from a flight with kids, I think it's just, you
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.120]   know, you almost need an extra day.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:58.560]   Exactly.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.360]   But the, the, when you have, when you're prioritizing cheap flights and you're
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.640]   taking three or four trips a year, rather than one, you don't have that same sort
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.200]   of sense, like I'm get home and my vacation's done and it's going to be 11
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.200]   months until I travel again, you have that sense, oh, I'm back home.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.480]   I get to readjust to life and it's only three months until my next trip.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.880]   It's only four months till my next trip.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.600]   And I'm already back in the cycle where I've gotten, you know, if I haven't
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.000]   already booked that next flight, I'm about to, I'm seeing what great deals pop
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.360]   up and I'm giving, I'm getting back on this sort of hamster wheel of getting
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.640]   excited, anticipatory joy, travel planning, and all that.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.400]   So it, it, it turns it from a sort of dreaded hangover cycle to one where
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.520]   you're just constantly excited about what's coming up around the corner.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.760]   And, and so obviously there's joy in the anticipation.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.640]   You talked a little bit in this, in the book about the, the peak end rule,
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.320]   which is, you know, how to maximize your joy on the trip.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.880]   Talk, can you talk a little bit about that?
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.400]   So this, this policy, this is this concept in, in psychology that the way
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.120]   we tend, you know, we talked about how memories of trip tend to, we, we tend
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.240]   to enjoy those even more than the trip itself in part because memories are
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.680]   forever memory, you know, you get to that, that, that, that trip that you
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.800]   took from Zambia to Tanzania, you know, you're only on that train for what, a
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.080]   couple of days, but you know, you've gotten to, to relive that after the fact
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:29.560]   for, for years, the way that we tend to remember our vacations are, are, are
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.680]   two things about them.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.840]   One, we tend to remember them how we felt at it's like peak emotional state.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.800]   So, you know, like you, you went bungee jumping in New Zealand, you went
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.760]   running with the bulls in Pamplona, you know, you ate some just incredible sushi
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.200]   in Japan, you tend to remember the peak and you tend to remember what you did
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.040]   at the end of the trip, how you, how it kind of wrapped up.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.280]   And so one of the, I think with that in mind, knowing that human psychology, we
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.120]   tend to remember the peak and the end.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.200]   Give yourself something really fun and, and, and really exciting to look forward
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.120]   to on that last day, because if you can end the trip on a high note, you know,
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.920]   you have a wonderful meal plan.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.600]   You've got a great tour planned so far, whatever it is for that last day, that'll
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.520]   make your trip, that'll give your future self so many more happy memories to
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.720]   remember about that trip than if you ended the trip on just something, you
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.320]   know, kind of lackadaisical or just something, meh, give your schedule
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.720]   something really fun and exciting to look forward to at the, as the last day.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.480]   And that'll give you a kind of your, your, your, your, your, your future self
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.960]   that much more to be happy about and it's memories.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.600]   I talked to my wife last night.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.440]   I told her this, cause I was like, we got to make sure on our next trip,
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.040]   we planned something for the last day.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.240]   And I said, do you remember when we went on our honeymoon?
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.800]   We went to the Seychelles in Paris.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.520]   And in Paris, we went to a couple of nice, like Michelin star restaurants.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.560]   And they were not on the last day.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.240]   They were on a random middle day.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.920]   And I was like, do you remember those meals?
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.560]   And what she remembered was she was like, well, I remember at one of them, you
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.240]   didn't have a sport coat and you had to borrow a sport coat.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.560]   And I remember the other one, the chair was really old and you got a splinter
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.320]   and they treated you as if the splinter was like a broken arm, they brought out
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.600]   gloves and, and I was like, yeah, but do you even remember the meal?
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.880]   Cause the meal was expensive.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.160]   Neither one of us could remember anything about the meal except being full.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.040]   And I was like, gosh, if we had had that meal on our last day, we
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.320]   would have remembered it for years.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.280]   And so I think that was so great.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.280]   And on my next trip, I am planning, you know, something epic for the last.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.480]   Yeah, that they, the psychologist who, who, or I think he's behavioral
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.520]   economists who termed this idea of peak end rule, he even shared a memory
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.560]   about how, when he was traveling with his wife in Switzerland, they, they,
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.800]   they were scheduled to have one more day, but they had this just really wonderful
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.320]   day, you know, great picnic hiking through the Alps, they just had such a
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.640]   good time that they had the option of adding on another day, but they decided
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.680]   to actually, let's cut our vacation a day short.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.800]   Like we wanted to end on this, on this high note, rather than kind of ending
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.880]   on a slump and again, robbing their future selves of that sort of joy
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.760]   of, of memories of the trip.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.000]   And so I'm not sure I would necessarily endorse like cutting short your vacation
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.560]   if you have a really great day, but at least trying to plan something really
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.720]   fun and nice to look forward to on that last day.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.880]   Any, any other travel hacks, tips, whether it's flights or, or any other
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.160]   aspect of travel that, that we didn't touch that people should know about?
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.920]   Oh boy, gosh, I could go on all day.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.880]   One of the, so there are a couple of things too, that I like to kind of bring
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:39.240]   up as let's go with like, kind of more bite-sized hacks here, the 24 hour rule.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.720]   This is a federal regulation that many folks aren't necessarily familiar with,
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.600]   but that can be really a power, like one of the most powerful arrows
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.520]   in your quiver as a, as a traveler.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.760]   What the 24 hour rule is, is that when you book a flight, as long as you booked
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.040]   it directly with the airline, as long as it's at least a week out from travel,
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.720]   you automatically, from the moment you hit purchase are given a 24 hour window
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.720]   when you can cancel that ticket and get a full refund, no questions asked, no
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.560]   penalties, no fees, no nothing.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.320]   And so what the 24 hour rule, where that it's just like, A, knowing that you have
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   that in case you book a flight and, and I don't know, you decide the next day,
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.680]   you thought better of it, don't want it, knowing that you can get a full refund,
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.800]   but B, the ways that it can really kind of put you in a prime position
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.200]   to scoop up a cheap flight.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.600]   So let's say that $202 Japan flight pops up again.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.840]   And you're, you know, oh my gosh, that's an amazing fare, really excited, but
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.400]   you're significant others at work and they're in meetings all day and you're
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.120]   not necessarily going to be able to get in touch with them to, you know, plan
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.560]   out to propose this idea to scope out some dates, what you can do with the 24
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.400]   hour rule in mind is just go ahead and book one, you know, a week or go ahead
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.280]   and book three different possibilities for trips.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.920]   Oh, you know, book one trip in March, one trip in April, one trip in May.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.160]   And then when you're knowing that this deal might not necessarily last very
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   long, it could be gone in a number of hours.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.880]   And so if you wait to book until they're out back from home, from work,
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.640]   it's probably going to be gone.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.280]   But if you would lock in the price now, what you've done is you've essentially
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.120]   just frozen that price for 24 hours.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.240]   And you can decide that night when your significant other gets home.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.280]   Hey, do you want to take that?
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.840]   Should we take this $202 flight to Japan?
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.280]   And if so, should we take this one that booked in March or should we take it in
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.480]   April or should we take it in May?
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.880]   Or should we take all three by, by, by locking in the price, you know, you get
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.000]   to keep whichever one you want and you can cancel the others for a, you know,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.400]   for free and get your money back.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.320]   And this isn't a refund or this isn't a flight credit, right?
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:43.760]   Exactly.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.480]   Credit, you know, refund on your credit card.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.720]   And, and, and, and it's not just, you know, a situation like that.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.080]   Let's say one of the cool things that the airlines do often is when they're
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.400]   cutting flights, cutting fares, they are oftentimes engaged in what's called a
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.320]   fare war.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.200]   So that happened with those flights to Japan where initially I think American
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.840]   airlines was offering like $500 flights from the U S to Japan anytime over the
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.560]   next year.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.320]   And then United responded with $400 flights and American responded to United
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.880]   with $350 flights and United responded to your $250 and they just kept ratcheting
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.320]   down and down until they got to 200 bucks round trip.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.800]   And so let's say you had initially booked that $500 flight.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:33.840]   Well, if the price drops down, as long as it's within 24 hours, you can just book
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.440]   that new flight at the lower price and cancel your old flight and get your full
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.000]   money back.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.160]   And so this is a way, again, knowing within the 24 hours is if the fare drops,
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.760]   if it's a, you know, direct flight rather than none, then connecting any type of
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.480]   better flight, you can take advantage of it within those 24 hours.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.560]   Tell me if this is possible.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.480]   Let's say I want to book this flight and I'm not sure it's not a special deal.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.880]   I'm just going on a trip.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.840]   I need to go, I book a flight 24 hours later, fare's the same.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.000]   Could I just every day, rebook the flight and cancel the other one and just keep
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.480]   going and basically have unlimited window to cancel until of course the fare goes up
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.240]   and then I stop?
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.840]   That is a really good question.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.640]   So the way that, here's the way that I would be thinking about that.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:27.960]   One, you're going to have to float the, as much as I wish they were, refunds are
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.440]   not instantaneous, you know, it's going to be sometimes the airlines, you know,
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.600]   it can be weeks until that actual refund shows up in your credit card.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.720]   So each day you do it, you might have to be adding another, you know, $200 onto
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.280]   your credit card bill.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.800]   And so recognizing that it might be a little bit until you get that refund.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.080]   The other thing too, is that the airlines do have language in their contract of
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:53.760]   carriage that sort of precludes what they would consider, you know, like essentially
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.120]   gaming the system, whether like, I, to me, this doesn't seem like game, this isn't,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.440]   this seems like doing, you know, do it like just putting yourself in a good
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.200]   position, but I could see the airline being like, ah, you know, this is Scott
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.320]   keeps doing this, booking flights, canceling them every single day.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.680]   He's not the type of customer we want.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.240]   Like airlines are allowed discretion to say like, you're not allowed to buy
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.360]   flights with us anymore.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.640]   So I could see it.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.400]   It just, I would like, I would like to see somebody kind of execute it in
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.800]   practice before I gave a ringing endorsement.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:33.640]   But at a bare minimum, anytime you book a flight 23 hours later, if that flight is
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.320]   cheaper, you should rebook your flight.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:35.920]   You should absolutely.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.120]   And, and, and, and to be clear, you should, the way to execute this is to re like
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.200]   book the new flight first and then cancel the old flight, because what you don't
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:50.400]   want to do is cancel your old flight and then book a new flight.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.320]   But by the time, you know, you've canceled the old one, book the new one.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.840]   I mean, remembering airfare changes sometimes by the hour, if not by the
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.400]   minute, and so if you, the worst case scenario is you've already canceled the
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.160]   good deal you got, you go to book the new one, but the price suddenly jumped and
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.960]   you're all of a sudden left with no flights.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.760]   Whereas, you know, if you book the new flight at the lower fare, you go to
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.040]   cancel the old one and just, you know, the worst case scenario is you just got
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.920]   outside of that 24 hour window.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.840]   But even in that situation, you can just cancel the second flight that you
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.040]   booked and be no worse for the wear.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.640]   So yeah, making sure you kind of go in the proper order of steps here.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.280]   I can't remember which airline, but there's at least one airline that if you
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.800]   book that second flight and you put in your frequent flyer number, they say,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.920]   nah, you already have a flight, a seat on that flight.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.200]   But the hack is just book the second flight with no frequent flyer number,
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.880]   cancel the first flight, go back and add your number to the second flight.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.000]   I like that a lot because you can always add in your frequent flyer number later.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.240]   You can always add in your TSA pre-check number later.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.960]   You don't have to do it right when you book.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.800]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.600]   I feel like we have a ton of hacks.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.720]   The other hack that I read in the book that I loved was if you're going to look
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.240]   for a flight for a family, right, you had three or four people, sometimes you
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.480]   search for a flight for four and you realize, wow, when I was just looking for
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.800]   one, it was cheaper.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.600]   You know, there are times where it can be helpful to have your itinerary all
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:17.440]   booked together, but sometimes there might be three seats at a cheap price and
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.120]   the fourth seat is really expensive.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.720]   And when you try to book all four, you're going to pay the four, the
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.320]   expensive price four times.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.200]   So definitely play around with searching for one passenger and then four, and it
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.520]   could be cheaper to book two or three people at one fare instead.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.840]   That's exactly right.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.880]   You know, I did that on a recent flight from Portland to New York, where I was
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.440]   traveling buying three tickets.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.640]   When I searched for one ticket, actually when I searched for two tickets, it was
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.240]   $117, but when I searched for three tickets, it was $177.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:51.960]   And so by buying two tickets at the $117 price and then buying the third ticket at
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:57.200]   $177, I was able to save $120 off of what I would have otherwise paid.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.480]   Now, the reason why is again, like you said, airlines want to, when you book
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.080]   multiple tickets on a single itinerary, they want to put it all in the same fare
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.240]   bucket, so if they, in my case, they only had two tickets left at that $117 price.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.240]   So if I wanted to buy three, they had to all be at the $177 price.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.320]   But what does it matter?
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.200]   You know, you're still in the same seats.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.840]   Like we talked about earlier, you ask the person sitting next to you what they
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.800]   paid, probably a very different fare.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.160]   This is a good example of why that can be the case.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.320]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.520]   Scott, I feel like we covered a lot.
