[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.320]   Just about a five-minute update for you, four quick points, and a couple of closing remarks
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   to hopefully encourage you.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.800]   I want you to know that I'm here and I am working with you through this time.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.560]   I know it's been a very difficult time.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   We've gotten note after note and email after email of many of you just facing new changes
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.360]   as we all are.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.640]   Many people laid off, losing their jobs, businesses being impacted.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.720]   I just want you to know I care about it.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.840]   I care about you.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560]   It's been a very tiring last few days, very wearing.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.120]   I'm one of those emotional people that kind of emotes with, it sounds like a stupid word,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.080]   emotes with people, but I feel your pain and I'm working with you.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   I've been mostly busy the last few days just working with a lot of consulting clients,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080]   trying to work through some problems.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.040]   We've done everything from people doing well, how to capitalize on this, to people heading
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.840]   into bankruptcy and how do we protect against that.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760]   It's been quite the interesting experience and I'm so grateful to do that because one
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.920]   of the things I've realized, I've done a lot of consulting this year ever since I got my
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.600]   life stationary and it's really helped me a ton to just have better insight into what
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   works and what doesn't.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'll be bringing some of those lessons to you as soon as I can.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.540]   If you are in need of personal consultation, that's where most of my time is going this
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.880]   week and next week, email me joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.440]   I'd be happy to work with you.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   I'm currently running a March Madness sale that's still on until the end of March.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.240]   March Madness, so I'm discounting my consulting fees from $400 an hour to $250 an hour.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.280]   I have yet to have an unsatisfied client even though we've had clients from every different
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   stage of finances.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.960]   If you'd like to talk about your specific situation, send me an email joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.560]   I've also been updating courses this week.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.320]   I had a couple of several update calls with some of my courses for my students of how
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.880]   to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   We had a live update on Monday where we talked in detail about, I shared what I'm doing to
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.720]   protect my money from additionally, you know, crises that are getting additionally more
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.960]   and more dangerous.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.640]   We talked about what's working, what's not, answered a lot of questions about this current
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   crisis.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   If you'd like access to that, then of course go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.520]   join that course.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.280]   20% off coupon code for all of my courses right now using coupon code coronavirus.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.400]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and enter coronavirus if you'd like to try
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   that course out.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.680]   Also, I'm going to be finishing up this next week my course on radical preparedness.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.360]   I got behind because the world started falling apart, but if you'd like that, it's not in
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.240]   the store right now because it's kind of a beta version, super cheap but a beta version.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.040]   Go to radicalpreparedness.com and you can sign up there for that one.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.160]   That one's very practical, kind of the nuts and bolts of practical family preparedness.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.280]   If you are having financial trouble right now, businesses struggling, etc., I want you
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.200]   to count your blessings because frankly this is the best time to go broke.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.320]   Sounds terrible, I know, but it's true that it's really frustrating and difficult to go
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.040]   broke when it's just you, but you know, when it's just you.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.360]   You don't get a lot of mercy from the mortgage company when you can't pay your mortgage if
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.260]   you're the only one that can't pay your mortgage.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.920]   You don't get a lot of leniency from your landlord about paying your rent when it's
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.160]   just you who's going broke at one time.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.460]   You're out on the street pretty quickly.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.240]   Best time to go broke is probably when everyone else is going broke as well.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.100]   So if you can't pay your mortgage payment, you can't pay your rent payment, then be thankful
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.120]   that everyone else is in the same picture right now and fight.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.640]   I don't have the time right now to finish the show, but I think the next show I'll be
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.920]   doing is going to be basically how to fight in the middle of this.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.260]   So if you lost your job, stay tuned, keep an eye on your podcast feed and I'll release
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.820]   that episode soon.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.840]   How to cut your finances quickly, how to be thoughtful, how to prioritize, how to deal
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.720]   with the emotion of it and just do kind of a cold logical analysis and how to do it.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.620]   But at this point in time, everybody's in the same boat.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.280]   Not everybody, many people are in the same boat with you.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.300]   I have been encouraged though.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.420]   Not everybody's going broke and that's really great because one of the things that you see
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.200]   right now is you see how good preparations really make the difference.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.480]   Good financial preparations really make the difference.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.280]   Having been prudent, those who've been prudent and have been careful are in good shape.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.040]   And those who've thought carefully about their lifestyle and been prudent in advance are
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.120]   in good shape.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.240]   And so at this point, still working to figure out the opportunities in investment markets,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.320]   watching things carefully, not going to make any public comment here other than simply
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   this.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   Stick to your plan.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.360]   Consider what your goals are.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.720]   Always start with goals.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.120]   Investments should simply fund goals.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.420]   That's it.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.040]   Investments should fund goals.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.120]   So start with goals.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.520]   Once your goals are clear, the path to an investment plan is also going to be clear.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.200]   So start with your goals.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.300]   Then consider the various paths that you can use to achieve those goals.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.940]   And consider the various investment outcomes, the various investment paths.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.080]   But start with your goals.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.920]   From there, make an investment plan and then implement it steadily.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.160]   This time of turmoil that we're in is going to be the foundation of many, many fortunes.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   Now some of those fortunes are going to be based on people who had money on the side,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.000]   who had capital to just simply put in.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.480]   I've been waiting years for this recession and so I'm not excited about it because it
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.200]   comes with a huge amount of pain for people, which I don't like.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.120]   But I am excited about it with the investment markets.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.880]   And so if you've been sitting with cash on the side or you've got cash on the side, this
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.360]   is and is going to be a golden time.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.480]   A lot of the timing of this depends on your goals and what exactly you're trying to do
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.340]   so that you can time it as best as you're able to.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.880]   On the other hand, if you don't have a lot of money, this can still be an opportunity
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.140]   because often times like this completely change the marketplace.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.760]   They completely show who is exposed and they create opportunities for those who are hustlers,
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.160]   those who are able to get in and be strategic and think, which is why you need to move so
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.320]   quickly.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.260]   So these are times of certainly great loss, but when there's change in the marketplace
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.920]   that creates opportunity and I want you to be able to take advantage of that opportunity.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.320]   Finally I've just been reflecting on truly how great life is and I do that a lot, especially
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.760]   during difficult times.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.400]   Just try to count my blessings sounds trite, but it's really true.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.160]   And a lot of reasons for that and I had some sick children the last few days as well and
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.960]   not coronavirus, just kind of standard sickness and some sick children, sick dogs for some
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.800]   reason.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.820]   Watching at work quarantine in case it is something else, but I don't think it is.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.720]   But just you reflect on it and with so much death around, you just reflect on how grateful
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.860]   you are to be alive and to be able to talk to those you love.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.720]   Right now in Spain, they're piling bodies in ice rinks.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.080]   I think the USA is probably a week behind Spain.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.240]   This coming next few days are going to be huge in the bad way, massive.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.040]   I continue to hope for the development of new therapies.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.480]   The hydroxychloroquine stuff mixed with the Z-Pak, that stuff looks increasingly promising,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.240]   but still no clear definitive answer right now.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   But pick up the phone and call someone you love and talk with them.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.400]   Again, right now in Spain, they don't have any place to put the bodies.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.000]   They're piling them in ice rinks.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.160]   And as this thing continues, we're back on doing mass graves.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.040]   And it's certainly devastating to the loss of life.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.200]   So it just feels sometimes I sit down and I think, "Okay, I'm going to record a show
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.680]   on money."
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.560]   Obviously money is important, but sometimes I just feel like I can't talk about money
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.120]   because in light of the weightier things, in light of eternity, in light of people's
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:46.280]   families and lives, it just kind of feels hollow to talk about money sometimes.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.560]   But to do with that, I want to close with a quote.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.040]   I was reading, I found this quote.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.800]   It was also in that book that I read the other day and I went and looked it up and then I
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.460]   got the book that it comes from.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.200]   But this quote that I'm about to read comes from a book written by Sterling Hayden.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   The book is called Wanderer.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.040]   It's kind of a classic evidently in the sailing community.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.120]   I haven't read the book yet.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.240]   I just found the quote and I went ahead and bought the book.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:19.480]   But evidently Sterling Hayden, I didn't know much about him, but he had quite the life.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.320]   And it's one of those stories of people going from the heights of society to taking a different
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.080]   – a very different scenario.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.720]   Sterling Hayden was a movie star and at some point in time he – I'll just read the
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   overview.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.080]   It says from this book on Amazon.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.000]   It says, "Sterling Hayden was at the peak of his earning power as a star when he suddenly
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   quit.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.560]   He walked out on Hollywood, walked out of a shattered marriage, defied the courts and
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.080]   broke and an outlaw set sail with his four children in the schooner Wanderer bound for
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   the South Seas."
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.280]   And it just kind of shares his overall story.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.640]   And so there's this quote that I found and I just thought it was interesting because
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:15.080]   it expresses a truth that sometimes people who live very broken lives can often express
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.920]   truths that some of us are simply too scared to acknowledge.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.800]   You think about the – what's his name?
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.840]   The dude that went and lived in the bus up in Alaska and died up there, the blue bus
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.020]   guy, I can't remember the name.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.880]   But here was Sterling Hayden's quote.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.800]   It says, "To be truly challenging, a voyage like a life must rest on a firm foundation
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.120]   of financial unrest.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.520]   Otherwise you are doomed to a routine traverse, the kind known to yachtsmen who play with
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.480]   their boats at sea, cruising it is called.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.720]   Voyaging belongs to seamen and to the wanderers of the world who cannot or will not fit in.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.680]   If you are contemplating a voyage and you have the means, abandon the venture until
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.520]   your fortunes change.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.800]   Only then will you know what the sea is all about.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.720]   I've always wanted to sail to the South Seas but I can't afford it.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.400]   What these men can't afford is not to go.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.020]   They are enmeshed in the cancerous discipline of security and in the worship of security
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:21.400]   we fling our lives beneath the wheels of routine and before we know it our lives are gone.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.320]   What does a man need, really need?
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:31.500]   A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in and some form of working
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.000]   activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   That's all, in the material sense, and we know it, but we are brainwashed by our economic
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.600]   system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.360]   gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention for the sheer idiocy of the charade.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.560]   The years thunder by.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.200]   The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.680]   Before we know it, the tomb is sealed.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.200]   Where then lies the answer?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.720]   In choice, what shall it be?
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.480]   Bankruptcy of purse or bankruptcy of life?
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.960]   That's all I want to share with you today, but I'll be back soon with you soon to talk
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:27.000]   about bankruptcy and how to use tumultuous difficult times to move yourself onto a different
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.400]   path.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.960]   Take heart, don't despair.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.240]   I know this sounds trite, I'm aware of that, but I think it's true.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   One of the things I often encourage myself with when I'm in the middle of financial trouble
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   is simply this.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.800]   If money can solve my problems, my problems are really in the grand scheme of things not
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.360]   so significant.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.280]   There are problems that cannot be solved with money, and those problems are very significant,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   but money problems in the fullness of time can usually be solved.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.720]   We'll talk about some techniques and we'll talk about dealing with that as soon as I
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   can go.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.200]   Got to go work with some clients now.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:15.840]   If you'd like to work with me privately, it's a big focus of mine right now, email me joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.900]   Use coupon code "MARCHMADNESS" in that email and I'll get you all the details on how to
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.900]   work with me.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.

[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.280]   We'll be finishing that off this week.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.160]   Do more together this holiday in a new Chevy.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.920]   Take on more adventure in the strong and capable Chevy Silverado.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.000]   More confidence in the Chevy Equinox.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.520]   Winner of the JD Power Award for initial quality among compact SUVs, two years running.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   And more value in the all new Chevy Trax with an available 11-inch diagonal touchscreen.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.120]   Bring the holidays together in a new Chevy.
