[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.040]   Never before had Rodin, the spear maker of old Babylon,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.180]   carried so much gold in his leather wallet.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.680]   Happily down the king's highway
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.740]   from the palace of his most liberal majesty, he strode.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.120]   Cheerfully, the gold clinked
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.720]   as the wallet at his belt swayed with each step,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   the sweetest music he had ever heard.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.220]   Fifty pieces of gold, all his.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.360]   He could hardly realize his good fortune.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.460]   What power in those clinking discs.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.440]   They could purchase anything he wanted.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.040]   A grand house, land, cattle, camels, horses, chariots,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.100]   whatever he might desire.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.240]   What use should he make of it?
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.380]   This evening, as he turned into a side street
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.920]   towards the home of his sister,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.680]   he could think of nothing he would rather possess
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.860]   than those same glittering, heavy pieces of gold.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.480]   His to keep.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.120]   It was upon an evening, some days later,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   that a perplexed Rodin entered the shop of Mathon,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.900]   the lender of gold and dealer in jewels and rare fabrics.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.740]   Glancing neither to the right nor the left
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.140]   at the colorful articles artfully displayed,
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.000]   he passed through to the living quarters at the rear.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   Here he found the genteel Mathon lounging upon a rug,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.180]   partaking of a meal served by a black slave.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.520]   "I would counsel with thee, for I know not what to do."
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.720]   Rodin stood stolidly, feet apart,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.120]   hairy breast exposed by the gaping front
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   of his leather jacket.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.120]   Mathon's narrow, sallow face smiled a friendly greeting.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.000]   "What indiscretions hast thou done
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.500]   that thou should seek the lender of gold?
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040]   Hast been unlucky at the gaming table?
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   Or hath some plump dame entangled thee?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.600]   For many years have I known thee,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.640]   yet never hast thou sought me."
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.320]   "Hast thou sought me to aid thee in thy troubles?"
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.440]   "No, no, not such as that.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.480]   I seek no gold.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.620]   Instead, I crave thy wise advice."
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.180]   "Hear, hear what this man doth say.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.220]   No one comes to the lender of gold for advice.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.920]   My ears must play me false."
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.760]   They listened true.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.660]   "Can this be so?
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.360]   Rodin, the spear-maker, doth display more cunning
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.940]   than all the rest, for he comes to Mathon
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.900]   not for gold, but for advice.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.960]   Many men come to me for gold to pay for their follies,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.780]   but as for advice, they want it not.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.460]   Yet who is more able to advise than the lender of gold
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.780]   to whom many men come in trouble?
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.460]   Thou shalt eat with me, Rodin," he continued.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.260]   "Thou shalt be my guest for the evening.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.820]   Ando," he commanded of the black slave,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.000]   "draw up a rug for my friend Rodin, the spear-maker,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.620]   who comes for advice.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.900]   He shall be mine honored guest.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.380]   Bring to him much food and get for him my largest cup.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.820]   Choose well of the best wine that he may have satisfaction
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.500]   in the drinking.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.660]   Now tell me what troubles thee."
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.620]   "It is the king's gift."
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.220]   "The king's gift?
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.580]   The king did make thee a gift, and it gives thee trouble.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.980]   What manner of gift?"
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.020]   "Because he was much pleased with the design
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.980]   I did submit to him for a new point
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.940]   on the spears of the royal guard.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.300]   He did present me with 50 pieces of gold,
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.420]   and now I am much perplexed.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.100]   I am beseeched each hour the sun doth travel across the sky
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.900]   by those who would share it with me."
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.340]   "That is natural.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.780]   More men want gold than have it, and would
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.980]   wish one who comes by it easily to divide.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.860]   But can you not say no?
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.660]   Is thy will not as strong as thy fist?"
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.500]   "To many I can say no, yet sometimes it
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.300]   would be easier to say yes.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.660]   Can one refuse to share with one's sister
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.020]   to whom he is deeply devoted?"
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.860]   "Surely thy own sister would not wish to deprive thee
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.260]   of enjoying thy reward."
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.340]   "But it is for the sake of Aramon, her husband, whom
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.620]   she wishes to see a rich merchant.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.260]   She does feel that he has never had a chance,
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.900]   and she beseeches me to loan to him this gold that he
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.700]   may become a prosperous merchant and repay me from his profits."
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.660]   "My friend," resumed Mathon, "to the worthy subject
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.500]   thou bringest to discuss, gold bringeth unto its possessor
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.980]   responsibility and a changed position with his fellow men.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.340]   It bringeth fear lest he lose it or it be tricked away from him.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.820]   It bringeth a feeling of power and ability to do good.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.700]   Likewise, it bringeth opportunities
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.940]   whereby his very good intentions may bring him into difficulties.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.180]   Didst ever hear of the farmer of Nineveh
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.380]   who could understand the language of animals?
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.100]   I wot not, for it is not the kind of tale
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.260]   men like to tell over the bronze caster's forge.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.060]   I will tell it to thee, for thou shouldst
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.860]   know that to borrowing and lending
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.740]   there is more than the passing of gold from the hands of one
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.860]   to the hands of another.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.820]   This farmer, who could understand
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.620]   what the animals said to each other,
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.900]   did linger in the farmyard each evening
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.980]   just to listen to their words.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.900]   One evening he did hear the ox bemoaning to the ass
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.980]   the hardness of his lot.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.620]   I do labor pulling the plow from morning until night.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.500]   No matter how hot the day or how tired my legs
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.260]   or how the bow doth chafe my neck, still must I work.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.860]   But you are a creature of leisure.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.140]   You are trapped with a colorful blanket
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.500]   and do nothing more than carry our master
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.780]   about where he wishes to go.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.540]   When he goes nowhere, you do rest and eat
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.780]   the green grass all the day.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.780]   Now the ass, in spite of his vicious heels,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.100]   was a goodly fellow and sympathized with the ox.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.500]   My good friend, he replied, you do work very hard
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.460]   and I would help ease your lot.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.420]   Therefore will I tell you how you may have a day of rest.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.060]   In the morning, when the slave comes to fetch you to the plow,
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.300]   lie upon the ground and bellow much
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.500]   that he may say you are sick and cannot work.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.100]   So the ox took the advice of the ass.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.540]   And the next morning, the slave returned to the farmer
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.620]   and told him the ox was sick and could not pull the plow.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.260]   Then, said the farmer, hitch the ass to the plow,
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.540]   for the plowing must go on.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.380]   All that day, the ass, who had only intended to help his friend,
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.140]   found himself compelled to do the ox's task.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.140]   When night came and he was released from the plow,
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.500]   his heart was bitter and his legs were weary
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.180]   and his neck was sore where the bow had chafed it.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.300]   The farmer lingered in the barnyard to listen.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.780]   The ox began first.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.500]   You are my good friend.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.420]   Because of your wise advice, I've enjoyed a day of rest.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.140]   And I, retorted the ass, am like many another simple-hearted one
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.900]   who starts to help a friend and ends up by doing his task for him.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.380]   Hereafter, you draw your own plow,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.980]   for I did hear the master tell the slave to send
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.180]   for the butcher were you sick again.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.420]   I wish he would, for you are a lazy fellow.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.620]   Thereafter, they spoke to each other no more.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.380]   This ended their friendship.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.500]   Canst thou tell the moral to this tale, Rodin?
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.060]   'Tis a good tale, responded Rodin.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.180]   But I see not the moral.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.420]   I thought not that you would.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.420]   But it is there and simple too.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.820]   Just this.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.420]   If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:55.500]   that will not bring thy friend's burdens upon thyself.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.020]   I had not thought of that.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.580]   It is a wise moral.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.900]   I wish not to assume the burdens of my sister's husband.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.140]   But tell me, you lend to many.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.420]   Do not the borrowers repay?'
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.180]   Mathon smiled the smile of one whose soul is rich
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.580]   with much experience.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.980]   Could a loan be well made if the borrower cannot repay?
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.420]   Must not the lender be wise and judge carefully
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.140]   whether his gold can perform a useful purpose to the borrower
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.300]   and return to him once more?
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   Or whether it will be wasted by one unable to use it wisely
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.340]   and leave him without his treasure
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.540]   and leave the borrower with a debt he cannot repay?
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.580]   I will show to thee the tokens in my token chest
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.900]   and let them tell thee some of their stories.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.860]   Into the room he brought a chest as long as his arm,
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:54.260]   covered with red pigskin and ornamented with bronze designs.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.940]   He placed it upon the floor and squatted before it,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.780]   both hands upon the lid.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.220]   'From each person to whom I lend,
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.660]   I do exact a token for my token chest
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.580]   to remain there until the loan is repaid.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.860]   When they repay, I give back.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.420]   But if they never repay, it will always remind me
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.540]   of one who was not faithful to my confidence.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.780]   The safest loans, my token box tells me,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.540]   are to those whose possessions are of more value
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.500]   than the one they desire.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.220]   They own lands or jewels or camels
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.580]   or other things which could be sold to repay the loan.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.180]   Some of the tokens given to me
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.060]   are jewels of more value than the loan.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.180]   Others are promises that if the loan be not repaid as agreed,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.140]   they will deliver to me certain property settlement.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.780]   On loans like those, I am assured that my gold
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.180]   will be returned with the rental thereon,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.220]   for the loan is based on property.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.260]   In another class are those who have the capacity to earn.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.140]   They are such as you, who labor or serve and are paid.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.780]   They have income, and if they are honest
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.580]   and suffer no misfortune,
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.540]   I know that they also can repay the gold I loan them
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.460]   and the rental to which I am entitled.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.140]   Such loans are based on human effort.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.340]   Others are those who have neither property
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.380]   nor assured earning capacity.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.340]   Life is hard, and there will always be some
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.100]   who cannot adjust themselves to it.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.740]   Alas, for the loans I make them,
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.660]   even though they be no larger than a pence,
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.900]   my token box may censure me in the years to come,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.980]   unless they be guaranteed by good friends of the borrower
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.660]   who know him honorable."
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.900]   Mathon released the clasp and opened the lid.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.900]   Rodin leaned forward eagerly.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.020]   At the top of the chest,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.620]   a bronze neck piece lay upon a scarlet cloth.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.620]   Mathon picked up the piece and patted it affectionately.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.980]   "This shall always remain in my token chest,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.620]   because the owner has passed on into the great darkness.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.900]   I treasure it, his token, and I treasure his memory,
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.020]   for he was my good friend.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.140]   We traded together with much success
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.100]   until out of the east he brought a woman to wed,
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   beautiful, but not like our women, a dazzling creature.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.220]   He spent his gold lavishly to gratify her desires.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.820]   He came to me in distress when his gold was gone.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.380]   I counseled with him.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.100]   I told him I would help him
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.940]   to once more master his own affairs.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.860]   He swore by the sign of the great bull that he would,
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.900]   but it was not to be.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.940]   In a quarrel, she thrust a knife
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.020]   into the heart he dared her to pierce.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.820]   "And she?" questioned Rodin.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.660]   "Yes, of course, this was hers."
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.900]   He picked up the scarlet cloth.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.420]   In bitter remorse, she threw herself into the Euphrates.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.300]   "These two loans will never be repaid.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.220]   The chest tells you, Rodin,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.780]   that humans in the throes of great emotions
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.620]   are not safe risks for the gold lender.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.780]   Here, now this is different."
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.620]   He reached for a ring carved of oxbone.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.580]   "This belongs to a farmer.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.620]   I buy the rugs of his women.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.500]   The locusts came and they had not food.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.180]   I helped him, and when the new crop came, he repaid me.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.140]   Later, he came again and told of strange goats
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.660]   in a distant land as described by a traveler.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.340]   They had long hair, so fine and soft
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.820]   it would weave into rugs more beautiful
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.380]   than any ever seen in Babylon.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.700]   He wanted a herd, but he had no money.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.100]   So I did lend him gold to make the journey
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.940]   and bring back goats.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.180]   Now his herd is begun, and next year,
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.240]   I shall surprise the lords of Babylon
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.700]   with the most expensive rugs
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.380]   it has been their good fortune to buy.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.580]   Soon I must return his ring.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.740]   He doth insist on repaying promptly."
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.620]   "Some borrowers do that," queried Rodin.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.340]   "If they borrow for a purpose
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.420]   that bring money back to them, I find it so.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.980]   But if they borrow because of their indiscretions,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.700]   I warn thee to be cautious
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.660]   if thou wouldst ever have thy gold back in hand again."
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.540]   "Tell me about this," requested Rodin,
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.380]   picking up a heavy gold bracelet
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.160]   inset with jewels and rare designs.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.420]   "The women do appeal to my good friend," bantered Mathon.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.220]   "I am still much younger than you," retorted Rodin.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.900]   "I grant that.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.580]   But this time thou doth suspicion romance where it is not.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.860]   The owner of this is fat and wrinkled,
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.860]   and doth talk so much and say so little she drives me mad.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.140]   Once they had much money and were good customers,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.500]   but ill times came upon them.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.540]   She has a son of whom she would make a merchant.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.220]   So she came to me and borrowed gold
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.020]   that he might become a partner of a caravan owner
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.780]   who travels with his camels,
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.360]   bartering in one city what he buys in another.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.820]   This man proved a rascal,
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.160]   for he left the poor boy in a distant city
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.060]   without money and without friends,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.220]   pulling out early while the youth slept.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.380]   Perhaps when this youth has grown to manhood, he will repay.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.380]   Until then, I get no rental for the loan, only much talk.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.780]   But I do admit the jewels are worthy of the loan."
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.820]   Did this lady ask thy advice as to the wisdom of the loan?
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.740]   "Quite otherwise.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.380]   She had pictured to herself this son of hers
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.100]   as a wealthy and powerful man of Babylon.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.340]   To suggest the contrary was to infuriate her.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.340]   A fair rebuke I had.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.060]   I knew the risk for this inexperienced boy.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.400]   But as she offered security, I could not refuse her.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.140]   This," continued Mathon,
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.300]   waving a bit of pack rope tied into a knot,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.780]   "belongs to Nabatur, the camel trader.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.500]   When he would buy a herd larger than his funds,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.860]   he brings to me this knot,
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.180]   and I lend to him according to his needs.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.500]   He is a wise trader.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.860]   I have confidence in his good judgment
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.340]   and can lend him freely.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.420]   Many other merchants of Babylon have my confidence
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.780]   because of their honorable behavior.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.700]   Their tokens come and go frequently in my token box.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.220]   Good merchants are an asset to our city,
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.460]   and it profits me to aid them to keep trade moving
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.940]   that Babylon be prosperous."
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.900]   Mathon picked out a beetle carved in turquoise
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.780]   and tossed it contemptuously on the floor.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.340]   "A bug from Egypt.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.460]   The lad who owns this does not care
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.140]   whether I ever receive back my gold.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.180]   When I reproach him, he replies,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.220]   'How can I repay when ill fate pursues me?
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.340]   You have plenty more.'
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.860]   What can I do?
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.940]   The token is his father's,
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.220]   a worthy man of small means who did pledge his land
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.140]   and herd to back his son's enterprises.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.420]   The youth found success at first
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.500]   and then was overzealous to gain great wealth.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.980]   His knowledge was immature.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.020]   His enterprises collapsed.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.620]   Youth is ambitious.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.060]   Youth would take shortcuts to wealth
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.260]   and the desirable things for which it stands.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.740]   To secure wealth quickly, youth often borrows unwisely.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.460]   Youth, never having had experience,
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.740]   cannot realize that hopeless debt is like a deep pit
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.460]   into which one may descend quickly
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.500]   and where one may struggle vainly for many days.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.860]   It is a pit of sorrow and regrets
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.020]   where the brightness of the sun is overcast
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.860]   and night is made unhappy by restless sleeping.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.740]   Yet I do not discourage borrowing gold.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.620]   I encourage it.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.340]   I recommend it if it be for a wise purpose.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.820]   I myself made my first real success
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.660]   as a merchant with borrowed gold.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.420]   Yet what should the lender do in such a case?
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.380]   The youth is in despair and accomplishes nothing.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.220]   He is discouraged.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.860]   He makes no effort to repay.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.420]   My heart turns against depriving the father
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.340]   of his land and cattle.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.260]   "You tell me much that I am interested to hear,"
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.820]   ventured Rodin, "but I hear no answer to my question.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.220]   Should I lend my 50 pieces of gold to my sister's husband?
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.460]   They mean much to me.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.740]   Thy sister is a sterling woman whom I do much esteem.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.380]   Should her husband come to me
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.620]   and ask to borrow 50 pieces of gold,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.380]   I should ask him for what purpose he would use it.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.780]   If he answered that he desired to become a merchant
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.780]   like myself and deal in jewels and rich furnishings,
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.660]   I would say, 'What knowledge have you of the ways of trade?
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.900]   Do you know where you can buy at lowest cost?
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.260]   Do you know where you can sell at a fair price?'
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.020]   Could he say yes to these questions?"
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.740]   "No, he could not," Rodin admitted.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   "He has helped me much in making spears
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.860]   and he has helped some in the shops."
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.460]   Then would I say to him that his purpose was not wise.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.380]   Merchants must learn their trade.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.580]   His ambition, though worthy, is not practical
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.740]   and I would not lend him any gold.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.540]   But supposing he could say,
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.380]   "Yes, I have helped merchants much.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.940]   I know how to travel to Smyrna
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.100]   and to buy at low cost the rugs the housewives weave.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.740]   I also know many of the rich people of Babylon
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.020]   to whom I can sell these at a large profit."
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.580]   Then I would say,
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.100]   "Your purpose is wise and your ambition honorable.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.140]   I shall be glad to lend you the 50 pieces of gold
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.140]   if you can give me security that they will be returned."
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.980]   But he would say,
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.500]   "I have no security other than that I am an honored man
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.100]   and will pay you well for the loan."
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.900]   Then would I reply,
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.940]   "I treasure much each piece of gold.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.740]   Were the robbers to take it from you
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.380]   as you journeyed to Smyrna
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.860]   or take the rugs from you as you returned,
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.540]   then you would have no means of repaying me
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.460]   and my gold would be gone."
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.460]   Gold, you see, Rodin,
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.220]   is the merchandise of the lender of money.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.860]   It is easy to lend.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.700]   If it is lent unwisely,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.900]   then it is difficult to get back.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.500]   The wise lender wishes not the risk of the undertaking,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.740]   but the guarantee of safe repayment.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.140]   "'Tis well," he continued,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.740]   "to assist those that are in trouble.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.500]   'Tis well to help those upon whom fate
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.540]   has laid a heavy hand.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.540]   'Tis well to help those who are starting,
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.620]   that they may progress and become valuable citizens.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.540]   But help must be given wisely,
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.620]   lest, like the farmer's ass,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.300]   in our desire to help,
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.620]   we but take upon ourselves the burden
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.780]   that belongs to another.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.220]   Again, I wandered from thy question, Rodin,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.020]   but hear my answer.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.140]   Keep thy 50 pieces of gold.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.620]   What thy labor earns for thee
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.020]   and what is given thee for reward is thine own,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.780]   and no man can put an obligation upon thee
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:09.180]   to part with it unless it do be thy wish.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.700]   If thee wouldst lend it so that it may earn thee more gold,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.180]   then lend with caution,
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.780]   and in many places I like not idle gold,
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.180]   even less I like too much of risk.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.540]   How many years hast thou labored as a spear-maker?
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   Fully three.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.700]   How much, besides the king's gift, hast saved?
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.820]   Three gold pieces.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.700]   Each year that thou hast labored,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.300]   thou hast denied thyself good things
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.300]   to save from thine earnings one piece of gold?
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.340]   'Tis as you say.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.580]   Then mightest save in 50 years of labor
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.380]   50 pieces of gold by thy self-denial?
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.300]   A lifetime of labor it would be.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.940]   Thinkest thou thy sister would wish
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.660]   to jeopardize the savings of 50 years of labor
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.580]   over the bronze melting pot
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.860]   that her husband might experiment on being a merchant?
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.780]   Not if I spoke in your words.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.580]   Then go to her and say,
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.420]   "Three years have I labored each day except fast days,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.500]   from morning until night,
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.140]   and I have denied myself many things that my heart craved.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.780]   For each year of labor and self-denial,
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.140]   I have to show one piece of gold.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.740]   Thou art my favored sister,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.820]   and I wish that thy husband may engage in business
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.500]   in which he will prosper greatly.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.900]   If he will submit to me a plan
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.540]   that seems wise and possible to my friend Mathon,
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:50.060]   then will I gladly lend to him my savings of an entire year,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.500]   that he may have an opportunity to prove that he can succeed.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.380]   Do that, I say,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.260]   and if he has within him the soul to succeed,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.860]   he can prove it.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.380]   If he fails, he will not owe thee more
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.860]   than he can hope someday to repay.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.020]   I am a gold lender because I own more gold
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.500]   than I can use in my own trade.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.820]   I desire my surplus gold to labor for others
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.380]   and thereby earn more gold.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.340]   I do not wish to take risk of losing my gold,
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.180]   for I have labored much
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.380]   and denied myself much to secure it.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.180]   Therefore, I will no longer lend any of it
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.020]   where I am not confident that it is safe
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.620]   and will be returned to me.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.260]   Neither will I lend it where I am not convinced
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.580]   that its earnings will be promptly paid to me.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.700]   I have told to thee, Rodin,
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.580]   a few of the secrets of my token chest.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.060]   From them you may understand the weakness of men
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.020]   and their eagerness to borrow that
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.140]   which they have no certain means to repay.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.340]   From this, you can see how often their high hopes
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.420]   of the great earnings they could make,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.980]   if they but had gold, are but false hopes.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.900]   They have not the ability or training to fulfill.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.420]   Thou, Rodin, now have gold,
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.980]   which thou shouldst put to earning more gold for thee.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   Thou art about to become, even as I, a gold lender.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.580]   If thou dost safely preserve thy treasure,
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.540]   it will produce liberal earnings for thee
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.460]   and be a rich source of pleasure
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.220]   and profit during all thy days.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.020]   But if thou dost let it escape from thee,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.180]   it will be a source of constant sorrow and regret
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.340]   as long as thy memory doth last.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.620]   What desirest thou most of this gold in thy wallet?
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.460]   - To keep it safe.
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.220]   - Wisely spoken, replied Mathon approvingly.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.300]   Thy first desire is for safety.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.220]   Thinkest thou that in the custody of thy sister's husband,
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.260]   it would be truly safe from possible loss?
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.020]   - I fear not, for he is not wise in guarding gold.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.940]   - Then be not swayed by foolish sentiments of obligation
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.180]   to trust thy treasure to any person.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.620]   If thou wouldst help thy family or thy friends,
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.860]   find other ways than risking the loss of thy treasure.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.300]   Forget not that gold slippeth away in unexpected ways
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.140]   from those unskilled in guarding it.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.220]   As well, waste thy treasure in extravagance
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.460]   as let others lose it for thee.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.220]   What next after safety
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.380]   dost desire of this treasure of thine?
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.460]   - That it earn more gold.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.360]   - Again, thou speakest with wisdom.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.460]   It should be made to earn and grow larger.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.180]   Gold wisely lent may even double itself
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.420]   with its earnings before a man like you groweth old.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.260]   If you risk losing it,
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.700]   you risk losing all that it would earn as well.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.500]   Therefore, be not swayed by the fantastic plans
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.380]   of the impractical men who think they see ways
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.980]   to force thy gold to make earnings unusually large.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.980]   Such plans are the creations of dreamers,
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.820]   unskilled in the safe and dependable laws of trade.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.400]   Be conservative in what thou expected to earn,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.960]   that thou mayest keep and enjoy thy treasure.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.220]   To hire it out with a promise of usurious returns
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.500]   is to invite loss.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.420]   Seek to associate thyself with men and enterprises
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.940]   whose success is established
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.260]   that thy treasure may earn liberally
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.900]   under their skillful use
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.980]   and be guarded safely by their wisdom and experience.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.380]   Thus mayest thou avoid the misfortunes
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.780]   that follow most of the sons of men
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.420]   to whom the gods see fit to entrust gold.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.180]   When Rodin would thank him for his wise advice,
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.820]   he would not listen, saying,
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.780]   "The king's gift shall teach thee much wisdom.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.380]   If wouldst keep thy 50 pieces of gold,
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.980]   thou must be discreet indeed.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.900]   Many uses will tempt thee.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.540]   Much advice will be spoken to thee.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.340]   Numerous opportunities to make large profits
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.980]   will be offered thee.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.460]   The stories from my token box should warn thee
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.900]   before thou let any piece of gold leave thy pouch
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.380]   to be sure that thou hast a safe way to pull it back again.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.180]   Should my further advice appeal to thee, return again.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.380]   It is gladly given.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.100]   Ere thou goest, read this,
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.060]   which I have carved beneath the lid of my token box.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.360]   It applies equally to the borrower and the lender.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:48.740]   Better a little caution than a great regret."
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.100]   The holidays start here at Ralph's
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.420]   with a variety of options

[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.940]   your go-to shrimp cocktail,

[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.640]   [music fades out]
