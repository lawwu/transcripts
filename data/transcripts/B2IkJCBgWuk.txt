[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Well, there are many wonderful things to come by way of the instruction of the Lord that's
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.200]   going to be given through those who will be ministering to you, and I count it a joy to
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.600]   kind of lead off this morning.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.120]   In thinking about what I might talk about, I guess maybe just a bit of a preface.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.760]   I have felt for, I think, the entire duration of my ministry that the church has suffered
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.720]   from an inadequate understanding of the doctrine that relates to sanctification.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.360]   And even in recent years when we are pretty astute on the doctrine of justification, and
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.760]   we have that down pretty well, as you heard in the beautiful hymn that was sung earlier,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.960]   Israel is for mine, we understand that.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.220]   And there is uniformity on that among those who are faithful to the Word of God.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.480]   We get that.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:14.560]   We go back to the reformers, and we hold their flag and sustain their impact by holding the
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.880]   same convictions that many of them discovered in a time when it was obscured.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.120]   So I think in general we do well with the doctrine of justification.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.480]   We even do pretty well with the doctrine of the sovereignty of God.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.820]   That's a comfortable doctrine for us.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.440]   We want that to be true.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.400]   But where the church seems to lose its way is in the matter of sanctification, and that
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:57.560]   is no small issue, because the function of the church is to address in the lives of God's
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.920]   people the issue of sanctification.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   I don't need to give you illustrations of the condition of "evangelicalism" with regard
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.020]   to sanctification.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:21.760]   We have lots of unsanctified people, and we have apparently lots of unsanctified leaders,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.360]   and lots of discussion about justification and the sovereignty of God, but very little
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   interest in, at least in my mind, in the very foundational reality of sanctification.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.840]   I want to see if I can reduce that to the most simple approach, and that is this.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.340]   I want to talk to you this morning on the triumph of obedience.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.440]   Now there's an odd word, obedience.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.480]   Is that an oxymoron, the triumph of obedience?
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   Can obedience be triumphant?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.480]   Is submission some kind of victory?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:27.280]   There is not only indifference toward the idea of obedience, there is resistance to
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.560]   the reality of obedience.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.240]   A contemporary church leader who rejects outright the idea of obedience reduced the Christian
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:47.800]   life to this absurd question, quote, "What are you going to do now that you don't have
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.760]   to do anything?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.520]   What are you going to do now that you don't have to do anything?"
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.480]   That's the latest version of the "let go and let God."
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.000]   Another author said, "We are not under law.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.560]   We are not under law," repeating it.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.940]   "You can't live under duty.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.000]   You can't live under bondage of necessary obedience.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.600]   You are free in Christ, free from necessary obedience."
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.280]   I know there are people who think they're protecting justification by faith with such
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.240]   an idea, and I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt and think that primarily
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.300]   they're motivated by the desire to protect justification.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:55.240]   But it seems to me a very convenient theology for those who are hiding a life of sin.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:06.560]   To calm their tortured conscience, they come up with a notion that obedience is an offense
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:15.000]   to God if enacted under the sense of duty.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.560]   Antinomianism is an old heresy, and it won't go away.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.760]   It just won't go away.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.200]   It survives in every generation of the church.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.740]   You can go back to the early years in our ministry here and writing a book called The
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.440]   Gospel According to Jesus, which addressed a form of antinomianism where you could be
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.420]   saved and not be transformed, and not even necessarily continue to believe.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.500]   There was no connection between repentance and salvation, no connection between good
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.320]   works as a fruit of salvation and salvation.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.600]   Some of you remember those issues in the book The Gospel According to Jesus and The Gospel
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:14.800]   According to the Apostles, discussions about cheap grace and easy believism.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.840]   There has been a sort of comfort with isolating justification from sanctification.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.480]   And as long as you get justification right, sanctification doesn't matter that much.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.140]   And again, the motive is to protect - at least externally, the motive is to protect the gospel
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.140]   from legalism.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.360]   But again, I question that.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.480]   Sinclair Ferguson has written a book called The Whole Christ.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.840]   Listen to this statement, "The wholesale removal of the law seems to provide a refuge
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.140]   for the antinomian.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:03.680]   But the problem is not the law, but the heart that remains unchanged."
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.320]   This is the delusion.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.360]   The antinomian thinks he is free from the law, but he is not.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.560]   He is still bound to the law.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.440]   He is still a legalist.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.160]   He seeks in going the opposite direction of rejecting the law to be free from the law,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.460]   but this is his delusion.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.920]   The truth is the antinomian is still a legalist.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   Why?
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.280]   Because he is defining his relationship to God by the law.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.980]   The legalist must keep the law to please God, and the antinomian must not keep the law to
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.280]   please God.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.640]   And so he relates to the law.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.440]   The antinomian is as much a legalist as the rigid law keeper.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   He has not escaped.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.720]   He is not free from the law.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   True salvation - and this is the important thing - is never defined by someone's relationship
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.800]   to the law.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.680]   It is defined by someone's relationship to Christ.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   Trusting, honoring, glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ, and especially loving Him and loving
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.420]   His Word breaks the bondage of the law.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:49.580]   The antinomian who thinks he is free from the law, free from the duty to obey the law,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:58.180]   usually reveals that he has no relationship to Christ at all.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:06.140]   If you're defining your relationship to God by your relationship to the law, you may well
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:12.300]   be outside the kingdom of God.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:25.140]   Antinomianism perverts the gospel by making nothing of the divine work of regeneration.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.620]   It doesn't acknowledge that.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.540]   Trying to earn salvation by indifference to the law is no different than trying to earn
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.660]   salvation by adherence to the law.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.760]   The only way you can be certain of your salvation is to know that you have a relationship not
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.300]   to the law, but to Christ.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:10:04.100]   Antinomians make duty and obedience a sin against grace.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.420]   What a trap.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:13.140]   If you don't obey the commands, you sin.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:19.340]   And then if you do obey the commands, you sin.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:29.740]   A true believer would have to deny the new birth to reject his duty to obey the law of
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.220]   God.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.300]   And what drives that?
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.740]   Why is it that a true believer obeys the law of God?
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.060]   Well follow with some familiar portions of Scripture.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:51.680]   Turn to John 14, and this is by way of reminder this morning, things with which you are familiar.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:11:04.160]   John 14, verse 15, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.520]   If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:15.200]   In other words, if you have a relationship with Me, you will be obedient.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.720]   John verse 21, "He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.640]   he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.300]   to him."
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:42.300]   This is intense, and this is saying obedience is directly related to love.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:50.080]   Verse 23, Jesus said to one of His disciples, Judas Not-Iscariot, "If anyone loves Me,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.480]   he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.520]   abode with him.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.360]   He who does not love Me does not keep My word."
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.860]   Or to say it in reverse, "He who does not keep My word does not love Me."
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:17.200]   I mean, this is foundational; we can't avoid this.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:26.560]   Over in the 15th chapter, verse 10, in that upper room, Jesus again repeated the same
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   truth.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.860]   "If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.200]   commandments and abide in His love."
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:44.700]   Or verse 14, "You're My friends if you do what I command you."
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:53.480]   I know you know these, but I want them fresh in your mind, these wonderful statements.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:01.740]   Listen to 1 John 3:24, "The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.360]   Him.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.320]   We know by this that He abides in us by the Spirit whom He has given us.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.560]   If you have no desire to obey His commandments, then you have no love for Him.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.160]   You're not abiding in Him; you don't know Him."
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.880]   Once again in chapter 5, verse 2 of 1 John, "By this we know that we love the children
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.000]   of God when we love God and observe His commandments.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.520]   For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments, and His commandments are
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   not - " what?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.360]   " - burdensome, because they're kept out of love."
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.680]   That defines a true believer.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.180]   His relation is to the Lord, not the law.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.920]   But because he loves the Lord, he loves the law of the Lord, which Psalm 138.2 says, "God
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:08.200]   has exalted His word equal to His name."
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   He loves because the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:21.280]   He has a love then defined by obedience, by obedience.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.460]   That ought to be obvious from the Great Commission.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:33.260]   The Great Commission states that in no uncertain terms, "Go, therefore, and make disciples
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.240]   of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:44.880]   Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you."
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.860]   What is discipleship?
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.300]   It's teaching people to be obedient.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.740]   I get that; I understand that.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.500]   I'm not very mystical.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:12.540]   If you tell me, "Here is what God requires, and you are to obey," then I understand that.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:18.220]   That's sanctification's pathway.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:26.460]   So based on what we just saw, and wrapped up in Matthew 28, what should be the goal
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.460]   of ministry?
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.620]   To produce people who are what?
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.300]   Obedient, obedient.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:48.260]   Not people who are chasing some sentimentalism or some esoteric experience, but people who
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.300]   are obedient.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.380]   What is the goal of pastoral ministry?
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:02.580]   I'll give you some more, because I just want you to hear these familiar texts to refresh
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.580]   your mind.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:17.180]   Paul said in Galatians 4:19, "My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.260]   is formed in you."
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:29.420]   The goal of ministry is to be like Christ, right?
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.340]   Ephesians says essentially the same thing in chapter 4.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.260]   He gave some as apostles and prophets, evangelists; some as pastor-teachers.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.620]   "For the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.060]   of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.740]   of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740]   of Christ."
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:17:08.780]   So the whole ministry that you're engaged in is to take people on the pathway to Christlikeness.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:17.460]   You are there to enrich their relationship to Him.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:30.740]   In Colossians chapter 1, again, same thing, verse 27, talks about Christ in you, the hope
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.260]   of glory.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.640]   And then Paul says in verse 28, "We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.760]   man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.280]   For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power which mightily works within me."
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.340]   Christlikeness is the goal.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:58.700]   Again, the whole pathway of sanctification is becoming more like Christ.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:10.940]   It's defined by one's relationship to Christ, not his relationship to the law.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:22.660]   In 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 3, Paul basically said something very similar.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.420]   And then we'll look at chapter 10, which is kind of where I'm headed.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:35.780]   He says in chapter 11, "I'm jealous for you," verse 2, "with a godly jealousy, for I betrothed
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:42.020]   you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.180]   But I'm afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.580]   led away or astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ."
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.820]   There is sanctification right there.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.100]   It's the simplicity and devotion to Christ.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.860]   It's loving Christ.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:08.140]   And to be like Christ is to be obedient.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.780]   He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.620]   Hebrews 5, "He learned obedience by the things He suffered."
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.460]   He only did what the Father told Him to do.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.940]   He only did what the Father willed for Him to do.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.860]   He only did what pleased the Father.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:36.740]   The goal that we have as shepherds and pastors is the sanctification of our people, conformity
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.420]   to Christ.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:45.100]   And the more they know Christ, the more they love Christ, the more eagerly they obey His
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.060]   commands.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:20:01.380]   Now to focus a little more on one text, turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 10, chapter 10.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:08.380]   This passage has been on my mind, and I hope I can make this helpful to you, looking at
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.020]   it in a number of ways.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:16.500]   I'm going to read starting in verse 1, 2 Corinthians 10.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:25.580]   "Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ," - again, the standard
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:35.820]   for all that Paul requires is Christ - "I who am meek, He's meek, so I'm meek when face
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.100]   to face with you, but bold toward you when absent.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.820]   I ask that when I am present, I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:52.740]   to be courageous against some who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:58.740]   For though we walk in the flesh," - we're human - "we do not war according to the flesh,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.340]   for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.220]   of fortresses.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.620]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.180]   and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are ready
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:23.500]   to punish all disobedience whenever your obedience is complete."
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:30.260]   Do you see your pastoral duty there?
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.980]   Your duty is to take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ and to punish the
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.980]   disobedient.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:49.820]   I don't know if you've ever thought of ministry like that, but that's what Paul says God requires.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.860]   Let's look at verse 5 for a moment.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:02.080]   The last part of the verse, "We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.340]   Christ."
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.480]   That's the goal.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.260]   It's about obedience.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:15.340]   It's about obedience to Him personally.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:22.340]   And we know His will, because as 1 Corinthians 2 says, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.380]   That's not something personal like, "I think I know what Jesus feels."
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.960]   We have the mind of Christ because we have the Bible.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:41.060]   We know what He wills, what pleases Him, what honors Him.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:50.820]   And our calling is to bring our people to the place where every thought is captive to
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.140]   Christ.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.360]   Now notice the beginning of the verse.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:06.600]   He says, "We are destroying speculations."
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:16.080]   That's ideologies, philosophies, theories, viewpoints, opinions.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.820]   Even - Kai, better translated "even" - even every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.740]   of God.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:32.240]   This is Paul's direct ministry.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:40.900]   We destroy anti-God ideologies.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.460]   He sees himself as a soldier, really.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:53.700]   The terminology is military, smashing ungodly ideas, smashing ungodly ideologies, smashing
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.940]   lies.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:02.260]   And they're called "fortresses" back in verse 4.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:10.020]   That is a word that means "fortress," it means "prison," and it means "tomb."
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:17.540]   And people are fortified in anti-God ideologies that become their prisons and end up as their
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.420]   tombs.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:33.620]   And the calling we have is to destroy those speculations, destroy those anti-God ideologies.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.940]   And the only way to do that is with the truth, and then you take every thought captive to
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.740]   the obedience of Christ.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.500]   Graphic language.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:53.100]   The Greek verb there means to take prisoners with a spear, to take prisoners with a spear.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:02.140]   It's like he's leading these people out of their smashed fortress to a new captivity,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.660]   and they're being led with a spear.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.040]   This is demanded of them.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:22.300]   And every noema , that means "thought, reasoning, design, purpose."
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.660]   It's translated "minds" in 2 Corinthians 4.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:38.460]   So Paul's objective in ministry is to destroy the anti-God lies and free the deceived minds
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:48.980]   from the bondage of those lies, and bring them captive to a new captor, Christ.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:26:02.520]   He defines that state of conversion as being captive to the obedience of Christ.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.660]   Just beautiful language.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:15.360]   In Romans 6, Paul said, "You were slaves of unrighteousness."
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:23.980]   But when that form of doctrine came that transformed you, you became slaves of righteousness, from
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:29.560]   unrighteousness to righteousness.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:37.480]   The rebellion has ended, and the Christian's life is a life of obedience to Christ, whom
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:44.560]   the Christian loves, not because he has the capacity in his humanity to love like that,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:52.160]   but because he has been regenerated to love like that.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.520]   John 3:36, "He who does not obey the Son will not see life."
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.840]   But the wrath of God abides on him.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.120]   Whatever happened to obedience?
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:12.680]   I mean, you go back even to the gospel.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:20.720]   Romans 1:5 speaks of the obedience of faith among the Gentiles.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.900]   The obedience of faith is describing saving faith.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.200]   It's an act of obedience.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:38.040]   In Romans 2, unbelievers are those who do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:50.400]   And again, at the end of Romans, the obedience of the Gentiles is manifest in word and deed.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   Paul even wraps up Romans, if you look at the final sign-off in verses 25 to 27 of chapter
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.620]   16, "Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.080]   Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.180]   for long ages past, but now is manifested; and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:22.860]   to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.500]   to obedience of faith."
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:35.900]   Saving faith is the first act of obedience a sinner makes.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:44.340]   And you can give God all the glory, as verse 27 says.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:52.300]   Hebrews 5:9 puts it this way, "He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.780]   salvation."
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:06.820]   Peter offers us a beautiful picture of this saving obedience in 1 Peter 1, the first two
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   verses.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.540]   "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to those who reside as aliens scattered throughout
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:19.060]   Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen according to the foreknowledge
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:27.460]   of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.860]   sprinkled with His blood."
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:37.380]   The whole of salvation is an act of obedience.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.660]   And what is the sprinkle of blood referring to?
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:48.440]   Well, that's taking you back to the Old Testament, where the people of Israel thought more of
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.700]   themselves than they ought to have thought.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.540]   And when they made a covenant, they would never violate the law of God, and then they
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.580]   sealed it with blood.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:07.540]   They were saying, "We will obey," but they were not faithful.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:14.140]   It's the obedience of Christ that defines everything.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.820]   That's how you define your Christian life, "Do I obey Christ?"
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.020]   It's not, "What would Jesus do?"
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:30.100]   It's, "What did He command me to do?"
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.860]   And it's time, Peter says in chapter 4, for judgment to begin with the household of God.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:41.620]   And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.620]   of God?
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:48.100]   There in a backhanded way he is saying, "If you're in the household of God, you came because
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:58.020]   you committed yourself to obey God, and you did in a sense symbolically what the people
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:05.180]   of Israel did when they took the blood oath to always obey.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.380]   They failed."
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:20.460]   Saving faith is about obedience, and I don't know why we have to run from that term.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:30.420]   So back to chapter 10 of 2 Corinthians, this is how the relationship to the Lord begins.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:42.340]   You're taking a new allegiance to obedience to a new captor, and you don't have a choice.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:49.300]   You've been brought there by spear, as it were, and your life now is defined by obedience
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.240]   to Christ.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:32:00.940]   And to press that home, Paul says to the Corinthians, "And those of you who are disobedient,
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.360]   I will punish."
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.880]   I don't know if you've ever thought about that in terms of your ministry, punishing
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.960]   the disobedient.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.080]   Now obviously, initially, this is salvation in verse 5.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.980]   But by the time you get to verse 6, Paul is saying, "I'm going to come to that church,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:28.240]   and I'm going to identify those people who perhaps claim to be Christians, but are disobedient,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.420]   and there will be punishment for them."
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.600]   We talk about discipline in the church; I don't know that I've ever heard anybody talk
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.000]   about punishment.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.960]   Obedience prompted by love is the character of the Christian faith and is the reality
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.200]   of sanctification.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.720]   Now why am I emphasizing this today?
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:03.120]   Well, because again, I think this is the world in which we all live.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:13.040]   The work of justification and glorification is all God's work.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.560]   We have the responsibility in the middle for the perfecting of the saints to Christlikeness.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:30.040]   And antinomianism comes in so many forms, and it's left such confusion about sanctification,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.520]   all denying the believer's duty to obey the moral law of God.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.160]   Let me suggest some that I noted.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.740]   First there is a kind of a Gnostic dualism approach to antinomianism, and that says the
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.600]   salvation of the soul is all that matters.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.360]   Bodily behavior is irrelevant because your body's not redeemed, so don't worry about
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   it.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   That has played out in some gross transgressions advocated by pastors.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:10.280]   I know one myself who suggested that couples who are preparing to get married have sex
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:17.640]   together because their bodies weren't redeemed anyway.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:23.560]   So there is that dualistic antinomianism, and then there's I guess what you could call
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:30.000]   God-focused - although it's bad to say it that way, that's what they would say - God-focused
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.120]   antinomianism, which says He just requires love, He just requires love.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:44.680]   And so because He just really requires love, you have to do some, you know, you have to
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:52.880]   do some editing of the Bible, because so much of it is not loving.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:06.080]   But since God is concerned only about love, you have to hold back requirements in Scripture
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.160]   because that wouldn't be loving.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   And then there is Spirit-prompted antinomianism, trusting in the Holy Spirit to move inwardly
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.680]   so as to deny any need to be subject or obedient to the moral law of God.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:29.240]   You're free from the law; just let the Holy Spirit do it.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:36.020]   And if it doesn't happen very well, well, it's probably His fault.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.500]   And then there's Christ-centered antinomianism.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:47.360]   God sees no sin in you anyway, because Christ paid for your sin, and then He kept the law
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.160]   for you.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.760]   So since He kept the law for you, you don't have to worry about keeping it for yourself,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.560]   which you can't do.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.880]   And then there is cross-centered antinomianism.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:13.020]   No need to obey the law; just flee to the cross and preach the cross to yourself.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.980]   And then there is grace-centered antinomianism.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.120]   All sin has been paid for; you're free.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:29.580]   Then there is something that I hadn't come across until recently, lesser-sins antinomianism.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:40.180]   Committing lesser sins keeps you from greater sins by granting your flesh some satisfaction.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:47.740]   All those seek to eliminate obedience to the moral law of God and His holy will, and all
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.580]   of it is an attack on God Himself.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:57.140]   John Murray said, "In the denial of the permanent authority and sanctity of the moral law, there
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:04.340]   is a direct thrust at the very center of our holy faith, for it is a thrust at the veracity
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.660]   and authority of the Lord Himself."
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.860]   We all understand that the law has three uses.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.620]   Use number one is to convict and condemn the sinner.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:24.140]   Use number two is to provide law and order as a common grace in society.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:31.940]   And three, to reveal the commandments that all Christians are to obey.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:41.360]   But people who are antinomian want to get rid of the second and third use of the law.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.800]   Listen to this quote, "The law of God is holy, just, and good.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:53.260]   But it becomes a very great evil when it is perverted and used for something other than
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:59.860]   its divine purpose, one singular purpose.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:07.380]   It expresses man's guilt before God, shutting him up to faith in Christ alone for salvation.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:20.340]   To use God's law for any other purpose is to pervert and abuse the law."
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:30.120]   When you think of the law of God and obedience to that law as an act of abuse, you have a
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.800]   twisted view.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   You say, "Well, the law is old covenant."
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.880]   Well, the law is old covenant.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.600]   Maybe I ought to take a few minutes and show you something.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.880]   Let's go back to Deuteronomy 6.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:56.000]   I want you to see that the law is old covenant because the law reflects God's will.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.040]   Listen to Deuteronomy 6.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.560]   "Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments, which the Lord your God
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.080]   has commanded Me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you're going over
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.600]   to possess it."
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   Very familiar text.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.080]   "So that you and your sons and your grandson might fear the Lord your God to keep all His
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.400]   statutes and His commandments, which I command you all the days of your life, and that your
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.280]   days may be prolonged."
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.820]   That's God's will, "Keep all His commandments all your life long."
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:34.160]   Be obedient, be obedient.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.920]   That's the foundation.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.080]   And to help you with that, you need to love the Lord your God with all your heart and
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.480]   soul and all your might in verse 5.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.440]   And then verse 6, "These words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart."
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.980]   This is the key.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.480]   "You shall teach them diligently to your sons and talk of them when you sit down, when
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:02.640]   you walk in the way, lie down, rise up, find them as a sign on your hand and as frontals
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.000]   on your forehead, symbolic of having to think through the law of God when you work and when
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.080]   you think.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.840]   Write them on the doorposts of your house."
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.640]   You know that.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:19.400]   The command then is to obey the law of God.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:33.600]   Or in Deuteronomy 30, just very similarly, Deuteronomy 30, and we'll just look at verse
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.800]   1 and following, "So it shall be when all the things have come upon you," and after
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.560]   the pronouncing of blessing and cursing.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:51.740]   After this, verse 2, "You will return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:57.620]   and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons."
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:02.840]   This is again the same emphasis on obedience.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.800]   Verse 8, "You shall again obey the Lord and observe all His commandments which I command
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.040]   you today."
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.160]   Verse 10, "If you obey the Lord your God to keep His commandments and statutes written
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:26.360]   in the book of the law, if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul."
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:35.680]   God wants obedience from the heart, obedience from the heart.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:44.840]   Psalm 37:31, "Of the righteous God said this, 'The law of His God is in His heart.'"
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.400]   That's a divine work.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.440]   Psalm 40, verse 8, David says, "I delight to do Your will, O my God.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.960]   Your law is within my heart."
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:06.560]   The law was not just external in the old covenant; it was in the heart.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.760]   Turn to Psalm 119.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:16.720]   I don't know if you ever thought about the psalm, the way I'm going to address it.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.880]   But Psalm 119.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.280]   Just listen to a few of these wonderful verses.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:36.800]   Verse 57, and you could pick any of them really, 57, that heth portion, "The Lord is my portion.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.560]   I have promised to keep Your words.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.000]   I sought Your favor with all my heart.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.160]   Be gracious to me according to Your word.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.520]   I considered my ways and turned my feet to Your testimonies.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   I hastened and did not delay to keep Your commandments.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.280]   The cords of the wicked have encircled me, but I have not forgotten Your law.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.320]   At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to You because of Your righteous ordinances.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.000]   I am a companion of all those who fear You and of those who keep Your precepts.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.040]   The earth is full of Your lovingkindness, O Lord; teach me Your statutes."
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.240]   Go over to verse 97, "O how I love Your law!
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.380]   It is my meditation all the day.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.520]   Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies; they are ever mine.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.320]   I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.440]   I understand more than the aged because I have observed Your precepts.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.760]   I have restrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Your word."
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:42.520]   I love verse 103, "How sweet are Your words to my taste; yes, sweeter than honey to my
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   mouth."
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:55.920]   Do you think that was written by a legalist?
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.840]   That was not written by a legalist.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:09.880]   I think go back to Psalm 51, any more than Psalm 19 or Psalm 1.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.560]   Psalm 51, this is the confession of David.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:25.160]   And I think this is a salvation prayer; we've all probably preached on it.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.000]   This comes from David's heart.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.960]   I think this is a salvation prayer.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:39.880]   It sounds like a salvation prayer, even if you put it in the New Testament.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.080]   "Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness."
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.820]   It asks for grace.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:52.240]   "According to the greatness of Your compassion, blot out my transgressions."
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.120]   This is the true sinner's prayer.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.720]   "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:05.400]   Cleanse me from my sin, for I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.040]   Against You, You only, I have sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You're
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:14.280]   justified when You speak and blameless when You judge."
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.000]   He understands the depths of his sin.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.640]   "I was brought forth in iniquity, and sin my mother conceived me."
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:27.360]   From his very conception he bore the fallenness of Adam's race.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.120]   And I know what you want, God.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.380]   You desire truth in the innermost being.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:37.680]   That is not the prayer of a legalist.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.440]   And in the hidden part, "You will make me no wisdom, so, Lord, purify me with hyssop,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.960]   and I shall be clean.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.080]   Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.320]   Make me to hear joy and gladness.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.680]   Let the bones which You have broken rejoice.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.200]   Hide Your face from my sins; blot out all my iniquities."
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.640]   You want a sinner's prayer, that's it.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   That's a salvation prayer.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.120]   And look at verse 10, "Created me" - what?
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.080]   - "a clean heart."
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:15.320]   David knew he needed a new heart, and he needed a new spirit.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:21.640]   And that's the language of Jeremiah 31, isn't it?
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.440]   "Don't cast me away from Your presence.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.800]   Don't take Your Holy Spirit from me.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.480]   Restore to me the joy of Your salvation.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.960]   Sustain me with a willing spirit.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.400]   I need a new spirit.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.080]   I need a new heart.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.240]   And then I will be able to teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will be converted to
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   You.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.840]   I will be useful to You."
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:47:00.360]   That's the sinner's prayer in David's experience that led him to the reality of Psalm 119.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:16.960]   And Isaiah 51:7 says that God desires His law in the heart, in the heart.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.540]   And that's exactly what you have with David.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.240]   So as Abraham is a prototype of faith in the Old Testament because he was justified by
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.680]   faith, he believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness, David is a prototype
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:42.240]   of a sanctified believer who was given a new heart and a new spirit.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.840]   And what you have in, for example, Jeremiah 31 is the promise that that's going to happen
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.680]   to the whole nation of Israel.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.840]   But it wasn't as if it never happened.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.500]   You don't think for a moment, do you, that people in the Old Testament were converted
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:02.720]   in some other way.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.280]   David knew what he needed - a new heart, a new spirit.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.840]   He needed a new creation.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:20.600]   And when that new creation took place in his life, Psalm 119 became the testimony of his
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:32.120]   love for his God that showed up in his desire for obedience.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.360]   God wants the law in the heart.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.960]   He always has.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.640]   He always has.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.360]   And David kept that law because he would rather do that than anything else.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.320]   So if you are running from the law of God under some misconception of your spiritual
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:57.640]   condition, if you're fleeing from that, you need what David needed - a new heart, a new
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:04.700]   spirit, a new creation.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:17.080]   So Paul's ministry was to destroy fortresses, and then to take prisoner those who had been
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.120]   liberated and make them obedient to Christ.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:32.680]   In fact, it's so basic, it's so clearly the point that Jesus said, "Why do you call me
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.120]   Lord?
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   Not do what I say."
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:41.060]   It's completely inconsistent.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:53.360]   So let's take a look just in wrapping up 2 Corinthians chapter 10 again.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.960]   How did Paul approach this ministry?
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.880]   We'll just touch lightly on it.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.680]   First of all, he was compassionate.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:10.080]   If you're going to be confronting people with their obedience or their disobedience, you
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.860]   find here a model for how to do this effectively.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.300]   Number one, he was compassionate.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:26.600]   He said, "I urge you" - speaking to the Corinthians with all their issues - "I who am meek when
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:32.380]   face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent," being sarcastic in saying that,
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.560]   because that was the criticism of him.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:40.040]   But you start out, if you're going to call people to obedience, and that's going to be
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:46.080]   the direction of your ministry, there needs to be compassion, meekness, and gentleness,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.940]   the very meekness and gentleness of Christ.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.700]   Some in Corinth saw Paul's meekness and gentleness as weakness.
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:04.980]   He responded a little bit with sarcasm, but he had to be compassionate because the Lord
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.980]   was compassionate.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:14.740]   But he was also courageous, verse 2, "I ask that when I am present, I need not be bold
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:20.560]   with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some who regard us as
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.900]   if we walked according to the flesh."
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.460]   He is not weak.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.380]   He will be bold.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.580]   He will be courageous.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:38.140]   He will confront those who are undermining his authority and his ministry, those who
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:44.220]   are accusing him of walking in the flesh.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.500]   So he kind of had it come in both ways.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:51.180]   If he did nothing, they said he was weak; if he did something, they said he was fleshly.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.020]   But the balance is there, and sometimes hard to achieve.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:59.020]   On the one hand, the apostle said, "I can be courageous."
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:05.020]   On the other hand, "I can be compassionate," and finding the balance may be a challenge.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.980]   Maybe more significantly, he was competent, competent.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:18.340]   In verse 4, "The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful."
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:23.260]   If you got into an argument with the apostle Paul, if you were confronted by the apostle
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:29.300]   Paul, to do battle with Paul was to do battle with a man who had a massive arsenal of divine
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.060]   truth at his disposal.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:40.720]   You didn't want to engage with him without realizing that your human arguments couldn't
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:47.380]   withstand the power of Paul's divine weapons.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:55.700]   So he says, "In ministry I have been compassionate; I have been, when I needed to be, courageous.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:04.460]   I am competent in wielding the truth with such effectiveness that it has destroyed the
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.020]   fortresses."
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.360]   Just two other thoughts here.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:16.980]   He was committed, verse 6, "We are ready to punish all disobedience."
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:27.120]   Again, this is such an interesting statement, as if the pastor is to be the one inflicting
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.540]   punishment.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:36.640]   But for the sake of the purity of the church, Paul would do that, did do that.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.560]   So he was compassionate, he was courageous, he was competent.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.640]   He was committed.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.720]   He was ready to punish all disobedience.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.600]   And one final note, he was cautious.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:58.480]   He says in verse 6 at the end that punishment would occur whenever your obedience is complete.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.280]   What are you waiting for?
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:08.200]   I'm waiting for the obvious, meaning all who are obedient are known.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.320]   So what he is saying is, "The people who are obedient don't need to be punished.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:21.360]   The people who are not obedient, they're the ones that need to be dealt with."
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   He would put them to the test.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.760]   If we had time, you can go through chapters 10 through 13 where he talks even more about
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.880]   that.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.240]   So his pastoral ministry was about this issue.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:40.680]   "I will be compassionate to you until I can't be, and I have to be courageous.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:46.840]   And when the conflict comes, you will have to face the weapons of divine truth for your
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:53.440]   misdeeds, your rebellion.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:59.560]   And I'm committed to do whatever I need to do for the purity of the church.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:07.200]   But not until it's clear who are the obedient ones and who are the disobedient ones."
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:15.240]   He would be cautious and careful.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:24.920]   So as we think about the triumph of obedience, I think we have to introduce that back into
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   the vocabulary of the church.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.520]   It's been absent.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:46.800]   Father, we thank You for the time this morning to consider something so basic, so foundational.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:54.920]   Lord, how can we possibly fulfill our calling?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:02.080]   How can we possibly conform a congregation to Christ?
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:10.480]   How can we build them to the fullness of the stature of Christ unless, like Him, they become
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:18.040]   obedient to You?
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.360]   It's not complicated.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:30.120]   We don't need to find some mystical path, some meditation or contemplation.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:39.160]   We need to do what Paul said, "I beat my body to bring it into submission."
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:52.000]   Lord, give us the strength in Your Spirit to subdue the flesh and obey out of a heart
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:03.480]   of love, so full of love, that obedience is our highest joy.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.240]   That's our prayer.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.520]   In Christ's name.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   Amen.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   Amen.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   Amen.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   [applause]
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.040]   [music]
